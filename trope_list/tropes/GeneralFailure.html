</p><p>Common phrases of the General usually include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WroteTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WroteTheBook">"I wrote the manual on military tactic X,"</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMunchausen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMunchausen">"This reminds me of the time we fought enemy X in an improbable location, what a tale that is!"</a>
</p><p>General Failure may have started out as a competent commander in a position of less importance, and his success led to him being promoted beyond his capabilities.

General Failure is essentially the personification of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">Failure Is the Only Option</a>, and is the eventual destination of severe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay">Villain Decay</a>. He often bears similarities to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeidermeyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeidermeyer">The Neidermeyer</a>, but on a much higher scale. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmchairMilitary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmchairMilitary">Armchair Military</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilesGloriosus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilesGloriosus">Miles Gloriosus</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModernMajorGeneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModernMajorGeneral">Modern Major General</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss">Pointy-Haired Boss</a> is a similar non-military trope.
</p><p>Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass">Four-Star Badass</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">General Ripper</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass">Colonel Badass</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock">Sergeant Rock</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurroundedByIdiots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurroundedByIdiots">Surrounded by Idiots</a>.
</p><p>This trope does not happen too much in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>. Really incompetent officers usually never even graduate from the military academy: incompetent officers mostly don't tend to get promoted past Captain (Lieutenant in the Navy) level. Most real life officers appearing as General Failures are simply unlucky ones (and conversely many military "geniuses" just got lucky and afterwards announced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IMeantToDoThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IMeantToDoThat">I Meant to Do That</a>).
</p><p>Granted, in the mid-19th Century and prior, there was (more room for) nepotism, and military ranks and jobs had to be bought and were only available to people of the right class/social standing. But even then there were limits to how much incompetence a military establishment would tolerate before either you got demoted, or some of the people dying under your command saw to it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfriendlyFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfriendlyFire">you got hit by a stray bullet</a>, or you and your remaining troops were captured by a foe with more competent leaders.
</p><p>This isn't to say incompetence <em>doesn't</em> exist within <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> militaries, of course. It's just that usually, it can't be pinned down to one person. More often than not, bad decisions are made by several people due to a combination of factors involving miscommunication between personnel, an outdated and hoplessly bloated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VastBureaucracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VastBureaucracy">Vast Bureaucracy</a>, a culture and power structure that encourages higher ranking individuals to interfere in the work of lower ranking personnel despite having no expertise in their field (think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, but for armies instead of TV Networks), and to top it all off, good old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComplainerIsAlwaysWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComplainerIsAlwaysWrong">groupthink</a>. In other words, it's not a leadership problem, it's a structural problem.
</p><p>Real life General Failures may have existed and were quite notorious, but they alone were only responsible for a <em>fraction</em> of military blunders through history.

<ul><li> A very common problem at the Empire's armies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AlderaminOnTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AlderaminOnTheSky">Alderamin on the Sky</a></em> is that they love putting rank ahead of competence or experience, meaning soldiers constantly fight hopeless battles to cover up for their superiors' incompetence, usually at the cost of the lives of competent officers.
<ul><li> And the worst offender has to be L.T. Colonel Safida: the guy couldn't even put together a shopping list if his life depended on it, with his overworked and unthanked top subordinate keeping the regiment together. He orders pointless and cruel attacks on the native population, and when they rightfully rebel, he gets several battalions of his army killed by ignoring environmental conditions (like mountain sickness). He even gives a hostile nation a perfect excuse to launch a jihad thanks to his constant abuse towards spirits. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thankfully, he's court-martialed and executed for his war crimes once the situation is resolved by the protagonists.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Keith Shadis from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> views himself as this, being the previous commander of the Survey Corps before Erwin Smith succeeded him in the post. Returning home to Shiganshina from yet another costly expedition, he comes before the mother of a soldier who died under his command, suffering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> when he admits to the grieving woman and all those around him that his and the sacrifice of everyone before him has been entirely senseless and that nothing has been gained in their forays into the Titan-infested lands beyond the Walls.
</li><li> Lord Gennon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> outnumbered his enemy six to one at the battle of Doldrey and had both a massive borderline-unassailable fortress and one of the best knightly orders in the Empire under his command. Had he simply stepped back, stayed behind the walls, and let his knights do their work, the battle would have been an easy victory. Instead, he decides to lead out most of the army in a disorganized sortie to capture the enemy commander, and doesn't even bother to close the fortress doors behind them.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> with the Red Ribbon Army. The leader, Commander Red, has been hunting for the Dragon Balls for months and his men have been routinely slaughtered by Goku. He wants the Dragon Balls so he can wish to become taller. However, his subordinates don't know that and when his second in command, Adjutant Black, finds out (he assumed they were going to wish for world domination) he executes Red in disgust and becomes leader of the <em>Black</em> Ribbon Army.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> wants <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">blood to create a giant transmutation circle</span> so he intentionally has the ruler of Amestris put idiots as Generals since they are easy to control, and their incompetence will not only kill the enemy but their own men as well. When they tried to get Olivier Armstrong to join their inner circle, let's just say things got ugly.....for the General Numbnuts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em>: If you want an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteXenophobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteXenophobe">Absolute Xenophobe</a> of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">General Ripper</a>, Colonel Bosque Ohm of the Titans is your man. If you want a military leader who actually <em>accomplishes</em> anything other than gassing colony after colony of innocent civilians... best look elsewhere. This guy is so hellbent on gassing Spacenoids that he literally assigns a colony gassing operation as the <em>very first mission</em> for a new defector from the AEUG. Luckily for him said defector doesn't have much moral fiber and goes through with the colony gassing. Unsurprisingly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah">Dark Messiah</a> Paptimus Scirocco doesn't think much of him, and even resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Psycho for Hire</a> Yazan Gable doesn't hesitate to shoot him down on Scirocco's orders.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em>: Quinze of the White Fang isn't completely evil (unlike most other <em>Gundam</em> examples on this list), but he still needs to drop to his knees and thank the deity of his choice every day that Milliardo Peacecraft chose to join up with him, as battles never seem to work out for his group when he's the one calling the shots (even in a prequel manga!). Interestingly, it is implied he may be <em>aware</em> of this and sought out Milliardo for this very reason.
</li><li> Two examples from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em>:

However, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Troper/StarSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Troper/StarSword">Star Sword</a> compared him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">General Ambrose Burnside</a> in that he <em>knows</em> he's not fit for the job, but is being kept there (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoleInCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoleInCharge">Starfleet's chief is an Undine infiltrator</a>). He ultimately resigns from Starfleet to <em>force</em> himself to be replaced, and the much more militarily talented Stephen Alcott is able to turn things around dramatically.
</li><li> The Klingons have several turn up, especially in Third Fleet, after the Great Houses start meddling in warfighting to advance their political goals. Admiral Alcott takes advantage of this when he begins his counteroffensive.

In the books, he is actually a pretty decent leader, and his only fault is that he spends <em>too much</em> time on the battlefield (and once again, trusts Roodaka too much). Unfortunately, the writers picked up his negative portrayal, and now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> claims he actually <em>was</em> a weakling who had cheated his way to glory, specifically stealing credit for one of <em>Roodaka's</em> best accomplishments (he took credit for having the idea she ultimately carried out, which got them leader and viceroy of the Visorak horde in the first place). That said, the books also mention that he <em>knows</em> he's incompetent and makes a show of always putting on a strong front and leading on the battlefield to assuage others and himself, which blinds him to Roodaka's manipulations, likely as an attempt to mold the two portrayals together.

War hero 'Bullshot' Crummond keeps running into former members of his WW1 regiment "The Royal Loamshires", who have been mutilated in various ways due to his incompetence.
</li><li> The 1968 version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheChargeOfTheLightBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheChargeOfTheLightBrigade">The Charge of the Light Brigade</a></em> is <em>made</em> of this trope.

</li><li> Adolf Hitler is presented as this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Downfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Downfall">Downfall</a></em>. Hitler revokes control of his troops from his more experienced (and sane) commanders for perceived failures and increasingly tries to micromanage his units. He disparages the generals in Berlin as idiots who don't know what they're doing. Despite this he himself shows a weak grasp of tactics by declaring that battalions and divisions on the verge of being overrun <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">will hold their ground and fight</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonourBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonourBeforeReason">no matter what</a>, and at times even grossly overestimating the fighting capacity of units which are so under-supplied and under-manned that they may as well not exist. Even the other members of his inner circle give each other nervous looks as he makes these costly decisions. After the last offensive ordered by his generals, Unternehmen Zitadelle/The Battle of Kursk of July 1943, failed and lead to a spectacular reversal which cost them Ukraine and all the Reich's (experienced) Panzer forces, this became Truth in Television for the remainder of the war.
</li><li> General Brigham from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EdgeOfTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EdgeOfTomorrow">Edge of Tomorrow</a></em> is an interesting example. It's actually unclear how competent he is, because the enemy's time-travel abilities mean that they can retroactively turn any decision he makes into the worst possible one. The overall effect is of a particularly spectacular General Failure, but only because he's unaware of his outlandish situation and has understandably serious difficulty wrapping his brain around it once he is informed.
</li><li> Though no specific generals are pointed out, this is the general message in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronEagle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronEagle">Iron Eagle</a></em>, where the protagonist (Doug Masters) has to steal an F-16 from the Air Force to save his dad because the government won't do anything about Doug's dad being held by an unnamed Arab country somewhere in "the Med."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Kagemusha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Kagemusha">Kagemusha</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound">Katsuyori Takeda</a> disregards the defensive strategy set by his father and the other generals, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with catastrophic results</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingdomOfHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingdomOfHeaven">Kingdom of Heaven</a></em> depicts Guy of Lusignan as this. An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InadequateInheritor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InadequateInheritor">Inadequate Inheritor</a> to the role of King of Jerusalem, his big break as commander of its armies is to abandon a position next to a lake to instead march armored soldiers through miles of desert without any kind of real resource chain to meet the armies of Saladin. Needless to say, half his troops seem to be dying of dehydration before the battle even starts. (This is largely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>; there's a reason the Battle of Hattin is so often described with labels like "greatest military disasters.")
</li><li> Brad Whitaker from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLivingDaylights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLivingDaylights">The Living Daylights</a></em> is explicitly mentioned as being such, or rather is mentioned as having failed to achieve any true military rank within the U.S. Armed Forces due to having cheated while studying at West Point. So instead, he resorted to arms smuggling across the world's war-torn regions, making a fortune through his dealings and becoming a self-styled colonel of sorts, even entering a partnership with the Soviets to supply their war in Afghanistan. However, for all of his fascination with military power, those who know better of his military service rarely hesitate to point out that his rank is in truth self-appointed.
</li><li> General Zod from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManOfSteel">Man of Steel</a></em> is a tragic case of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> turned into one of these because he couldn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrewBeyondTheirProgramming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrewBeyondTheirProgramming">grow beyond his own programming</a>. The product of an alien <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperBreedingProgram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperBreedingProgram">Super Breeding Program</a>, Zod was conceived from day one to be a military leader, and as a result can't conceive of any other way to approach problems other than through overwhelming force. If he'd been of a less forceful temperament he could have allied with his old friend Jor-El, but instead he launches a coup d'état against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Obstructive Bureaucrat</a>-laden Council that rules Krypton, turning Jor-El against him (though unwittingly also saving himself and his subordinates from dying with the world). Later his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">Attack! Attack! Attack!</a> mentality hamstrings him again when he decides to re-establish the Kryptonian race. Despite being in possession of a terraforming device that would allow him to transform any planet in our galaxy into one habitable to Kryptonians, he decides to go to war with the one <em>inhabited</em> planet in said galaxy, which alienates yet another El against him and mires him in another war he can't win. Perhaps most tragic is that Zod seems <em>aware</em> on some level that he is self-sabotaging his own efforts, as seen in a melancholy dialogue with a program of his old friend Jor-El and later a flat-out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntagonistInMourning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntagonistInMourning">Antagonist in Mourning</a> speech when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kal exiles every other Kryptonian but him back to the Phantom Zone</span>. Most Failures here are so by their own pride and stupidity, but Zod is a failure because he's literally hardwired to be one.
</li><li> The second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightAtTheMuseum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightAtTheMuseum">Night at the Museum</a></em> film has the reanimated General George A. Custer, who has more bravado than good sense. His great plan to surprise the enemy is to loudly announce his decision to attack before attacking. When the flaw is pointed out, he thinks for a while and comes up with a "better" plan: loudly announce they're <em>not</em> going to attack, and then attack. Later on in the film however, he admits that he is indeed an incompetent fraud whose greatest achievement is leading his men to their deaths in a moment of panic.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ran">Ran</a></em>, Jiro deliberately ignores Kurogane's veteran military wisdom and commits to foolhardy strategies that ultimately lead <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to the destruction of his kingdom</span>.

This was explained in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars Legends</a></em>: He once served in the Clone Wars and was willing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">senselessly sacrifice hundreds of clones and Jedi to win</a>, and when things start to go south, he would surrender to save his own skin.

He orders an entire fighter squadron away from providing close air support during a major battle to uselessly chase after the <em>Millennium Falcon</em>, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">wastes a massive barrage of firepower to try and kill one guy</a>, which doesn't even work because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Luke wasn't there, just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AstralProjection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AstralProjection">Astral Projecting</a>.</span> A visibly disgusted General Hux has to countermand him right in front of the troops and yell at the gunners to stop blasting a patch of ground.

</li><li> Also in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi">The Last Jedi</a></em>, this is Zigzagged with Vice Admiral Holdo. Her plan to evacuate to an abandoned base is a sound idea yet her leadership has hampered its execution. She refuses to reassure the crew of her ship despite morale being at an all-time low and her refusal to disclose her plan to Poe Dameron ultimately leads to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">mutiny</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">Even if she is right that Poe Dameron is a loose cannon for disobeying orders and challenging her authority</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">one has to wonder why she didn't throw him in the brig or taken any form of disciplinary action</a>.

The heroes occasionally work to keep him in charge, but are hamstrung by the "stealth" aspect.

Later however she plays this straight when the Council makes the frankly <em>harebrained</em> decision to keep Visser Three in charge on Earth and send Visser One off to the new Anati galaxy.

The aforementioned Tacticus is seen as an example of how dangerous a truly intelligent general can be, as he eventually became the duke of a rival city and ended up declaring war on Ankh-Morpork itself and caused the downfall of its empire.

<ul><li> Most of Solarian League Navy's brass falls under this trope. Many of them only hold high rank due to high-level connections (either as members of naval "dynasties" or through family ties to major defense/industrial contractors), and are arrogant enough to believe that, despite the League having had no major combat experience in <em>centuries</em>, that they know everything there is to know about fighting a space war.

The SLN's flag officers who didn't get their positions through outright nepotism or political maneuvering held their positions through accumulating sufficient seniority rather than any actual talent other than keeping their noses clean.

The rescued officers brush him off, claiming that no one cares what the politicians want. Some of the, though, point out that they've spent years (or decades) in captivity and have no idea on the current state of affairs.

While his predecessor, Kur'talos Ravencrest, was an experienced general (if a bit too political for his own good), Stareye was incompetent and only got to a commanding position due to his status as a nobleman. He hated non-elves and relegated tauren, furbolg, and earthen (proto-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame">dwarves</a>) to support roles, despite them being at their best on the front lines. He also refused to listen to Rhonin, Broxigar, and Krasus, despite the latter posing as an elf, even though all of them have plenty of experience fighting the Burning Legion. His "grand" battle plan involved the combined army marching at the enemy in a staggered formation, whose "tips" were supposed to break through the enemy lines. While this worked at first, this was revealed to be a trap, resulting in many casualties, including Stareye himself. After his death, the lowborn Jarod Shadowsong took command and proved to be at least as (if not more) competent as Ravencrest.

</li><li> The unnamed general at Yonkers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorldWarZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorldWarZ">World War Z</a></em> bungles just about every aspect of the battle, having his soldiers dig out massive Cold War-stype static defenses in the middle of a road, vastly underestimating the scope of the zombie horde, and basically squandering his fairly impressive firepower while not actually providing them with enough ammo to wipe the enemy out. Even the soldiers on the ground can look around and see the massive swathes of cover or favorable terrain that they aren't making use of, presumably because simply having the brigade camp out on a roof and gun down the zombies at their leisure wouldn't be glamorous enough.

<ul><li> Rather than brokering his supreme naval power in the west into the wealth and land his people need by supporting one of the powerful factions, Balon Greyjoy decides to pay the iron price and conquer lands he cannot hope to hold. Due to the Ironborn's inferior numbers, inferior training for fighting on land, and difficulty in supplying and reinforcing their troops the further inland they go, this ends with spectacular failure. Only the faction he invades spares him a second thought and even they do not divert forces from their main campaign. In Season 6, Yara calls him out on how all of his plans for the Ironborn have ended in ruin for them.
<ul><li> Balon's son Theon doubles down on this by sneakily capturing Winterfell with only a few men. However, as is pointed out to him, he is too far away from the coast for resupply and reinforcements and holding a city that gives the Greyjoys little of strategic value.
</li></ul></li><li> Edmure Tully has a good eye for individual battles but fails to grasp larger strategies, such as when he defeats Gregor Clegane but in the process drives him out of a trap Robb was preparing.
</li><li> Robb Stark makes a few errors that ends with him being short on manpower which logistically dooms him and his attempts to recruit more men fail spectacularly at the Twins. He also gives orders that lack vital information, like not to engage Gregor Clegane because he's setting a trap.
</li><li> Tyrion Lannister becomes this trope in Season 7, when his strategy for Daenerys' conquest of Westeros backfires catastrophically almost immediately leading to most of her allies and forces being captured or killed  which severely strains Daenerys' trust in him (but luckily not enough to sack him). To be fair it's not entirely his fault. He had been away from Westeros for nearly two years and the intel he based his strategy off of was outdated  and none of Daenerys' Westerosi allies felt like correcting him, even as he explained his strategy right in front of them. His scheme to broke a truce with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">Cersei</a> by bringing a wight from the North to convince her of the threat the White Walkers represent led to one of Daenerys' dragons being killed and revived as a wight by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Night King</a> (partially because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Jon Snow's attempt to kill the Night King</a> delaying their escape), who proceeded to use it to breach the wall. To make matters worse, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether">Cersei refuses to lend them any aid</a> which rendered the whole plan useless and accelerated the White Walkers' invasion into Westeros. It's also muddled because the main things he failed to anticipate were absurd plot contrivances like "the Ironborn will somehow build a new fleet bigger than any in the world in a matter of months that can remain completely undetected until attacking and somehow operate in full strength in every theatre at once" which it's hard to blame him for.
</li><li> Ser Stafford Lannister, as with most Lannister commanders not named Tywin. Even though the Lannister forces had surrounding Oxcross completely under lockdown, they failed to account for the Stark direwolves, allowing Robb to get the jump on him and his men with the help of Grey Wind. In the books, Tyrion thinks very little of his uncle, and most are well aware that his son Daven would make a far better commander.

<ul><li> Colonel Klink is an example where the good guys <em>are</em> going out of their way to keep the idiot in charge. Interestingly, this was at the insistence of Klink's actor, Werner Klemperer. Klemperer's Jewish family fled Germany during the Third Reich, and he later enlisted in the American army to help fight in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. He consented to play Klink only on the condition that Hogan and company would always win the day and that Klink was portrayed as a complete idiot rather than a competent Nazi who's simply outplayed by the heroes. This did vary depending on the episode; sometimes he's just an idiot, sometimes he's aware of what they're doing but pretends not to, and a few times he's actively against the Nazi regime himself.

The man can't even break out of jail — in his first appearance he mentions having made <em>eleven attempts</em> over the course of less than a year and having been caught every time (so Hogan is pretty concerned about his bungling putting his men on worse Stalag facilities, shot, or their operations exposed).

<ul><li> Colonel Flagg. Not exactly a "villain," but a certainly an "antagonist" who always fails in his "intelligence" missions. His first appearance has him break his own arm so he can infiltrate the 4077th — a hospital unit with no intelligence issues to be found. He mentions later on that even <em>he</em> doesn't know what the truth is (so nobody can get it out of him), because he's so paranoid that he keeps himself in a state of total confusion.
</li><li> General Steele attempts to be a frugal leader by ordering the hospital moved directly to the front lines (when they are already close enough to get shelled by both sides) to cut down on fuel consumption. He's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneAdmiral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneAdmiral">bat-shit crazy</a>, and it comes to a head when he attempts to have Hawkeye court-martialed for air-lifting a patient to Seoul when he wanted to use that chopper to observe the unit's move, then starts singing and dancing in the middle of the trial. Notably, the other character Steele's actor played later in the show was the unit's CO Colonel Potter, who was very much <em>not</em> this trope.

<ul><li> The franchise features more than a few Imperial generals who fit this description, officers who got their ranks through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueBlood">family connections</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmchairMilitary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmchairMilitary">have never been in actual combat</a>. Their strategies tend to center around the fact that the Imperial Guard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">has a lot of men in it</a>, and if you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">throw enough of them at the enemy you'll eventually win</a>. Some generals even manage to screw <em>that</em> up. This is brought into even sharper relief by a few examples of pragmatic, tactically solid military leadership, for instance Lord General Zyvan of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain">Ciaphas Cain</a></em> series, who once actively <em>avoided</em> picking a fight with the Tau because the crappy backwater planet they were on wasn't worth the effort, and is quite good at putting limited resources where they can do the most good.
<ul><li> The sixth edition Imperial Guard codex suggests that particularly incompetent commanders eventually wind up meeting a Commissar's bolt round, no matter their social rank.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> occurs when you realize that the only reason the PDF is worse, is because the Imperial Guard took all the competent commanders and soldiers, since it's common knowledge that sending a sub-par tithe of men or materials will get the Imperial Governor a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">visit from the Adeptes Arbites</a>.

His primary strategies included ignoring the massive Ork ship overhead and every single portent foretelling disaster, refusing to inform the rest of the Imperium so he could handle the Orks himself, banishing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass">Commissar Yarrick</a> when he did, breaking up his forces and sending them in bite-sized chunks against a foe who outnumbered them considerably, proclaiming that the Orks couldn't get through Armageddon's jungle (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">which they did in two days</a>), sending in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Titan Legion</a> with absolutely no combined-arms support, and pinning all his hopes on a bunch of ancient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomsdayDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomsdayDevice">Doomsday Devices</a> that turned out to be centuries past their expiration date.

The rest is history.
</li></ul></li><li> Canonically, Abaddon the Despoiler is one of the most feared figures in the galaxy, an unstoppable warrior with the willpower to unite the factions of Chaos into devastating Black Crusades, a psychopathic champion of the Dark Gods who has put off his own ascension to daemonhood just so he can continue to slaughter Imperials in the mortal realm. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">Fanonically</a> he's an incompetent halfwit (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">with no arms</a>) who finds ways to lose despite having billions of followers, the support of all four Chaos Gods, and ten thousand years to plan and execute his schemes. The main excuse for Abaddon's lack of success (besides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a>) is the fact that the Imperium has spent ten thousand years fortifying the passage out of his base in the Eye of Terror, and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">willing to throw any number of soldiers at him</a> until he's forced to retreat. Other sources point out that Abaddon's Black Crusades are typically built around an objective such as swiping an insanely potent daemon sword or the Blackstone Fortresses, while the most recent codex suggests that Abaddon's plan is simply to cause so much carnage in the material universe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace">the Warp</a> spills over and vomits out hordes of daemons, allowing him to overrun Terra. Which still doesn't make much sense.
<ul><li> Abaddon's stats in the game actually support this interpretation, oddly. He's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">an absolute BEAST in close-quarters combat</a> and can kill pretty much anything outside of Apocalypse units in two turns tops. However, he also has pretty much nothing in the way of supporting his army, which is pretty abnormal for a commander character. This means that while Abaddon is a mighty warrior, he can't actually help his army win in any way other than killing lots of enemies with his own hands. Compare to his usual opposite number, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass">Creed</a>, who actually does get rather potent abilities to represent his prowess as a commander (including being able to hide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Warhound Titans</a> behind bushes).
</li><li> Part of the problem is that the status quo of the setting (bar a few years where they moved it forward and retconned it back not long after) is "Abaddon has begun to attack the Cadian Gate with a colossal army." However, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a>, the setting refuses to actually show the intended outcome — namely, Abaddon's trillions of soldiers swamping the Cadian Gate and conquering it in short order. Therefore, Abaddon has been stuck in this early phase for most of the game's history, leaving fans with the impression that Abaddon has spent twenty-odd years failing to breach the defenses of one planet.
</li><li> When the setting timeline was finally moved forward it was established that in-universe Cadia really did hold out for over a decade... and even then the planet itself broke before the defenders did. This unleashed a massive warp storm to tear the heart out of the Imperium... which <em>missed</em>. While it caused destruction on an unimaginable scale and divided the galaxy in two, it was <em>supposed</em> to go in an entirely different direction and destroy Terra itself. Abaddon quietly disappeared from the story at that point. Amusingly, the edition that brought this victory actually updated Abaddon's aforementioned non-supportive statline, giving him actual support options for his army rather than just serving as a foe-mulcher, which might explain the victories he actually got.
</li><li> Other Chaos champions get to deal with fickle patrons who will abandon them regardless of their battlefield successes. After all, Tzeentch is literally the god of backstabbing, while Khorne doesn't care which side gets slaughtered so long as blood has been spilled.
</li></ul></li><li> Ork Warbosses in general. Ironically, those of them who have some degree of tactical insight tend to fare worse as they are only used to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">highlight</a> how mighty defenders of the Imperium are. The worst example is Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka, the largest and smartest of all orks, prophet of Gork and Mork on the task to reunite the ork race. Somehow he is a galactic threat despite losing every major battle whenever Space Marines or a certain old man with silly hat and an oversized powerclaw are involved. Luckily, right now (7th ed) he shook off Black Templars pursuit and joined war in Octarius Sector. He seems to have far better luck fighting Tyranids.
<ul><li> And he's <em>the smartest Warboss in Ork history</em>. The vast majority of Warbosses, if they do end up using tactical smarts, still follow the tried-and-true Ork tactic of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">throwing literally anything and everything</a> they have at their opponent, ignoring casualties or sensible strategies. Warbosses are more of organizers rather than leaders. Moments of tactical/strategical acumen coming from Ork Warbosses are quite rare, and tend to result in massive casualties for the non-Ork because <em>no-one</em> expects it.
</li><li> When he got his own codex it was revealed/retconned that his actual goals aren't to win his wars outright, but to create ever-growing perpetual meatgrinders that drive the tribes to war under his banner on a galactic scale. Armageddon is one, Octarius is now a second after he tipped the balance against the 'nids, and he's now traveling the galaxy trying to set up more.

Authors seems to notice this and now Eldar warhosts are more frequently led by Warlocks (seers that do have military training) or Autarchs (actual generals) with Farseer filling an adviser role.
</li><li> Pretty much the only races to not have any standout examples are the Tau and the Tyranids (unless you count the Swarmlord, whose developed a stigma of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">nerfed</a> into uselessness"). Good for the Tau because given the tiny size of their empire compared to everyone else, this is presumably the only reason why it's lasted so long.

<ul><li> The Tau's "Greater Good" philosophy is utterly alien to humans, because the Tau actually will fall back and stop contesting an objective if it becomes obvious the resources tied up could be put to better use elsewhere, because while every Tau is ready to sacrifice himself for the, well, Greater Good, Tau commanders look for strategies that involve minimal loss of life for their army (and in fact, glorious last stands are kind of looked down on among the Tau, because a commander who let the situation degrade so badly without evacuating clearly wasn't that much of a commander.

He scored a few victories over the years through things like getting lost and accidentally stumbling into the enemy's HQ. He was eventually "promoted" to a prestigious but meaningless position with the idea that he'd just stay there until he retired, but then the Word of Blake Jihad broke out and he scored an accidental victory against Blakist elements who were attacking the factory on his planet. This led to him being declared "Hero of the Commonwealth" for propaganda reasons, and unfortunately ended up getting him reassigned back to active military duty. Due to this, he was eventually given command of one of the forces that Stone's Coalition invaded Terra with, where his bungling caused the accidental destruction of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowAwayCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowAwayCountry">Singapore</a>.
</li><li> Entirely too many high-ranking officers and Warlords of the Draconis Combine have shown similar tendencies for the Dragon's comfort. In their case, the root cause tends to be a mix of ambition, obsession with martial glory, and the Combine's take on <em>bushido</em>, and one major example where it comes back to repeatedly bite them is the initial Clan Invasion, during which tradition- and hidebound commanders lead their troops into "glorious" and "honorable" attacks against the Clans on multiple occasions only for the latter's familiarity with very much the same approach to warfare and formidable technological edge to promptly turn those encounters into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb Stomp Battles</a>.
</li><li> Clan generals have the same tendencies as the above Combine example. For centuries, Clan society focused around the gaining of honour through fair-minded, minimal-waste engagements fought entirely on the tactical level. High-ranking commanders in Clan society tended to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">those who could kick the most ass inside a 'mech cockpit</a>, not those <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist">who could lead two hundred 'mechs to victory in a large battle</a>, or prepare the logistics needed to use those 'mechs to take a dozen worlds. Thus, when the time came to invade the gigantic Inner Sphere, the Clan leaders (with two exceptions) proved unable to think of the invasion in strategic terms and treated the whole thing as they would any inter-Clan struggle, bidding down their armies and engaging the Inner Sphere in "fair" fights to obtain maximum honour for each warrior. Despite the element of surprise, the Inner Sphere being weakened by civil war, and superior infantry and BattleMechs, the Clans failed to capture less than a fifth of the Inner Sphere before the invasion ground to a halt. This got so bad that when Khan Ulric of the Wolf Clan (one of the two aforementioned exceptions) kept on moving his front lines because he'd actually prepared for fighting the Inner Sphere, the other Khans accused him of cheating.
</li><li> Clan Ice Hellion is infamous for their tactics which can be summarized as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">Attack! Attack! Attack!</a>. Their commanders favor speed over everything else, as such they field light and medium mechs, against opponents who like fielding larger and more heavily armed Omnimechs. The worse example is Khan Raina Montose, who led the disastrous invasion on Clan Jade Falcon's occupation zone, which resulted in the former Clan's destruction.

Thrakhath's failure ultimately leads to the destruction of Kilrah and the utter defeat of the Empire.

As a result, in game he wins precisely one battle, over Tarsonis, a planet whose defenses he already knows inside and out. Other then that, he gets spanked by Raynor's Raiders in their escape from the Dominion, he gets thrashed by the Zerg on Char, he gets a fleet vaporized by the Protoss under Tassadar, he gets <em>another</em> fleet wiped out by the UED, he gets thrashed by the UED once more on Korhal, and at last Kerrigan mercifully wipes him and his men out in a surprise attack after the UED have been driven off Korhal again.

<ul><li> General Lee Oliver, or "General Wait-And-See" as many of his troops call him. According to Boone, he received his position because he's friends with President Kimball. His strategy (or "Tunnel Vision" as Mr. House calls it) to defend Hoover Dam from Caesar's Legion consists of one glorious slaughterhouse on the dam, in an effort to overshadow Ranger Chief Hanlon's more tactically nuanced defense of the dam four years earlier. This means his only tactic is to mass troops on the Dam, leaving other territories and bases deeply undermanned and open to the Legion's attacks. It's actually possible to convince Lanius, the opposing commander, to back down on the basis that the defenses before him have been placed so incompetently and the battle so easy that it has to be a trap, like with Joshua years earlier. It's not a trap; Oliver's just that dumb.
</li><li> While considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">Memetic Badass</a> (both in-universe and by the players), Joshua Graham was stated to be neither tactically flexible nor strategically brilliant, and by his own admission is not one for logistics, who mostly got by because he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a> who mostly faced off against tribals and raiders. When up against actual tacticians like Hanlon leading a sizable and more technologically advanced force, he ends up charging his army into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefensiveFeintTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefensiveFeintTrap">Defensive Feint Trap</a>.
</li><li> The other Legate, Lanius, isn't exactly the best of generals either. Joshua himself says he's not interested in leading anyone except in battle, and true enough, he's a fairly decent tactician in the middle of an actual fight. In terms of strategy, however, he has no idea what he's doing but keeps on charging anyways because his endless thirst for blood keeps him going, and he's far too brutal on both his legion and everyone else to really command an army for any length of time beyond the first battle. The Legion <em>will</em> collapse if he's left in charge, by a combination of mismanagement, bad logistics, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">taking his own mistakes out on his legionnaires</a> and him constantly picking fights he can only win <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">Pyrrhically</a>, or not at all (he is the <em>only</em> one stupid enough to think he can and should pick a fight with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndefeatableLittleVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndefeatableLittleVillage">the Boomers</a>, for example, and will take absurd casualties wiping them out).
</li><li> Father Elijah, the former Elder of the Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel, ordered his chapter to hold a power plant against the NCR, despite being vastly outnumbered, simply for the sole purpose of trying to find a hidden superweapon of some sorts. His tactical incompetence is primarily because he was not trained as a Knight or Paladin (being a Scribe who was promoted for his technological genius) and because he was also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">Control Freak</a> with no regard for human life.
</li><li> His successor, Elder McNamara, isn't much of an improvement, keeping the Brotherhood's bunker locked down after the aforementioned disastrous battle Elijah got them into. His rigid insistence on following outdated protocols means that most of the Brotherhood's troops have never seen real combat, their numbers are dwindling with no new blood being brought in, and there are only a handful of Brotherhood members allowed outside. All but four of the members outside the bunker (three scouts and a black-sheep member of the order that you can recruit as a companion) wind up dead by the time you find them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">His second-in-command recognizes these issues and wants to relieve him of command as a result.</a>

His primary method of spreading the glory of Sparta is by slaughtering cities, and ended up nearly dying and losing most of that army because he faced off against a numerically superior foe in open terrain, which is especially ironic given the primary source of Spartan combat fame.

He constantly disregards intel gathered by agents (especially Ghosts) and then blames them when things turn sour. The guy's most famous victory against the Gorgs was mostly due to the element of surprise, as the Gorgs were expecting to fight the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist">Vardrags</a> and have never even seen a human before. His officers call him "the Rhino" behind his back due to his complete reliance on direct frontal attacks and apparent ignorance of any other tactics. Despite losing his flagship many times, Norbank always seems to survive. Luckily, in one of a later missions, you have the option of <em>not</em> saving him from a derelict ship without being penalized in any way.

However, his grand plan for stopping <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorde">The Horde</a> is a simple flanking maneuver that doesn't work on creatures that they're facing (who will never break and run, who have no regard for their own losses, and who can only be defeated entirely by killing their commander who hadn't even been sighted) and involves putting the king and all of their most valuable men on the front lines (Loghain repeatedly protested the king's presence on the field, but he insisted).

The sequel ups his status as this trope by him promoting an attractive woman to the rank of captain, even though it's clear she has no idea what command is.

After Megatron is pounded into slag by the mighty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Metroplex</a>, Starscream immediately assumes leadership of the Decepticons (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">like you expected anything else</a>). From there, a plan to steal Energon from the Autobots goes horribly awry when he attacks the transport lugging the Energon with a force consisting solely of aircraft, when the majority of onboard weapons is <em>anti-air batteries</em>. The Combaticons warn him about this, but he doesn't listen until it's too late.
<ul><li> It gets better. The Combaticons are able to salvage the operation to steal the energon, managing to secure (read: prevent the loss of) half the load of energon. But to do this they had to ignore Starscream's order to retreat. How does Starscream react to this miracle his side desperately needs? He arrests the Combaticons for treason. Of course then Megatron returns...

The only instance when he shows anything resembling advanced tactics is when he attempts a sneak attack on a keep by burrowing his forces through the foundations... which he then screws up by sending the hero a telepathic message, gloating about his impending victory.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stronghold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stronghold">Stronghold</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Rat, formally known as Duc de Puce, is a prime example. One of the five main antagonists of the game, Duc de Puce fancies himself as an imperial conqueror, forging his mighty empire throughout the remnants of the player's father's kingdom. Born into nobility, he is extremely arrogant and extremely sure of himself and his troops, and is unafraid to use dirty tricks and scheming to win the day... Except he <em>never</em> wins the day. He's also an extremely cowardly, easily-panicked, grovelling wimp with no semblance of actual tactical or strategic skill. How he got accepted into the ranks of his much more intimidating and competent allies, and how his troops even obey his often-suicidal orders, is a complete mystery, which the best theory being "because The Snake sees a useful pawn in him". He's actually somewhat aware of this himself; after his first few attacks fail (one only because The Snake double crossed him) he decides to reinforce his own strongholds and call for aid from his "allies", only for them to refuse and intimidate him into wasting so many men in futile attacks that his own castle is left critically undermanned in his last stand.
</li><li> Another one of the enemies of Stronghold, Duc Truffle, "The Pig", is a less-notable example. While he has a love of combat and violence and is not at all cowardly, he's an incredibly dimwitted glutton and usually lets his commanders and the other Ducs do the thinking for him. What he does have is lots of money, lots of food, and a very well-fed, well-trained army that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer">relies solely on brute force and numerical superiority to accomplish its objectives</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Taiidan Emperor of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld">Homeworld</a></em> truly lives up to this title. Characterized by his extraordinary corruption and paranoia, the Emperor maintained law and order over his people across the galaxy through sheer military might, resorting to brutal and insane tactics to put down anything he perceived as a threat to his own power in the Empire, which only sowed dissent among his people who grew disillusioned with the regime. When informed that the descendants of the defeated Hiigaran Empire, the Kushan, had established hyperspace technology and intended to seek out their former homeworld which now serves as the seat of Imperial power, the Emperor brazenly launches a major assault on the Kushan's home planet to ensure the destruction of their race. He then boasts of the fleet's success to the Empire, which instead triggers a determined rebellion within the Taiidan ranks against their leaders, in turn fueling the Kushan Fleet's fight against the Empire. Subsequent efforts to massacre sympathizers of the rebellion along with the peaceful Bentusi who aided the Kushan quickly turns the entire galaxy against the Emperor, all while his many fleets face a series of devastating defeats at the hands of the Kushan and their rebel allies. Ultimately, his own paranoia serves to unravel his empire as his actions trigger a brief but massive war that sees the destruction of his armada and ultimately himself as he oversees the Empire's last stand, leading to the dissolution of the old regime and his enemy's reclamation of their long-lost world.

Many times throughout the story, the general gets called out time and again for having the militia clean up the messes he created, or being used as scapegoats, and do the hard work that the army could very easily overpower through numbers. How he managed to get his position is eventually explained in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles4">Valkyria Chronicles 4</a></em>; pretty much every Gallian who wants to actually fight is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EagleSquadron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EagleSquadron">doing so under a foreign flag</a> by the time Gallia is actually invaded, leaving the politically-motivated top brass are suddenly risking actual lives, highlighting existing problems with the system. Damon's behavior in particular is cited as a motivating factor for the Gallian rebels in the second game.
</li><li> Warchief Grom Hellscream in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> never shows any real tactics beyond <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a> and calling his opponents cowards as he flees to his final stronghold. Notably, by the end of the first patch of <em>Warlords of Draenor</em>, Gul'dan calls him out on promising conquest but bringing only failure, having lost almost all of his lieutenants and most of his forces in general, before overthrowing Grom.

Olaf and Kanbei in the first game have most of the traits, fond of grandiose plans, poor alliances, and laughable tactics (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionPromotion">though they get better in the second game</a>). They get replaced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">Flak</a>, who loudly announces his tactics (often by shouting them across the battlefield) and has little in those tactics besides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a>. And Greyfield in <em>Days of Ruin</em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeidermeyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeidermeyer">The Neidermeyer</a> par excellence, often micromanaging his commanders, adding unnecessary objectives, or giving orders that are either impossible or morally repugnant.
</li><li> Sir Daniel Fortesque of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Medievil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Medievil">Medievil</a></em>. A knight who gained a prominent position in the royal court of Gallowmere by lying about grand feats of valour he never actually performed, and ended up leading the kingdom's army when the evil necromancer Zarok arose to ravage the land. He was the first casualty of the entire battle, killed ignominiously via arrow-induced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">Eye Scream</a>, and his second-in-command, a mere boy, had to take over and win the battle for him. The King cooked up a story about how he died performing a noble <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> and hastily buried him to try and save face. A century later Zarok rises again and Dan, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemBones">sans his flesh</a>, has to bring him down and this time earn his place as a great hero.

Especially noteworthy is her attempt to juice up her Servants on Mad Enhancement, which turned them all into crazed warriors that could barely work together or follow orders and actually weakened some of them. Later appearances by her realized the above and decided to just run with the interpretation of her as a loudmouthed and dimwitted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain">Harmless Villain</a>.

His adherence to said code also means that he gets deeply upset when Jin begins to rely on "dishonorable" tactics that are actually effective, ranging from stealth to poisoning enemy food supplies.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> has this trope's former page image: Zapp Brannigan. He's not evil, per se, but he's usually against the protagonists due to his own total incompetence, aggressiveness, and stupidity. His deeds have included fighting the Killbots by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">sacrificing millions of soldiers until the Killbots reached their limit and shut down</a>, attacking the Hubble Space Telescope, ordering his ships to make a run so as to clog the enemy ship weapons with their own wreckage, destroying an entire repair station due to impatience, destroying the brand new headquarters of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">The Federation</a> by using his ships' laser at full power to cut the inauguration ribbon, attacking a strategically unimportant planet for no reason and wasting the element of surprise by dumping his soldiers out through the ship's floor, getting enough women killed through fraternization that the army banned them from his command, declaring war on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidNeutral">the Neutral Planet</a>, commanding a space battle while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmchairMilitary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmchairMilitary">looking out a restaurant window</a>, losing a conflict <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser">where he had a space battleship to cavemen,</a> and trying to get the protagonists arrested or killed multiple times, even when they were either helping him or the only ones capable of solving the problem. He has won offscreen victories (against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnedByFaintPraise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnedByFaintPraise">Pacifists of the Gandhi Nebula,</a> for instance), and taken credit for other people's deeds, however, so he keeps his job, and is even well-regarded by many.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeagueUnlimited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeagueUnlimited">Justice League Unlimited</a></em>, Gorilla Grodd takes control of the rag-tag band of villains who've organized themselves. They commit daring crimes under his leadership, to support his ultimate plan... which turns out to be turning the entire population of the world into apes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a>'s response is to shoot him. After Luthor is given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">Klingon Promotion</a>, Sinestro sarcastically suggests to Luthor that he should make the world go bald for their next evil scheme. This is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">the Silver Age</a>, where comic book villains were fond of grandiose, nonsensical schemes for altering the world to their liking. Grodd was portrayed as a competent leader, except for the whole "turn the world into apes" thing.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CareBearsAdventuresInCareALot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CareBearsAdventuresInCareALot">Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-Lot</a></em>, in which Grizzle's own robot assistant UR-2 informs him that his frequent failures are mainly his <em>own</em> fault (considering that Grizzle frequently "talks" to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanionCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanionCube">an inanimate "robot" named Mr. Beaks</a>, it's not hard to see why).
</li><li> Megatron in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1">Transformers: Generation 1</a></em>. To be fair, he was often also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurroundedByIdiots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurroundedByIdiots">Surrounded by Idiots</a>, but we're talking about a bad guy who was once defeated by a <em>can of spray paint</em>. And then there's his willingness to keep <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">Starscream</a> around, even though not only was Starscream a traitor but an idiot as well. This is lampshaded in the Marvel Comics version where after Starscream pulls the inevitable backstab. Megatron asks himself why he brought Starscream back to life:
<div class="indent"><strong>Megatron:</strong> Why? That's what they all asked me. Why him... why Starscream? Why, of all Decepticons, did I decide to revitalize the one whose record of deceit and betrayal is legend? Because I'm an <em>idiot</em>, that's why!
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>: Commander/Admiral Zhao is utterly terrible at his job. His list of accomplishments include: Getting beaten up by a teenager, despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongButUnskilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongButUnskilled">"master"</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">firebender,</a> and his opponent still working with the basics. Successfully capturing the Avatar (read: got an elite group of marksmen to do it while he stayed behind) then placing him under a token guard (read: four guys) and gathering the rest of the garrison together so he can make a speech to them about the Fire Nation being superior and how great he is. Setting fire to his own boats because a twelve-year-old was making fun of him. And then there's his <em>Pièce de résistance</em> of dumbassery: Slaughtering the spirit of the moon in a jealous rage, endangering the <em>entire world</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em> has only one soldier under his command — Zim himself — but his plans and general behavior are bang on target with this trope. Examples include:
<ul><li> The one time he was ever given command of anything, he managed to halt an entire galactic invasion singlehandedly by going on a rampage in a gigantic robot <em>without realizing he hadn't left his home planet</em>. Lampshaded mercilessly all the time (Zim's ego just won't let him acknowledge it), but of particular note is the episode when he manages to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">GIR</a> to stay in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Duty Mode</a>. GIR becomes competent enough to realise the primary obstacle to Zim conquering Earth is Zim himself, and subsequently tries to kill him so GIR can do it properly:
<div class="indent"><strong>GIR:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">Your methods are stupid; your progress has been stupid; your intelligence is stupid! For the good of the mission, you must be terminated!</a>
</div></li><li> The episode "Hobo-13" shows that if put in the command of a group of soldiers Zim will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">needlessly sacrifice</a> everyone until he alone succeeds, using them as either bridges to cross a gap (when there's a tree nearby to knock down), using others as bait and even using his last remaining soldier as a battering ram. Needless to say, the Drill Sergeant failed him so hard he got bruises. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then Zim SOMEHOW manages to beat said Drill Sergeant in combat.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> General Specific in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheepInTheBigCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheepInTheBigCity">Sheep in the Big City</a></em>. To put it bluntly, this guy can't even catch one sheep in a city where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">nobody likes sheep</a> for some reason.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ExoSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ExoSquad">Exo Squad</a></em> has Captain Marcus. All of his tactics mostly involve attacking right away with no thought of any battleplans whatsoever. Most of which end in spectacular failure. Also his complete disregard for the use of Exo-Frames in any form. This is especially telling considering the show is about a squad of E-frame pilots.
</li><li> General Pong Krell in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em> is this when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">Played for Drama</a>. His first command is to order his battalion to march through hostile territory along an open road surrounded by trees, to attack a fortified city. They never make it there, because it turns out that the road was covered in landmines. When the commanding clone, Rex, orders a retreat after a withering assault, Krell threatens to remove him from command. He then follows this up by making no attempts at reconnaissance against an enemy with completely unfamiliar technology, forcing exhausted soldiers on multi-day marches, ordering valuable special forces units to the front lines, leading from the rear instead of using his Jedi powers to fight alongside them (sowing disrespect and low morale in his men in the process), making his troopers travel through a narrow gorge to attack a base defended by heavy enemy tanks and aircraft, insulting and belittling the clones with regular bigoted remarks, planning to launch a full forward assault on a city protected by long-range missiles, and court-martialing soldiers for disobeying his orders, even though their disobedience brought their side a crucial victory and saved thousands of lives. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, this is 100% deliberate on his part; he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>, and actively doing everything in his power to sabotage his own side with his command style</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GIJoeARealAmericanHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GIJoeARealAmericanHero">G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero</a></em>:
<ul><li> Cobra Commander, at least in the cartoons. He's prone to overconfidence, often leading to his forces getting needlessly destroyed when a tactical retreat would've been more prudent, and then afterwards blaming everyone else before himself for his mistakes. His list of accomplishments includes being defeated by a group of schoolchildren in the DiC run.
</li><li> Serpentor, in the cartoons, is noted to be even worse at this. He can snatch defeat out of the jaws of victory. To date, he has launched an armed invasion of Washington DC, crowning himself the king of a "1000 year reign" but makes absolutely zero preparations to hold on to the advantage he gained by the element of surprise and is deposed <em>in less than an hour</em> because he never dreamed the "gift-giving" dignitaries would carry firearms in their briefcases, having to be rescued by Cobra Commander. He leads an armed attack on Joe Island when the command structure had been screwed over by his lieutenants, but is quickly handed his backside when the Joes manage to reassert the proper chain of command. He also never has any exit strategies in place for when things start going south, often refusing to retreat until massive losses force him to do so. In fact, Cobra has to seek refuge in Cobra-la during <em>GI Joe: The Animated Movie</em>, because Serpentor had led one crushing defeat after another until Cobra had nothing left.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GetBlake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GetBlake">Get Blake!</a></em>: The Squallien General is a complete failure as a military commander. His tendency to dismiss Leonard's plans in favour of those of his two idiot nephews is one reason why the Squalliens have repeatedly failed to get Blake.
</li><li> Emerald in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> is one of the highest-ranked Gems in Homeworld's hierarchy... yet she keeps getting outwitted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">societal outcasts with no combat training</a>, and she refuses to step up her game because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities">she doesn't want to damage the ship they have in their possession</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>, Spitfire's inability to control her troops and needing to be reminded of basic morals by a newly recruited subordinate in "Wonderbolts Academy", along with the Wonderbolts general <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitariesAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitariesAreUseless">ineptness at their jobs</a>, makes it quite clear she's a poor at best commander. Though initially unintentional, the scene in "The Washouts" of her unironically emulating <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/SaturdayNightLive">Matt Foley</a></em> complete with shaking Scootaloo by the neck to scare the kid straight (and failing miserably) make it clear the writers are acknowledging she's not nearly as good a commander as she's cracked up to be. It's revealed in <em>Friends Forever 11</em> that Spitfire's only method for leading is to shout and criticize her recruits, and when she can't do that (like say, because it's a pack of kids), she has no idea how to command and completely loses her nerve. Rainbow lampshades "everypony's got a few flaws" when Spitfire expresses her regret at having this problem. She also reveals she initially didn't <em>want</em> to leader the Wonderbolts, because leadership sounded boring — she just found out she was good at it via her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">Drill Sergeant Nasty</a> routine, and she sticks to that because it's all she knows.
