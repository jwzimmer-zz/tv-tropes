In video games with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGElements" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGElements">RPG Elements</a>, not to mention <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPG">RPGs</a> themselves, there are often locations that are prime for quickly gathering experience (and, rarely, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyGrinding">other</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemFarming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemFarming">resources</a>). This can be due to a number of factors:
</p><p></p><ul><li> Enemies well beyond what you should be meeting, with commensurate awards, are available - particularly if near a source of healing (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavePoint">Save Point</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInn">Trauma Inn</a>, or the like).
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">Guest-Star Party Member</a> has joined you and gives you enough power to overwhelm what you ordinarily can't handle.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><li> An area so overloaded with various types of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime">Metal Slime</a> that you're bound to take out a couple by attrition alone.
</li><li> It's extraordinarily easy to take advantage of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">Elemental RockPaperScissors</a> in this area.
</li><li> Otherwise formidable, the local enemies are weak to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor">crippling status debuff</a> that rarely works anywhere else.
</li><li> An area where you can get incredibly useful items, either by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameStealing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameStealing">Video Game Stealing</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrops">Random Drops</a>, or findable in abundance while just walking around.
</li></ul><p>These areas quickly become popular, as players quickly stock up in these locales on experience (and usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneySpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneySpider">money</a>, although that's usually secondary to the main goal). Some of these areas are accessible via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">Sequence Breaking</a>; they were supposed to be standard rewards when encountered, and players have found a shortcut to get to them earlier.

These specific types of areas are very conducive to power leveling, but have one thing in common — after a certain story event, they become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">inaccessible</a>.
</p><p>Due to how popular these become, many attract a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nickname</a> if not explicitly named in the game itself.

Dashing through the area while swinging the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">Rhava Velar</a> then resetting the monsters by leaving through the doorway on the right is one of the quickest ways to accumulate experience, and all the enemies except the giant mortes also drop items that are useful for late-game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting">Item Crafting</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a></em> has a nearly unbeatable enemy located in the Royal Chapel called a Spiked Ball. Despite not being an enemy so much as a piece of weaponry perched on top of a Bone Pillar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">on top of a long set of stairs</a> that just happens to be lying in one particular spot and which does massive amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollisionDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollisionDamage">Collision Damage</a>, you can destroy it if you stand as close as possible to it, equip a fist weapon, and hold the attack button for a minute or two. It's a piece of cake to gain 10 levels in this room if you so desire.
<ul><li> Also, once you reach the inverted castle's Marble Corridor, you encounter the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">Boss in Mook Clothing</a> the Guardians. While ridiculously powerful, their attacks can be easily telegraphed and avoided. Since they are the highest-level non-boss enemies in the game, they fork over absurd amounts of experience when killed, and a drop chance for a decent two-handed sword as well as a rare chance for the best set-stat armor in the game (second only to the Walk Armor when all of both castles are explored).
</li><li> In the first castle, actually the beginning of the first castle, in the Castle Keep. You stand right next to the stairs where the zombies won't reach you, and you can cut down unlimited amounts of zombies, risk free! But it is only 1 exp per zombie so a controller with an auto option is handy. The mermans are handy for this as well, allowing the most patient of gamers to gain 40 levels after a few days of waiting with the PSX on.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaHarmonyOfDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaHarmonyOfDissonance">Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance</a></em> has a room full of skeletons in tanks in Castle A's Skeleton Cavern. These enemies are called Skeleton Glass, and once they burst out of the tank they're not much more dangerous than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoomba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoomba">regular skeletons</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">go down as fast</a>. But their experience drop, while not the best, is pretty high up there.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> series:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeldaIITheAdventureOfLink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeldaIITheAdventureOfLink">Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</a></em> has plenty of good places to grind for experience late in the game, but one of the better ones you can access earlier on is the large prairie across the eastern sea. The Tektites you find there are only vulnerable to the Fire spell, but they give 50 experience points each, go down with a reasonable amount of hits, and every sixth one you kill drops the best goodies; either a red potion or a 200-point XP bag. What's more, the town of Nabooru is just a few paces away, so your life and magic can both be refilled in a snap.
</li><li> Early on, the Skulls in the first dungeon are a great source of experience. They take a little while to kill (50 blows at level 1) but they drop either 50 or 200 XP and are completely immobile while being attacked. You can often get two or three at once to speed things up, then leave the screen to get them to return.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors">Hyrule Warriors</a></em>, the Master Quest adventure map squares with "rack up enemy kills" are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>, you have a set amount of time to murder as much as possible including some bosses, and the game constantly throws magic jars at you to maintain Focus Spirit mode (which, after 40 or 50 kills depending on the character, doubles XP gain) for a very long time. Getting good at these maps can get you around 5-10 levels every go on average depending on whether you have a weapon that increases EXP gained and/or are using the mixture that increases it further, and one of the final squares on the map (the one in the bottom left corner) is both late game and one of these, making it phenomenal for powerlevelling lower leveled warriors.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LEGOStarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LEGOStarWars">LEGO Star Wars</a></em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarWarsTheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarWarsTheForceAwakens">The Force Awakens</a></em> you get to Takodana Castle fairly early on and you can head on over and kill poor Grummgar (the big guy who's girlfriend calls the <em>First Order</em> in the film) for a considerable amount of studs, and since he's not an enemy but an NPC he'll almost immediately respawn. Rinse and repeat, and you will have <em>tons</em> of studs in no time at all even if you're not using any of the Stud Multiplier cheats. Note that this only works until you purchase Grummgar as a playable character, so make sure you have all the money you need before you do.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX1">Mega Man X1</a></em>, right at the beginning of Armored Armadillo's stage, there is a bat enemy that gives an extra life 90% of the time when it dies and respawns indefinitely. You're not supposed to see it though since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinecartMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinecartMadness">you should normally be riding on a minecart at ten times the speed of light</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends">Mega Man Legends</a></em> had small reaverbot enemies called <a class="urllink" href="http://www.legends-station.com/?page=mml1/rvr-miroc">Mirocs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that appeared fairly early in the game, moved slowly, had only a weak physical attack, and died in only a few hits, yet dropped <em>ridiculous</em> Zenny (the game's currency) for that point in the game. In about an hour of gameplay you could farm enough money from them to fully upgrade the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">Machine Buster arm</a>, which became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiskOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiskOneNuke">Disk One Nuke</a> for most of the game that tears most bosses apart in <em>minutes</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends">Mega Man Legends</a> 2</em>, there is a single enemy in the B-class ruins that drops 10,000 Zenny per kill with an S License, can be killed with a single throw from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeItem">Lifter</a>, and, unlike almost all other enemies in the game, respawns when you leave and come back to the room it's in. Because doing this can net a skilled player equipped with a fully-upgraded Vacuum Arm around 50,000 Zenny per <em>minute</em>, money grinding this guy for an hour or two will allow you to upgrade most of your weapons to a point where the rest of the game becomes trivial at best.
<ul><li> In the Manda Ruins early on in the game you will meet clamp like enemies in a long corridor who shoot at you, if you have the Rocket Launcher they fall easily and drop decent loot in addition to energy for the weapon. They also respawn like the above example.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sundered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sundered">Sundered</a></em>, each of the three regions has areas designated as Endless Hordes zones, where the player character will be constantly attacked by endlessly-spawning enemies until she leaves the zone. A player who can make it from one end of an Endless Hordes zone to the other will rack up a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints">Shards</a> from killing enemies, and may be rewarded with a Perk at the far exit.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ys">Ys</a> III</em> players will pass through a courtyard in the Ilvern Ruins where Fazul, owl-like monsters, continuously dive at you from the skies. In this game, you can hold Up + Attack to rapidly stab above Adol's head and skewer these enemies in groups. Damage is unavoidable, but with the Power Ring active, you'll earn levels and money at a breakneck pace. Just remember to save enough health (or a cheap healing herb) to escape afterward. Did we mention this is the <em>second</em> area in the game?
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Card Battle Game </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearAcid2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearAcid2">Metal Gear Acid 2</a></em> there is a short level atop a moving train with only a handful of robot opponents. Using Stinger/FIM type weapons, you can attack these opponents even at the far end of the level, taking the target and any of the robots on the immediate squares out in one shot. This means you can complete the level in about three moves with the robots not even getting a turn. This makes the level very good for grinding for new cards.
<ul><li> The Arena Mode also qualifies, since it rotates only a handful of bosses (Liquid Snake, Revolver Ocelot, Vamp, Fortune, The End, The Boss, Teliko and Venus), each of whom have very predicable AI and strategy even on Hard and Extreme mode (with Venus, you even know the contents of her hand at all times). Once you've learned these and built a deck to fit around them, you can beat even Extreme mode characters with minimal effort, way before your characters should be able to, and grind for cards while raking in the points. And there's no penalty for losing.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YugiohTheSacredCards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YugiohTheSacredCards">Yugioh The Sacred Cards</a></em>, The easiest way to get your level up quickly in the final levels is to stack your deck with Shadow and Fiend monsters when it comes time to duel Ishizu, curbstomp her Light and Dream monsters for 30 deck points and a rare card, then lose to Kaiba on purpose. When you return to the museum you have to start over with Ishizu again, giving you 30 deck points each time.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YuGiOhGXSpiritCaller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YuGiOhGXSpiritCaller">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX: Spirit Caller</a></em> you're normally forced to return to your dorm after nightfall, but during story events you can stay out as long as you don't complete the event. This allows you as much time as you want to level grind, collect spirits, etc.

<ul><li> Even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy">Dissidia Final Fantasy</a></em> has one of these; the Exdeath Trick. Equip a character with as many EXP boosting accessories as possible and the non-auto summoning Magic Pot summon and fight a level 100 Exdeath in Quick Battle. Due to his poor AI and the effects of the summon (lets you copy opponent's Brave), it's rather easy to beat him, netting you tons of experience.
<ul><li> It's even easier if you fight the Exdeath from the Omega friend card. He uses the Barbariccia summon, which swaps your bravery with his when you use any summon. It's essentially the same trick as with Magic Pot, but with the added benefit of being able to use almost any manual summon and not having to wait for Magic Pot to recharge.
</li><li> And you can get even <em>easier</em> XP once you've unlocked Gabranth (The <em>FFXII</em> character). His special attacks don't do any damage, just make him stand still and charge up his EX gauge. If you set his AI to cautious, he won't attack you directly, so as long as you keep at him, stopping him from charging up his gauge, he won't do any damage to you, even at level 100, at which point you'll be getting up to <strong>80+</strong> levels with the proper bonuses per kill with a low-level character.
</li><li> The ability to create custom rules in <em>Duodecim</em> adds to the fun. By setting the respawn and absorbtion rate of the EX Gauge and EX Cores and equipping "Force to Courage" (which converts all the absorbed EX Force to Bravery), Cores will instantly spawn and you can raise your Bravery to the maximum and possibly killing your opponent in one shot, without the need of Manual Magick Pot.
</li><li> But wait! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">It gets even easier!</a> You can set Bravery Bonus to -100 in Custom Rules, and the game will start awarding total bravery to the lower-leveled character in any fight. Thus if you use adjusted-to-level-1 character against lv 100 character, your bravery will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">start at 9999</a> or close to it! Combine this with impotent characters like Gabranth and "Minimal" A.I., and you'll get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">honest-to-Cosmos</a> max-level character roster in no time! And you can alter PSP system clock so that it's always your Bonus Day, making the progress even faster!

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII">Diablo II</a></em>, the first area of the 5th act in the expansion pack used to be a great place to level grind thanks to relatively easy monsters who gave exp like candy. Pretty sure it got fixed in a patch later on though.
<ul><li> The general peninsulas for <em>Diablo II</em> are something along the lines of:
<ul><li> Tristram for 1-15
</li><li> Tomb runs for 15-20
</li><li> Cow level for 20-25
</li><li> Baal Runs on varying difficulty modes for 25 on.
</li></ul></li><li> Getting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug">Bug Rush</a> to Act 4 in Hell Mode at level 24+ can get you to level 65+ in mere <em>minutes.</em>
</li><li> There's also an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedGlitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedGlitch">Ascended Glitch</a> that lets you equip items to gain stats, which lets you equip even better items. Given the proper (extremely hard to find, due to Rare Item drop rates/combinations, forging, and the other ways of getting gear in the game) you can equip just about any item in the game by using this feature.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em>, there's an area you need a 20000 soul emblem in order to access. Go in and exploit the AI of the enemies there, and you can gain a massive amount of souls (as seen <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBH9R1UsZaQ">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>).
<ul><li> There is also an underground cavern in the Tomb of Giants area, just before you encounter the boss Gravelord Nito, where small skeletons respawn without needing to visit a bonfire whenever you walk into the water at the bottom of the cavern. The skeletons are easy to kill (although because this is <em>Dark Souls</em> they can still pose a danger if you're not careful and they mob you) and, while they don't drop a lot of souls on their own, you can fight so many of them at once it racks up quickly. Even better, they're one of the very few enemies in the game to also drop Humanity, so this is an excellent place to grind especially if you're trying to gain ranks in the Chaos Servant covenant.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII">Dark Souls II</a></em>, Heide's Tower of Flame is good for grabbing levels in the early game, as long as you get the hang of fighting Old Knights: their powerful but slow attacks are generally fairly predictable, they're easy to circle-strafe, and without using a Bonfire Ascetic to increase they're worth a cool 400 souls apiece, the highest non-boss reward you've likely seen so early in the game. For bonus points, most of them are pretty easy to kite down to the starting area, right next to the bonfire, so even if a fight <em>does</em> go sideways, your collected souls will be easy to recover. It's not an unlimited supply of souls (when not in the Company of Champions covenants in the SotFS version), because enemies in <em>II</em> normally stop respawning after they die 15 times or so, but that still means that you can make thousands of souls simply by doing some relatively easy fights until the things you're fighting stop appearing. Just for extra fun, if you can save up 10,000 souls and spend them at Merchant Hag Melentia in one sitting, you can then get the Covetous Silver Serpent Ring +1 off her by talking to her without leaving the interaction menu; this will add a cool 20% to all souls gained from killing enemies, meaning that Old Knights are now worth nearly 500 souls apiece.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII">Dark Souls III</a></em> has its own:
<ul><li> As soon as you gain the ability to consistently kill Lothric Knights, the area around the Vordt of the Boreal Valley bonfire is worth about 2000 souls per lap if you get the elite knight in one corner. As a bonus, Lothric Knight weapons and armour sell for 300-500 souls apiece at the Shrine Handmaiden's shop, further speeding it up. This will fall off in the later game, though.
</li><li> The Lothric Castle bonfire has a knight right next to it, who, when you're equipped with all the soul-boosting items, is worth nearly 6000 souls by himself.
</li><li> Going up the stairs near the Anor Londo bonfire can be worth 17000 souls with the right gear.
</li><li> The Dragon-Kin Mausoleum has a knight who will be constantly resummoned, saving you even the time that would usually be required to run to the bonfire and back to respawn enemies.
</li><li> The parts of Farron Keep <em>not</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BubblegloopSwamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BubblegloopSwamp">covered in toxic shit and swamp water</a> offer some pretty quick soul-grabbing opportunities, as long as you feel confident in your ability to finish off Darkwraiths.
</li><li> Yhorm the Giant's bonfire is nice and close to some clerics and gargoyles, as long as you don't aggro them all at once.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PathOfExile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PathOfExile">Path of Exile</a></em> the higher difficulty levels make the sidequest areas much higher-leveled than the areas associated with the main quest path. In the 3rd Act of Merciless difficulty the Archives side area is actually a higher level than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTowerOfOminousness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTowerOfOminousness">Scepter of God</a>.

<ul><li> Since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands">Borderlands</a></em> and its sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">Borderlands 2</a></em> have RPG elements, there are several areas in the game which allow players to take advantage of the opportunity to grind levels and loot chests.
<ul><li> The Rust Commons West area in the first game is the most prominent one in the mid-game zone. It has numerous (often unshielded) enemies which can also be run over with your vehicle. There are also several lootable chests within relatively easy access of the fast-travel station, and a hidden 'developer chest' with better-than-average chances to spawn good weapons that resets every time you save, exit, and reload the game.
</li><li> The same can be said of Lynchwood in <em>Borderlands 2</em>, which has huge lines of sight and a slew of fairly straightforward bandit enemies, making it perfect for a sniper on the go. It also doesn't hurt that it has vending machines available mere steps from the best early sniping vantage points. Finally, it is loaded to the gills with no less than <em>fourteen</em> weapon chests and item lockers.
</li><li> <em>Borderlands 3</em> has Lectra City in early game, which is chock full of weapon and ammo chests as well as enemies. Doing this area's side quests before proceeding with the main quest is a great way to quickly rise up to the rest of the main quest.
</li></ul></li><li> The "Loot Cave" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Destiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Destiny">Destiny</a></em>. Many players, in order to level up quickly and acquire powerful weapons and items, would simply fire their guns into the cave for a period of time, then go in and pick up all the loot. Bungie eventually patched it, only for players to discover <em>another</em> Loot Cave.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder5');">    MMORPG </div><div class="folder" id="folder5" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> If an EXP camp is described as a "insert-word-here-burn" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em>, chances are you're going to get a <em>lot</em> of EXP. Because of the way the game's evolved, it's increasingly rare to find "standard" experience parties anymore, as everyone prefers to abuse the following types of EXP.
<ul><li> The most common type, melee burns (otherwise known as TP burns), do nothing but slaughter birds at a mind-boggling pace. They abuse the fact that colibri birds parrot spells cast on them... but are otherwise very weak and have laughable normal attacks, so melee characters can mow them down effortlessly.
</li><li> Manaburns involve five Black Mages and one level synced leech frying crabs and fish on Qufim Island at a similar pace. Other locations that don't involve level sync include killing tigers in Vunkerl Inlet or ghosts in the past version of Xarcabard, but they all basically involve many mages liquefying a mob in a round or two.
<ul><li> Furthermore, <em>many</em> areas count for solo Black Mages, as beastmaster mobs won't attack you for attacking their pet if they don't see you doing so. A Black Mage can simply pull the pet away while the master's back is turned. Alternatively, killing the pet in one spell will never cause the master to attack you, even if he's looking right at his pet.
</li></ul></li><li> Finally, there are Astral burns (or "SMN burns") in Korroloka Tunnel, in which a max-level player draws/links half the tunnel into following and attacking him, at which point a party of Summoners use Astral Flow and kill every mob instantly while level synced to a low-level leech. It's a very blatant abuse of the level sync system (meant to allow friends of disparate levels to party together), but it's widely and routinely abused so much that Square can't reasonably ban anyone over it.
<ul><li> People will even pay (in-game) money to leech SMN burn exp. A fair number of players get rich by allowing others to leech their way to max level this way, and players who level this way are stereotyped as having, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">bribed their way to victory</a>, and are looked down upon for it.
</li></ul></li><li> The zones from the <em>Vision of Abyssea</em> and <em>Scars of Abyssea</em> micro-expansions were built to be areas where players could acquire huge amounts of XP that make all of the above methods look slow in comparison. This was designed as part of a massive send-off as the playerbase, in theory, moved en mass to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>, but, well...
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranblueFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranblueFantasy">Granblue Fantasy</a></em>:
<ul><li> There are Angel Halo quests which pit the players against easy-to-kill enemies, and they drop dozens of treasure chests containing lots of EXP fodders, which further increase the levels of the players' characters, weapons, or summons.
</li><li> The Weekend Sliming quests serves as one for players who are easily able to deal Non-Elemental Damage, the entry cost is equivalent to the Angel Halo, but the enemies in Weekend Slimes can provide up to a ten thousand experience points or coins per run.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em>, several of the areas in Spookyraven Manor work this way, with different areas tuned to different stats. This is especially useful with Clovers later on - a properly-equipped player (with a lot of funds) can reach level 15 easily through them, without a single combat. For players in a long <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtendedGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtendedGameplay">aftercore</a> who've outgrown this area, anyplace with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelScaling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelScaling">Level Scaling</a> monsters is the next choice, such as the GameInformPowerDailyPro Dungeon. For players seeking to reach the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighLevelCap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighLevelCap">Absurdly High Level Cap</a>, The Mansion of Dr. Weirdeaux is the only option.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em> has Peregrine Island, while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfVillains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfVillains">City of Villains</a></em> has Grandville, both being the highest-level zones. Briefly, there was a lot of powerlevelling in the starter zones due to a bug.
</li><li> Due to how leveling is handled in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceOnline">Ace Online</a> / Air Rivals</em>, there are only several maps where each class goes to: A-Gears usually settle in Alioth, while higher level ones prefer Lumein Volcano. B-Gears prefer Dimension Corridor "wall", or when not available, Island Dream or again, Alioth. Defense M-Gears can also grind in Alioth or sharegrind with B-Gears in Dimension Corridor or Chaos. For I-Gears however, there's only one map: CMM (short for Chaos Mission Map). The catch? Due to the intense PVP-based gaming that ''Ace Online' is, Alioth and CMM are perpetually open to both nations, meaning that while it is usually a no-fire zone, wars often break out to determine "ownership" of said maps. Island Dream and Dimension Corridor likewise has an "open" version as well.
<ul><li> The maps above primarily satisfy the "very weak and numerous" rule. Otherwise, these maps wouldn't be as popular; each map enemy's exp reward vs. toughness is inherently progressing lower and lower (that is, enemies get tougher while yielding dismally low exp in return) as players advance in maps, so these grindmaps make up for it by sheer numbers of mobs even though the exp reward becomes more and more useless as level progresses. For instance, a level 8x I-Gear would take 2-3 kills in Chaos Mission Map to bring his/her exp bar up by 0.01!
</li></ul></li><li> For about a day, there was a quest in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsGalaxies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsGalaxies">Star Wars: Galaxies</a></em> which got you half a level for every completion. This quest was repeatable, but it was intended that the opposing faction (Rebel or Imperial) was supposed to stop you. Fortunately for the Rebels, the Imperial players didn't feel like it. This made it possible for the Rebel players to continuously complete the quest, allowing for very quick leveling. Many players were literally able to jump 70+ levels in that one day (a feat which should have taken weeks or months normally).
</li><li> Lion Heart Castle/Lion King Castle (Usually abbreviated as LHC, regardless of region) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory">MapleStory</a></em>. It is one of several Party-Play zones in the game that gives extra experience if more people are in your party. During 2X events (where the experience given by monsters is doubled) it's not uncommon to find almost every map with at least one party grinding. Killing one mob can give hundreds of thousands of experience, which you'll need at higher levels.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GaiaOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GaiaOnline">zOMG!</a>: Due to experience being an item-drop, most boss instances can be repeatedly farmed for "Charge Orbs" if you have a full party, but the Saw Mill is the most popular due to its accessibility, simplicity, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneySpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneySpider">gold payout</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> random dungeon groups are often viewed as one of the best ways to quickly grind levels and gain gear. The combination of experience from mobs, quests, and the completion bonus are significant and the drops are generally superior to average quest rewards at the same level.
<ul><li> Deepholm is a preferred location for power-leveling to 85 by using locations with fast-respawning enemies and NPCs willing to help kill them.
</li><li> During <em>Legion</em>, players quickly discovered a cave in the Highmountain area that was filled with monsters that gave good XP, respawned quickly, and were neutral to the players so that if you were careful, you wouldn't pull more than you could handle. For the first few months after the expansion opened, the matchmaking tool was full of players making 5-person groups to farm more effectively.
</li></ul></li><li> The "intended" way to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrind">Level Grind</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> is to run all your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayEveryDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayEveryDay">daily roulettes</a>, then the highest-level available dungeon. However, due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamagerHealerTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamagerHealerTank">strict party composition rules</a> not matching the playerbase's actual demographics, queue times for this can get quite lengthy for DPS players. Deep Dungeons give less EXP per run, but since they ignore the party composition rules, the queues are nearly instant, resulting in significantly faster EXP gains per hour for DPS players.
</li><li> Hydron, Sedna is the de facto leveling spot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em>, as its a mid/late-game endless Defense mission. Its so popular that you can easily get full squads for leveling at almost any time of day on any platform. However, there are a few other noteworthy spots such as Helene, Saturn.
<ul><li> Elite Sanctuary Onslaught has somewhat surpassed Hydron. You can't level warframes there, though, as the mission requires you to equip a max-rank frame.

This can be achieved as early as Aztec Falcon's stage. After finishing the mission, return to the area, home to Totem Cannons. Attacking these Cannons repeatedly (since they regenerate infinitely on the spot) would level up Zero's skills with no penalty.
<ul><li> The introductory stage's area works very well for this, too, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMaker">spiders that constantly spawn from their nests</a>.

Not only are they great for getting bolts by selling the desert crystals and moonstones, they have lots of enemies that you can clear out. Great for upgrading your weapons, especially the ones you unlock later such as the Hoverbomb Gun. Tabora is especially good on Challenge Mode due to the bolt multiplier you'll unlock by that point, and both sandboxes are even better in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">Challenge Mode</a> due to the bolts you receive for giving them to the New Age Mystic being multiplied by <em>10</em>!

<ul><li> The sewer stage of Aquatos serves the same function as Tabora and Grelbin except that half the map is locked away until you get the gravity boots. The Quack-o-Ray is incredibly useful here as it can morph most of the enemies there in an instant, you'll be forced to encounter literally hundreds of them as you hunt for Sewer Crystals, and the weapon has unlimited ammo.
</li><li> It also has Annihilation Nation which offers huge cash prizes and good EXP drops early on.

Windmill Isle Act 1-2 and Jungle Joyride Act 1-2 in particular are both very generous with EXP if you defeat every enemy and smash every breakable object along the way to the goal, resulting in around 30 full bars of EXP to spend per visit (note that the typical full-length story-mandatory stages tend to only give out about 10 bars of EXP on average).

But since you cross two bridges to get there, it can be dangerous. In the original Dragon Warrior/Quest, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters">Random Encounters</a> became exponentially more difficult with each bridge crossed.
</li><li> There's also a strip at the edge of Rimuldar where you can encounter the enemy set from the Cantlin area.
</li><li> The game is full of these. Besides the famous coast of Rimuldar, there is the "Scorpion's Nest", a row of hills southwest of Tantegel with enemies from the Mountain Cave region, and a strip of land northeast of Hauksness with enemies from the Dragonlord's island. DQ1 even has reverse PoPs - areas with much weaker monsters than you should be fighting (the mouth of the Mountain Cave, a strip northwest of Hauksness, the entrance to the Dragonlord's island, and a huge area of hills southeast of Cantlin).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestII">Dragon Quest II</a></em>, the bottom part of the island of Osterfair is home to groups of <em>eight</em> Metal Slimes, and certain floors of the Cave to Rhone can be farmed for Metal Babbles.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVI">Dragon Quest VI</a></em> has one applicable to improving jobs — while most areas have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">Cap</a> that, should your levels pass it, make it so you cannot improve your jobs in the areas in question, the Spiegelspire does not. As such, you can always return there and wail on mid-game enemies when your power well exceeds what you need to plow through them and improve jobs at your leisure, and the Zoom spell allows the party to travel there anytime when outdoors in the Dream World. Particularly useful as mastering jobs gives stat bonuses and access to multiple powerful attacks that don't cost anything to use and do a fixed amount of damage on multiple enemies that you can use regardless of your current job. The well in real-world Somnia is a more traditional example, as it contains enemies of a far higher level than can be found nearby.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVII">Dragon Quest VII</a></em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Slime Forest</a>. A forest area north of Krage. While there you fight nothing but slimes of all kinds, including Metal Slimes, Metal King Slimes, Metal Babbles, and Gold Slimes. Best place in the game for money and experienced. Even better is the fact every fight, even those against normal slimes give you Job Points no matter your level. No better place to max out everything you want in the game.
</li><li> The Slime Plateau in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVIII">Dragon Quest VIII</a></em> - while not as filled with Metal Slimes as the aforementioned Metal Menagerie (but with no time limit), it has three different varieties that are all common encounters. You're pretty much guaranteed to take down a few sooner or later.
<ul><li> The Dragon Graveyard, contains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime">Metal King Slimes</a>. These often appear with a Beelzebuzz or two, whose "Kerplunk" spell kills the bug but revives all other monsters. Find a battle with a MKS and several friends, then slay the slime once and wait for it to revive - once for each Beelzebuzz. You can win over 120,000 EXP in the luckiest encounters, along with several shots at the ultra-rare items MKS carry.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX">Dragon Quest IX</a></em> has its own Slime Plateau near the starting town, with Metal Slimes, Metal Medleys, and Liquid Metal Slimes being fairly common encounters. The catch is that the player doesn't get the ability to fly up there until <em>after</em> the main story is completed, though with the large amount of post-game content this still ends up being quite useful. (Before beating the game, however, players commonly walk up and down a set of stairs in the Bowhole until a Liquid Metal Slime appears and keep defeating those; they're less common than on the plateau, but it's more or less the best way to grind closer to the end of the main story.)
<ul><li> The game's randomly-generated grotto system means there's a chance that some floors will contain metal slimes, and possibly nothing but Metal King Slimes. <a class="urllink" href="https://dragon-quest.org/wiki/Masayuki_map">A Japanese player found one such map<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, renamed Masayuki's map in his honor.

Later on, the Other Side, the Royal Library, and Mount Huji have noticeably elevated chances of encountering metal monsters compared to other areas. In the 3DS and <em>Definitive Edition</em> rereleases, the Tickington sidequest features the Masayuki map as one of the locations representing <em>Dragon Quest IX</em>, and completing the quests there adds a number of postgame enemies and Metal King Slimes to the previously empty sixth floor. These enemies can drop powerful equipment long before it could be gotten in a normal playthrough, including the strongest claw weapon that doesn't require crafting. Also introduced in this version is the Pillar of Pegasus, representing <em>Dragon Quest VI</em>, which contains a Mimic that respawns each time the player leaves Tickington and returns. The Mimic drops a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareCandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareCandy">Seed of Skill</a> each time it's slain, allowing the player to quickly farm all 73 they need to max out each character's skill grid.
</li><li> The Metal Menagerie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestMonsters">Dragon Quest Monsters</a>: Joker</em>.

Still better is the random Dark World <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a> — each room has a random family of monsters that only appear, which changes upon entering and leaving. However, going into Tag mode and immediately exiting it causes the monsters to shuffle but <em>not</em> the family — meaning in a Slime room you can keep shuffling until you find <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime">Metal Kaizer Slimes</a> — the next step up from Metal Kings. In addition, the Metal Menagerie makes a comeback (and much earlier in the game, too), and there is a bonus dungeon version of it — finishing a simple find the exit bonus game in the Dark World (trivial if you have a map) sends you to the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightWorld">Light World</a>, a copy of the tutorial zone filled to the brim with Metal Kings that you can stay in for <em>30 minutes</em>.

<ul><li> There's also two eastmost reachable spaces of land around the south bridge that police officers are blocking where you can fight things like Mad Cars for good EXP.
</li><li> That pitch-black train tunnel contains very tough enemies that are normally found later in the game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate">just to make sure you don't get to the next area without paying</a>. By abusing Offense Up and Defense Up correctly (both of which are <em>very</em> inexpensive spells), however, you can turn this area into a level-grinding treadmill, as a few enemies here give up to 200 experience points. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">If you don't know what you're doing, though...</a>

<ul><li> Throughout the game there's several enemies which will summon more enemies after a turn or 2, sometimes summoning more of themselves, such as the Happy Happy Cultists. This means that it's all too easy to whittle down the HP of the summoner so it can be taken out in one hit, defend until it summons another enemy, then take out the summoned enemy and repeat as long as desired to easily and quickly gain massive amounts of experience and thus jump several levels in a single battle.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiSuperstarSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiSuperstarSaga">Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga</a></em>, as soon as you get down from Hoohoo Mountain, you're supposed to go to Beanbean Castle Town and advance the plot from there, but nothing is stopping you from venturing north to fight Tanoombas or far east to fight Bomb-ombs. Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionCommands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionCommands">the game's mechanics</a>, a player who knows the attack patterns of these monsters can reap some massive rewards from them without being hit in return. A Tanoomba's attacks are ridiculously easy to dodge/counter, and they yield thirty experience points and the occasional Green Pepper (for comparison, a Dry Bones from Hoohoo Mountain gives six XP); Bomb-ombs are tougher to deal with, but they yield almost fifty XP apiece and sometimes drop Nuts.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiDreamTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiDreamTeam">Mario &amp; Luigi: Dream Team</a></em> has this in the second area of the game. You see, while you're supposed to adventure through Mushrise Park and a couple of other areas before heading to Wakeport, the path to said area isn't actually inaccessible in the meantime (just the door to the actual town). And in this area, you can find plenty of easy to defeat Hermite Crab enemies that you're meant to fight in about five hours time at a much higher level. So it's very easy and useful to just head left instead of south when you first reach the park, and fight the crabs instead of the weak mooks you'd encounter in the next area, letting you gain some very fast levels and experience in the process.

There is also "shaking grass" which has a high chance of encountering Audino, a Pokemon that yields a high amount of experience, as well as dark grass which has tough Pokemon but grant better experience than the ones found on normal grass. Pinwheel Forest is particularly useful for shaking grass grinding in the early game; there are several areas where you can walk around on empty ground with ease until you see grass shake, there are two different Fighting-types capable of exploiting its main weakness nearby, even if you're not interested in those, you're given an unlimited-use TM of the Fighting-type move Rock Smash, and when things start to go south you can just walk out of the forest and talk to a nurse for an instant heal.
<ul><li> While rematches have been removed, <em>Black and White</em> and <em>Black 2 and White 2</em> have many daily repeatable trainer matches like the Nimbasa Stadium. <em>Black 2 and White 2</em> also have the Black Tower (for Black 2) and White Treehollow (for White 2). Both are the same areas which have a random, maze-like route with trainers you can fight leading up to the "boss" of the floor. You can repeatedly challenge the floor and lower floors net tougher enemies. Even better, the Pokemon Breeder trainers in this area have two members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinataEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinataEnemy">Chan</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">sey</a> family, which (aside from Happiny) give out the most EXP in the games.
</li><li> <em>Black 2 and White 2</em> have one better - a strange new mechanic added to all Breeders, a type of trainer class you can battle, allows to you re-battle them whenever you leave the route or area they're encountering in. Breeders show up randomly in the Nimbasa stadiums after defeating the Champion, as they did in Black and White, and give out Rare Candies, an item that instantly boosts a Pokemon's level by 1, when defeated there. The kicker is that the rematching mechanic and the Rare Candy rewards are <em>not</em> mutually exclusive, nor are they restricted to once a day - you can effectively grind Rare Candies indefinitely if you're lucky enough to get a Breeder or two in one of the stadiums.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pokémon X and Y</a></em> has the Battle Chateau, which is found halfway between the first and second Gyms. It has Trainers to battle, most of whom will pay out a decent amount of money (especially with the Amulet Coin, which is found nearby). As you defeat Trainers, your rank will increase, as will the rank of your opponents. Higher-ranked Trainers have stronger Pokémon; for example, a Marchioness (with a semi-unique model) with two level 35 Audino. It's also possible to rebattle Gym Leaders once your rank is high enough. With enough time and patience, it's entirely possible to have Pokémon at post-game levels before you reach the second Gym, although for traded Pokémon the obedience problem still remains.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonUltraSunAndUltraMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonUltraSunAndUltraMoon">Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon</a></em> has the Ultra Warp Ride.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonUranium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonUranium">Pokémon Uranium</a></em> has a number of opportunities for fast rematches:
<ul><li> In the first Pokemon Center you encounter, there's a trainer who will rematch you as many times as you want. His Pokemon are very weak, but healing after each battle is only a few steps away.
</li><li> Your rival, Theo, will join you several times to double-battle your way through an area, and will fully heal all your Pokemon after each battle, making it easy to continue grinding for as long as you want.
</li><li> Theo will also hang around near the Labyrinth for infinite rematches, until you advance the plot. With a good counter for each of his Pokemon, you can advance levels quite quickly.
</li><li> After completing the optional Ninja Reunion side-quest, you can have as many rematches as you want against six different ninja, each using 5 copies of a single Pokemon species (one for each type of Effort Value), or directly train Effort Values for each stat for free.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em>:
<ul><li> Early on in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI">Kingdom Hearts</a></em>, there is an area in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin">Agrabah</a> that spawns four Black Fungus 25% of the time. Defeating them will get 96exp each, making them useful for grinding early on despite their tendecy to turn invincible half the time. This is combined with the palace entrance in the 1.5 version, which has a 75% chance of spawning 12 pots. Destroying the 11 real pots while avoiding the Pot Scorpion (unbeatable without Aeroga) nets 155exp<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0zdla');"><sup>hint </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0zdla" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0zdla');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the scorpion cannot be moved while disgused as a pot</span>.
<ul><li> Unlike later games, doing the tournaments in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Hercules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Hercules">Olympus Coliseum</a> allows you to obtain experience, making them very useful for level grinding before Hollow Bastion. A good example is the Pegasus Cup, which has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Leon</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Yuffie</a> as the bosses, and with enough Tech Boosts, one can get tons of experence by reflecting Yuffie's shurikens.
</li><li> The Chimera in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNightmareBeforeChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNightmareBeforeChristmas">Halloween Town</a> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMooksClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMooksClothing">Boss in Mook's Clothing</a>, but has two forms, the second of which can provide a lot of tech experience divided by 10 should Sora reflect the heads away from the jar by attacking it. Bonus points that the Chimera is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlunkyBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlunkyBoss">Flunky Boss</a> that calls for backup every time it returns to its first form, but these enemies also drop good EXP and tons of MP balls, allowing lots of magic.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em>, there's a specific area of the Pride Lands—Pride Rock, specifically—with an incredibly thick swarm of Heartless in it. By using area-of-effect spells like Magnega, one can gain massive amounts of experience in a short time. You'll also find yourself with more munny than you know what to do with. This was nerfed in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Final Mix version</a>, where the swarm only has a 20% chance of showing up.
<ul><li> For even more EXP, you can disable Donald's Cure spell, get your HP down to critical levels by getting hit, then equipping the Experience Boost ability and Gullwing Keyblade (both raise EXP when low on health).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PiratesOfTheCaribbean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PiratesOfTheCaribbean">Port Royal</a> can be this for leveling up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Drive Forms</a>. If you let a Gambler transform you into a die or a card while you are in Drive Form, your HP, MP and Drive gauge will be restored when you turn back. This way you can level each form up nonstop without having to worry about the Drive gauge running out.
</li><li> Again, Agrabah has the first room of the Cave of Wonders. Unlike most locations, the Heartless respawn after only going one room away, and the second room has a save point. With Drive Converter, it is an ideal spot to level up Master Form.
</li><li> After a certain point, you can gain a truckload of XP just by going to the bottom of the Organization XIII tower, carving your way through them, then hopping into your ship and reappearing at the bottom again. Also works for grinding Final Form, since that only powers up when you kill Nobodies and <em>guess what's all over the tower?</em>
</li><li> Sometimes, the player party will wonder around a location as NPCs. If Sora is in a Drive Form when he enters a room with his allies as NPCs, he will revert and the Drive Bar is reset (similar to the Gambler example above). The Solar Sailor (from the I.O. Tower) in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tron">Space Paranoids</a> is a permanent case, allowing Drive Form grinding (and Elixir farming). The graveyard room in The Castle That Never Was is also a good spot for Final Form after Riku joins the party, but before the first battle with Xemnas.
</li><li> Possibly the best place for leveling most Drive Forms and Summons is Hall of the Cornerstone (Disney Castle)/Cornerstone Hill (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SteamboatWillie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SteamboatWillie">Timeless River</a>). There are 4 rooms that are easily accessible and have a decent amount of enemies. The best part? The door between Cornerstone Hill and Hall of the Cornerstone removes you from a drive form and resets your drive bar. Simply enter, kill enemies until you're almost out of drive, and run out. Rinse and repeat.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Bequerel Mine copper gathering mission in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTillTheEndOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTillTheEndOfTime">Star Ocean: Till the End of Time</a></em> - assuming the near-end boss Demetrio has been defeated - allows a small window of time to explore the dragon-infested Bequerel Mountain, with several save points and a free bed-for-healing, allowing the player to train indefinitely. The player, who is expected to be somewhere near level 19 by this point, can reach levels of 35 and higher with enough grinding.
<ul><li> And if the player is crazy enough to try, the Sanmite Republic is open after rescuing Ameena. Just outside is a number of higher-level bird type enemies, and beyond Surferio is a cave leading to the Mosel dunes, an area the party won't be visiting till <em>much</em> later. With proper management of the bonus gauge, training in these places becomes (mildly) feasible.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarIV">Phantasy Star IV</a></em>, relatively early on, you have the opportunity to fight monsters called sand worms (there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideQuest">Side Quest</a> where you can fight a severely de-powered one, but here we're talking about an infinite number of the real deal). Sand worms have a lot of HP, and their attacks will be lethal to one or all of your party members at low levels. However, <em>if</em> you can take one down, it gives a fairly massive amount of experience. Once your characters can survive at least one hit, it's one of the best monsters to farm until you can access the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a>.
<ul><li> Also in <em>Phantasy Star IV</em>, after the battle with Zio, two of your party members leave the group. Since EXP rewards are split between characters, it means that any battles fought from the time Gryz and Demi leave to the point where Wren and Raja join are giving each character 33% of the total XP instead of 20%. Going back into Nurvus and hunting the Tarantellas (which Rune can wipe out in a single spell) are a great way to grind, since a full screen is worth well over 1000 EXP. If you're not shy about letting Rika and Chaz bite it, Rune can hoard that EXP for himself, and walk into the second half of the game with most of his Skill list filled out (and thus several of the game's best Combination Attacks).
</li><li> Related to Rune's amazing potential, the first time he's acquired for a short span while leading the party to Tonoe. During this time, if you were to kill off the rest of the party except Chaz, you have a very easy time with Rune's Multi-hit spells to gain Chaz a great deal of levels very quickly.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireII">Breath of Fire II</a></em> has Monster Island far to the north, home to a pair of cameo appearances from the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireI">Breath of Fire</a></em> and Skull Island-issue <em>giant</em> versions of the game's cannon fodder monsters; needless to say, this is a great place to level grind before facing the final dungeon. Another common level grinding location is Nightrider Island to the south, named for a rare enemy encountered on the island (although this fan name may be affected by the upcoming fan retranslation project, which restores "N. Rider" to the original name of "Ragnarider").
<ul><li> Made even better that Monster Island is available <em>as soon as you obtain the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetOnTheBoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetOnTheBoat">Grandpa Whale</a></em>.
<ul><li> Also in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireII">Breath of Fire II</a></em>, early in the game before you try to break the spell on Jean, there's a signpost Southeast of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimaFort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimaFort">Sima Fort</a>. If you wander around the squares just south of the sign, you find orange crabs that are incredibly powerful, but die very fast to Thunder spells. Once Nina learns S.Boom, she kills them all in one shot and goes before them and they give 2x the XP anything else in the area does.
</li></ul></li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireI">Breath of Fire</a></em>, said island was to the north and was notable, on the map, for having a tower on it that was part of the endgame dungeon run prior to Obelisk. It had both Ryu's most powerful weapon, and the massive Gold Slimes which you could grind until you were absurdly leveled.
<ul><li> The Gold Slimes apparently underwent evolution between the first and second games, as they exist on Monster Island in 2, but shrunk down to the size of the E. Sludges you encounter in the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeTown">Home Town</a> area, and are now called K. Sludges. It's almost a MUST to have G.Drgn/Kaiser to drop on these suckers, because they come 3 in a group, 1000 HP per Sludge, hit hard, don't take much damage otherwise, AND can effectively cast Death.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireIII">Breath of Fire III</a></em> has Mt. Zublo. The Lavamen there can be quickly upgraded to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">Boss in Mook Clothing</a> status by repeatedly using fire attacks. A properly-prepared party <em>can</em> survive the battle, and earn an outrageous experience reward.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BreathofFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BreathofFire">Breathof Fire</a></em> games in general split the XP earned amongst your group members. Anytime a group member is isolated because of plot reasons, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeninsulaOfPowerLeveling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeninsulaOfPowerLeveling">Peninsula of Power Leveling</a> is found nearby:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireI">Breath of Fire I</a></em>: After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the debacle having to do with the Time machine</span>, Ryu is isolated by himself. Normally you walk straight North into a town to be re-united with your group. Instead, you can use items that prevent battles, and backtrack to a nearby town where you can gain 5x-8x the XP per battle to push Ryu's levels insanely high very quickly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireIII">Breath of Fire III</a></em>: Ryu first goes to Mt. Myrneg after he's been separated from Rei and Teepo. There, he can find Tar Man enemies, who are extremely powerful for the area...but can be trivially frozen with the Frost spell you can learn from Mygas. These give Ryu a lot of experience.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireIV">Breath of Fire IV</a></em>: Going to the Great Plains forces Ryu to go alone. There's a Temple-like area where Nut Troops appear. If you knew this ahead of time, you might have had Ryu learn the Burn spell (they are weak against fire). Take Ryu there with a bunch of cheap healing herbs and Burn all the Nut Troops there until you run out of AP. Easy XP that isn't cut by group members; the XP you get here is far better than anywhere else. But, again, only Ryu levels up in this way. Still, high level Ryu beats low level Ryu.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Grandia1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Grandia1">Grandia</a></em>, there's easy way to get your Water spell levels to 99; In Mt. Typhoon, run around on the poisonous puddles to lose your HP and then heal yourself afterwards to gain easy experience.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondTheBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondTheBeyond">Beyond the Beyond</a></em>, about halfway through the game, you gain access to Leave Village. In the mountains to the west you can fight enemies you normally would fight near the end of the game.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIIINocturne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIIINocturne">Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne</a></em> following the highway east of Ginza will lead to Shibaura, where enemies there are roughly level 28-33 when normal foes are in the teens. What makes it good for power leveling instead of getting youself killed is that the two enemies of any threat are both weak to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">Standard Status Effects</a> that prevent all actions by them. These encounters net over 10 times the experience from a normal fight in the area. Given that the next boss is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ThatOneBoss/Atlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ThatOneBoss/Atlus">Mata</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss">dor</a> you may need it.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiI">Shin Megami Tensei I</a></em>, there is a shrine in the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">post-nuke world</span>, where the enemies have levels in the 40s. All of these enemies are vulnerable to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">Standard Status Effects</a>, most notably Marin-Karin, which causes them to attack themselves and their allies. As the experience gain for battles increases based on the level difference between your party and the enemy's, and you can first go to the shrine at about level 20, you can easily get multiple levels per battle.
</li><li> In Megami Tensei for the NES, you can go straight to the final dungeon as soon as you defeat the second boss to fight enemies that are multiple times stronger than you are.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigitalDevilSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigitalDevilSaga">Digital Devil Saga</a></em> features the Titania Tunnels, located in the Manipura Waterways. There you'll encounter nothing but groups of Titanias, whose attacks can easily be reflected to inflict them with fear, making them easy to devour. Not only does this get you a ton of Atma Points quickly, but Titanias also drop extremely valuable <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash">Vendor Trash</a></em> so you can keep buying more abilities. Making this slightly risky is Arahabaki, a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">Boss in Mook Clothing</a></em> that makes the real bosses look like pansies. They have a chance of showing up as reinforcements in virtually any battle, sometimes in groups of two. But if you have Cocytus, you can take them out fairly easily.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em>:
<ul><li> You can visit 65,000,000 BC as soon as you access the End of Time, several dungeons before you actually need to go there. There lies the Dactyl's Nest, an area that's traversed during your second visit. The enemies there give three times the typical amount of experience that battles in the next storyline dungeon do, at only a mild increase in difficulty.
</li><li> There's also the Nu in the Hunting Range. It can't kill you, but you can kill it for lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechPoints">Tech Points</a>.
</li><li> Magus's fortress has a chamber (right-hand path from entryway) before the room where Flea was fought that has three groups that drop 413 experience each (which is decent), but each one also often drops a Mid-Ether (restores 30 magic points in battle), 720 gold (which is nice), and give 11 Tech Points for icing on the cake.
</li><li> While taken aboard the Blackbird, you can encounter mooks which, despite posing a minimal threat, still give more experience than their challenging recolors from the Ocean Palace.
</li><li> There's a respawning Rubble on an island near the Mountain of Woe. This enemy gives 1000 EXP and 100 Tech Points, which means easy grinding. The only downside is that after a certain point in the story, the Mountain of Woe becomes unavailable.
</li><li> On the Black Omen, there is a hall which puts you against three enemies every time you walk through it, two of which will give you massive amounts of Tech Points, but distract you from the middle enemy which has a very strong attack, and they leave if you beat it first. However, once you're strong enough to beat them all before they can attack, the place becomes an easy area to get enough TP to get all Abilities.
<ul><li> Also on the Black Omen, there's a room that generates six alien-type enemies not seen anywhere else in the game. Four of these enemies can have Magic Capsules Charmed off of them. What makes this truly excellent is that these enemies have no attacks whatsoever except an instant-death counter... that only triggers after a <em>physical attack</em>. Thus you can charm 4 Magic Capsules, escape, leave the area, come back, charm another 2 Capsules, rinse and repeat until every character's Magic stat is maxed out. The only downside is that once you <em>do</em> kill these enemies, they don't come back. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Ever</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Finally, Mother Brain's fortress starts with a conveyor belt which has five sets of enemies, which reward a total combined EXP of roughly 10,000, far greater than any other location in the entire game. It also gives a decent amount of Tech Points. A garbage chute at the end of the belt allows you to travel back to the beginning and reset the enemies, making it the perfect location to grind up to level 99 (or **).
<ul><li> Even better, by this point you should have at least one Golden Stud (even more if you've made a side-trip to the Black Omen and Charmed some more). This nifty accessory reduces MP costs by a whopping 75%. At this point, "grinding" more or less devolves into "Have a character spam an all-enemy hitting Tech, stopping at an Enertron when your MP gets low".
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> has this on its second playthrough, in the Monad Block. This new area of Tartarus is accessible from the lobby, and has super-powerful monsters. Ordinarily this would be a problem, but (if you put enough time into the first playthrough), your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>-powered protagonist can probably kill these monsters by himself, adding 10 to 20 levels at a time to your party members - which allows you to rapidly out level even this grindy game, and speed on through to the interesting parts by only fighting bosses (and intimidating everything else to run away from your party).
<ul><li> The Monad Block is accessible in the first playthrough as well... but to reach it, you must defeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkedByTheBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkedByTheBell">the Reaper</a>. It's worth it simply to see how long the final boss lasts with an all-Level 99 party (answer: about 15 minutes, and that's only because he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss">14 forms</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PersonaQShadowOfTheLabyrinth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PersonaQShadowOfTheLabyrinth">Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth</a></em>, oddly, you're most likely to get more experience from the final floor of the third labyrinth rather than the death trap in the final floor of the <em>fourth</em> one.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms1">Wild ARMs: Alter Code F</a></em> (the remake of the original), the area around Adelhyde Castle is a goldmine of both money and experience, if you know how to farm the monsters correctly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia">Skies of Arcadia</a></em> has a fairly large overworld area in the far upper-left corner of the map that has no affiliation with any of the other areas. This largely empty area has been dubbed "Looper Sea" by fans, due to the fact that every enemy encounter in this area contains nothing but experience filled Looper enemies and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">palette swaps</a>. This makes it a prime location for Power Leveling, since Loopers are typically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime">rare and have a tendency to run away</a> as soon as battles begin.
<ul><li> The pacing of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia">Skies of Arcadia</a></em> can cause you to accidentally power level if you take a long time to find the discoveries. Plus, there's an area in the arctic sections while flying on a ship that yield encounters with multiple purple loopers. (The strongest looper, which nets the best exp.) And if you're smart, you'll equip a "Black Map", which makes it impossible (Or at least very hard) to run away while attracting more random battles!
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaAndTheFortressOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaAndTheFortressOfDoom">Lufia &amp; The Fortress of Doom</a></em>, as soon as you get the ability to control a ship, you can quite easily go out of your way and fight monsters you wouldn't fight for several levels, gaining much more experience than expected. It also helps that you can reach Frederia by ship and obtain much more powerful equipment than you would be expected to have.
<ul><li> Arus Cave has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime">Mimickers</a> as a not-too-uncommon encounter. The kicker is that the plot requires you to travel through the cave several times over (let alone getting all of the treasure), meaning it's likely you'll gain half a dozen levels from Mimickers alone.
</li><li> If you're prudent with levelling, you can access the later floors of the Old Cave long before you encounter the powerful monsters (and equipment) found within during the normal course of the game. The seventh and final floor is especially notable, since it's possible to obtain the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> from the Hydras encountered there.
</li></ul></li><li> Once you get a ship in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaIIRiseOfTheSinistrals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaIIRiseOfTheSinistrals">Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals</a></em>, you can find a small island that seems to serve no purpose, but has an enemy population solely made up of all four varieties of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime">Cubes</a>. While you can't reach it until late in the game, it's perfect for buffing your characters for the last dungeons.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaTheRuinsOfLore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaTheRuinsOfLore">Lufia: The Ruins of Lore</a></em>, <em>any</em> dungeon where Cores can spawn. Cores will always attempt to flee from the party until they hit a wall. Approaching an enemy from behind always earns a preemptive attack. Cores' sky-high Defense does nothing against magic or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">Chance Hit</a>. Enjoy.
</li><li> Thanks to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug">Good Bad Bug</a>, the gate between Muse and Matilda in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenII">Suikoden II</a></em> is pushable: as long as you don't talk to the guards around the normally closed gate, you can just walk straight through it. On the other side is a zone which you aren't supposed to reach until noticeably later in the game, with appropriately leveled monsters and items in the shops. There's also a pair of recruitable party members who join you temporarily to complete a side-quest (and join permanently at the end of the quest). All you have to do is make a mad dash from the gate to the town where these two are, and you can grind all your low-leveled members up in a matter of a few fights and use the money to buy them good armor.
<ul><li> This was also possible in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenI">Suikoden</a></em> after you pass through the Fortress of Kwaba. Head straight south to the Great Forest, which you normally won't head to for another few hours. It isn't possible yet to go past the first screen, but that screen alone is filled with Kobold enemies that are very easily taken out with area of effect magic like a Fire Rune (such as the one Cleo normally has). You don't even have to grind that long to get your characters a significant EXP boost, which makes the next few dungeons rather easy. Making it even better, there's a town just before the dungeon itself with an inn that you can use to recharge when you run out of fire magic.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostOdyssey">Lost Odyssey</a></em> has Numara Atoll, which will give you one of two random encounters - Silver Kelolon, or Hell Shaker. The latter gives huge EXP (guaranteed level up upon defeating until around 47 or so), but is nearly impossible to beat when you are first able to reach the island, while the former is a spineless wimp whose first action is almost always to run away. Swat the Silver Kelolon with Gamble and huge EXP and AP gains are yours. Numara Atoll is the grinding spot of choice through nearly three discs' worth of story progression.
<ul><li> You defeat the Hell Shakers quite easily at a low level if you use the following technique. Have everyone learn Gamble (Mack knows it naturally after a certain event, Jansen and Cooke can equip Spirit magic items, and the Immortals can learn it from Mack). Enter battle with a Hell Shaker, and have one character physically attack, and the rest use Gamble. For the majority of the time, the Hell Shaker's first move will be to use an All-Water spell, because by physically attacking, the attack will be pushed back one turn. Spam Gamble, and hopefully you'll take it out before the spell can hit.
</li><li> By disc 4 though, there is the Temple of Enlightenment, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">which is basically the toughest dungeon in the game.</a> Although all of the enemies in there give off loads of experience, Hellish Kelolons will instantly level you up until you hit level 97, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">making pretty much every enemy in the game a breeze.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> All three games in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em> series have examples resulting both from bugs similar to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> and from enemies that are easy to grind:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun2001" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun2001">Golden Sun (2001)</a></em> has two encounter-based areas. The first one is just east of the Bilibin Barricade: The left edge of the mountains in the southern divet before the bridge will spawn encounters from near Xian, including Moles that drop the useful Bramble Seed attack item. The second is just north of Kalay: running against the shore of the Karagol Sea loads the encounters from the Tolbi area on the other side of the sea. These enemies aren't too difficult for a properly leveled party even at this earlier point, but the amount of experience they give is plenty enough to make them extremely useful for grinding when you first arrive. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And since the upcoming fight with the Kraken is rough enough as is, you'll need all the advantage you can get.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunTheLostAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunTheLostAge">Golden Sun: The Lost Age</a></em> has an area north of Kibombo that loads the encounters near Magma Rock, the penultimate dungeon in the game. It also has the rear chamber of the Islet Cave, a short corridor that leads to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> (probably the easiest of the game's four Bonus Bosses, but still plenty challenging). Said corridor is home to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime">Wonder Bird</a>, the most powerful member of the Phoenix <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndergroundMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndergroundMonkey">family of monsters</a>, which gives enormous EXP gains, can revive its allies, and occasionally appears in pairs. As an extra motivation, one of the other enemies in this area <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops">Randomly Drops</a> the Tisiphone Edge, the strongest Light Blade and therefore Jenna's and Ivan's best weapon, and another drops the best circlet, the Berserker Band. Of course, you have to be about a third of the way through the final dungeon before you can access this area, so you're really only power-leveling to take on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> and the last <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> or two or for battling your friends, but it's still a fairly quick way to level up if your party is much below level 50.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn">Golden Sun: Dark Dawn</a></em> has Rat Warriors appearing in a forest southeast of Kaocho, which normally don't appear until you dock in nearby Tonfon much later in the game. Tonfon itself has one as well, where walking along the edge of the Endless Wall north of town gives you encounters from atop the wall, which is supposed to be the way to the final dungeon. For endgame grinding, the game gives out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciousVideoGameGenerosity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciousVideoGameGenerosity">very sweet deal</a> right before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>. After viewing the cutscene in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Arcanus/Alex appears to double-cross Blados and Chalis</span>, the area surrounding the Apollo Lens becomes filled with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tuaparang warriors</span>, appearing in groups of 2 or 3. They're notably easier than the shadow enemies you faced on the way up to Apollo Sanctum, yet give out a massive 13720 experience points apiece <em>and</em> are guaranteed to drop a Water of Life, the series' revival item. With two of <em>Lost Age</em>'s most notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Bosses</a> returning for this game, it might not be a bad idea to overlevel well past the point needed to trivialize the final boss...
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG">Super Mario RPG</a></em>, Star Hill is the best place to grind.
<ul><li> If you're willing to spam Mallow's Thunderbolt, the Dry Bones between the two sets of clues for the Sunken Ship puzzle offers an even better grinding opportunity: Put the Zoom Shoes and Work Pants on, and then every encounter with this respawning enemy will consist of Mallow blowing the enemies away with a Thunderbolt, 27 Exp. (54 Exp. for the character wearing Exp. Booster) for 2 FP; the money you get here will more than allow you to stock up on Maple Syrups at the nearby Shaman store to replenish the FP, and with concerted grinding, you can make it all the way to level 30 in about 300 encounters. Of course, you'll probably do better stopping after a little under 100 encounters, making best use of the Lucky Jewel and Exp. Booster at the Culex fight in Monstro Town (to get 288 Exp. for 4 characters and 576 Exp. for the Boosted one), and finally getting the rest of your experience at the Machine-Made Yaridovich (60 Exp., 120 Exp. Boosted) just before the factory gates.
</li><li> Some tricks exploit the fact that when you get Game Over, your money and items are reset back to your last save point but your experience and levels are not. There's a spot in Land's End where you can buy an invincibility star power-up for a hefty price right before a roomful of enemies, which lets you clear them out in seconds, almost always granting you a level up or two. Proceed a bit further and lose to Belome. Your coins, the star salesman, and the enemies are back, but the extra levels you got from them are retained. Rinse and repeat as needed.
</li><li> There's a room in Booster Tower that features an infinite row of enemies walking down a flight of stairs. By standing in their path, you can get an unlimited number of battles without moving. Once you are strong enough to beat them in one hit, a turbo controller and a rubber band on the A button will get you all the way to the level cap.
</li></ul></li><li> The area (looks like a valley) between Redding and San Francisco in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em>. The hardest enemies in the game would show up- floaters, aliens, centaurs, fire geckos, but, if you could handle them (if you had enough characters with combat armor/power armor and good guns), you could level after at most 4-5 encounters, even at extremely high levels.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario">Paper Mario</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario64">Paper Mario 64</a></em>, the Flower Fields contain Amazy Dayzees, the enemy with by far the biggest EXP yield. It's the only enemy that can allow Mario to level up twice in one battle (though with Merluvlee's help). It might not sound like much, but in this game, Mario tops off at Level 27, so it's pretty significant. Amazy Dayzees continue to appear in subsequent <em>Paper Mario</em> games and continue the tradition of ridiculously high EXP yield, although they are much more difficult to encounter and defeat. One path in Chapter 3's Forever Forest will also take Mario to an area containing a beehive that will release unlimited Bzzap!, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> enemy that is not formally introduced until Chapter 6.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a></em>, the Amazy Dayzees provide vast amounts of experience <em>no matter what level you are</em>. While most enemies provide less Star Points as you level up (up to the point where they give none at all), the Amazy Dayzee will ALWAYS give you enough to level up quickly. Unfortunately, they are quite strong and only appear rarely in the Twilight Forest and semi-rarely in the depths of the Pit of 100 Trials...but they are the most economical way to reach incredibly high levels.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TreasureOfTheRudra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TreasureOfTheRudra">Treasure of the Rudra</a></em>, at the beginning of Surlent's scenario, you have access to Sakkara Desert, which has powerful monsters which give about 50 times as much EXP and money as the surrounding monsters, and also randomly drop a weapon which is much stronger than anything you could get for a while.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory3">Rune Factory 3</a></em> has two:
<ul><li> An island within the Privera Forrest dungeon, accessible once you have the Lily Pad seed or the Water Shoes. It contains a random <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> every time you visit (and will respawn a new one if you hang around without destroying the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMaker">monster portal</a>) Tough, but will give you loads of XP and valuable boss drops.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a> in your basement: Accessible once you defeat the first boss. Will be FAR above your level at first (You'll probably be around level 5-7. The first level starts at 30) , but each monster will give that much more XP. Plus each dungeon has at least one room with one or two rare chests<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3czo8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3czo8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3czo8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Or, if you're unlucky, those rare chests will be Mimics who will proceed to eat you</span>, containing random weapons, accessories, magic spells, and/or skill seals. If you're lucky, you'll come away with gear you wouldn't be able to nab for months, in-game. Works even better if you're trying to level up a low-level NPC (In a high-enough level dungeon, they'll level up with each defeated enemy).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade">Xenoblade</a></em> gives us Bionis' Leg. Besides the regular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">mooks</a>, the game lets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mooks</a> over 50 levels higher than the regular ones roam most areas. Generally you're just supposed to avoid them until you're much, MUCH later on the game, but on Bionis' Leg is possible to take down a few of these by having Melia put the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook">Elite Mook</a> to sleep with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">Hypnotize</a>, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">pushing it off a cliff</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnockBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnockBack">Spear Break</a>. The end result: Loads of experience and lategame equipment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SummonNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SummonNight">Summon Night</a>: <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordcraftStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordcraftStory">Swordcraft Story</a></em> has floors 24-28 of the main dungeon. While you can access them on day 7, you aren't required to go till day 10 (7, 8 and 9 take place in separate dungeons), and the enemies, which aren't that much tougher than before, give enough experience to easily gain ~15 levels before you stop gaining the bonus for being lower level than the enemies, the otherwise annoyingly rare but necessary Mystic Ore is relatively common and the boxes there give great materials for crafting.
</li><li> There's a notorious one in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateIIThroneOfBhaal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateIIThroneOfBhaal">Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal</a></em>, in which you reach the ramparts of a city that's being attacked by giants. By equipping infinite-ammunition bows, setting those with them to attack automatically, and telling anyone without one not to attack, you can reach the level cap <em>without even being at your computer</em>.
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">first installment</a>, you have the Pirate's cave. Every time you rest in the cave, you'll be attacked by Flesh Golems.
</li></ul></li><li> About halfway through <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenTierkreis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenTierkreis">Suikoden Tierkreis</a></em>, you can reach the bottom floor of Grayridge Mine. Most of the enemies are the same low-level ones that don't give you much in the way of rewards, but every so often you'll run into the miniboss "Fanged Silkmoth," which is absurdly high level. What makes this good for gaining levels instead of getting killed is that it's vulnerable to the Sleep Freeze line of spells, which you conveniently just got access to when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMiniMoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMiniMoe">Manaril</a> joined. Once it's asleep, you can take it out in one shot with Gadburg's Spark command. The same area also connects to a corner of Mt. Svatgol, a late-game area where you can pick up a ton of expensive item drops and recruit a character early.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NiNoKuni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NiNoKuni">Ni no Kuni</a></em> has Swan Island, a small island north of the early game continent you can access the moment you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetOnTheBoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetOnTheBoat">Get on the Boat</a>. It's kind of a gimmick area, as all the enemies here are of the various species of Familiar you get given automatically at early points in the story. (They can't be found anywhere else) Except one, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MyNeighborTotoro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MyNeighborTotoro">Tokos.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime">They run from you on the world map, and will run in battle if given the chance, but give 2002 exp when defeated</a>, when the most exp you're getting from regular battles at this point is around 150. With a bit of luck you can easily turn your party into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiskOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiskOneNuke">Disk One Nuke</a> here.
<ul><li> Later on once you get Tengri the dragon as your transportation, you can get to the place north of the Tombstone Trail and go to a place named Perdida. You can go inside the city for bookmarking purposes but the guard won't let you in until a certain point. That's fine because outside Perdida, you get to encounter the slightly more powerful version of the Tokos named Tokotoko. Still has the same gimmicks as the Tokos, but if you're lucky, you could encounter <em>two of them in one battle</em>. One already gives out at least <em>8000 EXP</em>; do the math.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfXillia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfXillia">Tales of Xillia</a></em> has the Xagut Floodmeadow. It becomes available very early in the game (around 10% of the way through) and features enemies of a level more appropriate to the halfway mark. They'll likely wipe your party without much trouble even on Easy at the time you get there, but by the time you can fight them (albeit with some difficulty) they'll still give around triple the experience and money of level-appropriate encounters, as well as some valuable item drops. What really makes the area great, though, is the loot farming. In addition to a few chests with rare items, there are respawning harvest points that contain loot of a much higher level than anything else nearby, allowing a player skilled at dodging enemy encounters to make an average of 3-4 thousand gald per minute in money and items, at a point in the game where a party with 30-40k is pretty rich. Between the money and the shop upgrades, it's easy to acquire high level gear that makes Hard and Unknown difficulties substantially more manageable.
<ul><li> The Old Vicalle Mine has some spindly enemies called Gentlegnomes. Three of them give 1500 experience and have good drops and stealables worth great amounts for shop expansion. Adding some spicy chicken rolls grants that fight 3000 experience, enough to level up your characters in one battle each time till level 40 and still good enough to level up till 50 rather quick. Only possible after Chapter 2 starts and you have a full party, and are at least level 25+ already with decent equipment.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss">Tales of the Abyss</a></em> has a minor example in the icy continent of Sylvana. The party is actually forced to stop there pretty early in the game (stopping there just after the 10% or so mark that is Akzeriuth is passed), but the monsters are levelled for just under the halfway point in the game. Like the similar example in <em>Xillia</em> above, it'll be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> unless you're prepared.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Off" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Off">Off</a></em> has Purified Zones. They are home to only one kind of enemy: the Secretaries (each zone has its own kind, varying in power depending on the zone's level). Secretaries are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Demonic Spiders</a> of the worst kind, but give massive amounts of experience and often drop health-restoring and resurrecting items. If your party is strong enough to defeat at least one group of them, it is possible to run in circles around a savespot until you encounter Secretaries, kill them, go to the savespot for health replenishment, rinse and repeat. While <em>Off</em> combat is not very hard and level grinding is not at all necessary to beat the game, if you want to see the high-level moves (like Ultimate Homerun) in action, you'll have to spend a couple of hours grinding Zone 3 Secretaries.
</li><li> The portal sidequest in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ArcanumOfSteamworksAndMagickObscura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ArcanumOfSteamworksAndMagickObscura">Arcanum: Of Steamworks &amp; Magick Obscura</a></em>. The portal is spewing monsters into the forest around Blackroot, and you're encouraged to disable it from a safe distance with either a magickal trap or a scroll of magick dispersal. But if your character is powerful enough, or you have a good selection of followers, you can bait the monsters into attacking you, kill them, and the portal will spawn more (though it will eventually run out). The monsters in question aren't usually encountered until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">The Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a>, and can be a good source of XP early on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Robopon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Robopon">Robopon</a></em> has this. In particular, the waves in front of Vanza Village can carry you for at least a dozen levels early on, and the well in Cools Town is also useful.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gothic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gothic">Gothic</a> II</em>: The battering ram near the wall of the Old Camp. You can walk on it, but the surrounding orcs can't. However, you can still reach them with your weapons. Cue the player running around the entire Orc encampment, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishingForMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishingForMooks">luring small groups of orcs near the ram</a> and slaughtering them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IcewindDale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IcewindDale">Icewind Dale</a></em>: A good place is Dragon's Eye, level 3. Resting will trigger a chance to respawn monsters that are easily beaten for thousands of XP points.
</li><li> Xanantos' fortress in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lunarosse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lunarosse">Lunarosse</a></em> gives out a surprisingly high amount of cash and EXP with relatively easy foes. Until the final or hidden dungeons open up, it's the best spot to grind.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OracleOfAskigaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OracleOfAskigaga">Oracle Of Askigaga</a></em>: There's barely any grinding in this game as it's possible to gain 30 levels in 30 minutes from grinding in the final temple.
</li><li> The entire rest of the world can technically become this once you acquire the Bat Transformation spell in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VampiresDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VampiresDawn">Vampires Dawn</a></em>. While the main quest will tell you where to go, nothing is restricting you from accessing any other point in the world. Typically, at least German walkthroughs will even advice training on the starting continent first before heading for the snow-covered island in the north-east to face some slightly-stronger opponents for easy EXP gain.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BravelySecond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BravelySecond">Bravely Second</a></em> features a series of small islands between Eternia and Eisen that, while unreachable by sailing due to a lack of shoals, can be landed on once <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> your ship, the Rubadub, becomes an airship in Chapter 4.</span> While there's nothing of real importance on the islands, they are considered part of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Caldisla Region</span>, which is hidden and inaccessible until Chapter 6 and will spawn enemies of an according level. Combined with the chain battle system, a well-prepared party can burn through Experience and Job levels very quickly, and being on the overworld makes safety saves and retreat for healing a breeze.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Alphadia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Alphadia">Alphadia</a></em> opens access to several end-game dungeons as soon as the party obtains its ship. While the characters are barred from going very far inside- either by locked doors or the party commenting they have no business there- there's still enough room to move back and forth to encounter the monsters inside.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlphadiaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlphadiaGenesis">Alphadia Genesis</a></em> has one island where the random encounter enemies are of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime">Metal Slime</a> variety and accessories that always guarantee a critical hit. Throw in Corone's experience-boosting skill and the experience-boosting formation and it's entirely possible for the party to reach maximum level in half an hour.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AsdivineHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AsdivineHearts">Asdivine Hearts</a></em> has two overworld maps. Both of them contain one island each of nothing but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime">Metal Slime</a> enemies, and the first one becomes available 1/3 of the way through the game, making it entirely possible to gain enough levels to deliver a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> to nearly every remaining random encounter in the main game!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SagaFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SagaFrontier">SaGa Frontier</a></em>: The Bio Research Lab in Shrike and the Yorkland Swamp will always have the enemy levels surpassing your party's current battle levels. While they can cause easy game overs, they make ideal places to raise your stats or gain new powerful techniques.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RadiaSenkiReimeihen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RadiaSenkiReimeihen">Radia Senki Reimeihen</a></em> has Rema Desert, an area meant to be accessed three-quarters through the game that can easily be accessed in the first quarter. The flying enemies encountered right near the entrance not only have the best EXP of any enemy encounter up to that point, but also significantly lower HP compared to other enemies in the area. With enough Techs to do 400 points of damage, you can effortlessly defeat a group of five for 125 EXP, roughly <em>ten times</em> what you would obtain from enemies in the previous areaand then return to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInn">Trauma Inn</a> right near the entrance to the Rema Desert to restore your Techs and repeat as desired.
</li><li> In the H-game <em>Lust Grimm</em>, there's an area where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestMonster">Mimics</a> appear as respawning enemies (Mimics outside this area don't respawn). If you're powerful enough to reliably defeat Mimics, this is a good way to get experience and money.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TheLegendOfDragoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TheLegendOfDragoon">The Legend of Dragoon</a></em>, there's Nest of Dragon, Snowfield, and Home of Gigantos for grinding Additions as all three have an area to fully heal your party for free. For grinding levels, there's the area between Home of Gigantos area and the Valley of Corrupted Gravity. Home of Gigantos has an enemy that sometimes drops a Satchel which can be used to instantly kill the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime">Blue Birds</a> nearby for a thousand experience each.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile">Valkyrie Profile</a></em> features the Tower of Lezard Valeth, which opens up in the fourth chapter (of 8). The first time going through, it is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultySpike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultySpike">Difficulty Spike</a> compared to the rest of the chapter, but with proper use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">Elemental RockPaperScissors</a>, the enemies are manageable. That said, its experience yield is the greatest up until chapter seven due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel">the sheer size of the dungeon and the number of monsters therein</a>, and players who know the ins and outs of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting">Item Crafting</a> via transmutation in this game can get the materials for multiple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Infinity -1 equipment</a> from foes. Subsequent runs typically involve three level 1 characters building up a combo so that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredPartyMember">Lenneth Valkyrie</a> can cut loose with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPolykill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPolykill">One-Hit Polykill</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Purify Weird Soul</a>. Particularly on Hard Mode, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardModePerks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardModePerks">all recruited characters start at level 1 and can thus benefit more from equipment that gives boosts upon leveling</a>, it's pretty much <em>the</em> first stop when training a new character, whether it be to use or just to buff up before sending them to Valhalla for Odin's sake.
</li><li> Several exist in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GirlsFrontline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GirlsFrontline">Girls Frontline</a></em>, but 0-2 is the most popular out of them all, due to being unlocked rather early as well as optimal for dolls at level 80-100, which require exponentially more EXP to level up than at lower levels. Not only that, since the optimal leveling route also grants S Rank victory, it's pretty common to obtain 3-star or rarer dolls from running the map, who then can be retired for cores.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder10');">    Turn Based Strategy </div><div class="folder" id="folder10" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Since the ultimate goal of a lot of players in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea">Disgaea</a></em> series is to make characters as ridiculously strong as possible, many try to look for places to very quickly power-level. The go-to place in each game is usually a specific stage of the Cave/Hall/Mount of Ordeals, which has to be unlocked by passing a bill in the Dark Assembly. The stage usually has high level enemies on an EXP (and sometimes Mana) boosting Geo Panel, all placed in a specific pattern (often 3x3) so that one strong AoE attack (usually magic or the Big Bang fist skill) can take them all out very quickly. Boost the enemy levels in the Dark Assembly and use EXP boosting Innocents, and suddenly, the player's characters are jumping thousands of levels (in some cases, going from lv 1 to lv 9999 in <em>two battles</em>). However, getting that specific stage may require dealing with a couple of annoying stages beforehand.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaHourOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaHourOfDarkness">Disgaea</a></em>, one level has all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeoEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeoEffects">Geo Effects</a> that make everyone on the stage but one square invincible. By throwing enemies on top of each other, you can create a level 100 enemy to whittle down for great EXP gain. The same chapter is also good for building weapon levels, as you can freely have your troops attack each other without concern.
</li><li> The PSP and DS releases has an even better place. After clearing the Demonhall Mirror, you get a stage similar to Cave of Ordeals 3. Except the enemies are higher level, higher rank, and the EXP bonus is +100% instead of +50%. You'll spend a bit of time there.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea2CursedMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea2CursedMemories">Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories</a>,</em> one chapter has enemies that level endlessly if left alone (thanks to a Geo Effect), you can then capture them once they are twice the level of your highest leveled character (leave him in your base), then repeat, doubling the level you can capture each go until you have a level 9999 character, then use it in a combo to kill other level 9999 characters, giving massive level gains to the other people in the combo. (Note: This has been patched for rereleases. Now you can't capture monsters with a level above the protagonist's.)
<ul><li> More fun <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a>: The Dark World version of a late stage has a bunch of geo effects that buff your party, the most important of which is an ATK+ 1 effect; the Dark Sun also respawns enemies every couple of turns, so as long as you're not bored you can just sit there and kill your enemies ad infinitum.
</li><li> And there are plenty of areas with Exp X 3 effects.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea3AbsenceOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea3AbsenceOfJustice">Disgaea 3: Absence of Justice</a></em> has a map in Chapter 7 that is just a ordinary battle when played for the first time, but once it's beaten, it changes into a field with 9 mushroom-like enemies sitting in panels that boost their experience and mana given. And by passing four Stronger Enemies bills, they will be at Lv. 99, which makes them award as much experience as a Lv. 320 enemy<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4u74a');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4u74a" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4u74a');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The experience that enemies give is proportional to their "to next level" experience, which is the highest it can be since enemies start at 0% of the way to the next level. The experience formula switches from level 99 to 100, making it take about triple the experience to get from 99 to 100 as 98 to 99, and the jump from 100 to 101 actually take slightly less exp than 98 to 99. Thus enemies at exactly level 99 will award roughly triple the experience of monsters that are around but not exactly level 99.</span>. Roughly a half hour there will net the player millions of HL and boost their levels to 300 range, making the rest of the story a breeze.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea4APromiseUnforgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea4APromiseUnforgotten">Disgaea 4: A Promise Unforgotten</a></em> did the exact same thing: one of the Chapter 9 levels feature a normal battle when played once but by playing the map again will have the same mushroom enemies sitting in exp and mana boosting grounds. Passing the Stronger Enemies bill once will have their levels increased to 99, and the same experience loophole can be exploited.
<ul><li> As early as Chapter 5 unveils a similar map, with one key difference — Desco, when turned giant via merging with another monster, is the only one who can hit the entire enemy team at the same time. It's incredibly easy to get Desco to around level 500 without any real work, making the rest of the game trivial.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaDimension2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaDimension2">Disgaea Dimension 2</a> A Brighter Darkness</em>, the cheat shop (which allows you to increase both enemy levels <em>and</em> EXP growth.) can make many story maps one, but 6-1 most of all. Simply change the enemies' level to 99 and use tower attacks and you'll be at level 400-700 in a few minutes. More than enough to blaze trough the rest of the game.
</li></ul></li><li> One early level in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FrontMission1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FrontMission1">Front Mission 1</a></em> provides a unique opportunity for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a>; Lloyd's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> Driscoll is on the map and piloting an extremely powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a>, and the game <em>expects</em> you to destroy the rest of the enemies while keeping your distance from him. However, Driscoll begins the level on a raised area that he needs to leave before engaging your squad, and his mech is fitted exclusively with short range weapons. By correctly positioning your squad, you can trap him in the raised area in a way that prevents him from attacking you, and any members of your squad equipped with long range bazookas can then chip away at his armor until they max out their long range skills. Also, if you destroy his mech's arms, he loses the ability to attack you and you can safely use him for target practise with your short-range weapons as well.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantomBrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantomBrave">Phantom Brave</a></em> similar to the <em>Disgaea 2</em> example above, there is an early level where one enemy is under the effect of Level+ 1 - but its current Hit Points don't increase. If you are far enough away from it, you can let it level an enormous number of times before letting any character with a decent attack stat and item kill it for huge amounts of EXP.
<ul><li> For a more certain level-up, there's an ability that allows a newly confined spirit to damage everything around him immediately (called Big Bang). It's a simple matter to fuse a spirit who has this ability to any spirit you want to power level, give Marona a slowing piece of equipment, wait for the little guy to reach lvl. 9999, throw the equipment next to him, confine the spirit, and BANG! Instant Lvl. 100 (or more, once you increase the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">Cap</a>).
</li><li> The "Failure" title. Attach it to a high-leveled Random Dungeon, and then BOOM! All enemies in that dungeon are 80% weaker, yet all items in the dungeon still give out experience according to their level. Yes, destroying items gives you XP.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em>
<ul><li> The Tower of Valni in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones">The Sacred Stones</a></em> is a good place to train, but the chests and dropped items are also fairly valuable. Furthermore, you can exit and reenter at any time, and the boss Entombed of the first floor doesn't move, has no ranged weapon, and gives out a full 100 experience (one level-up) for landing the killing blow, even to a level 19 promoted unit. Also, there's a chance of extra Entombed spawning, which will give out <em>almost</em> as much EXP as the boss (and far more than the non-Entombed enemies on the same level).
</li><li> It seems the dev team realised how popular Entombed were for grinding: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">DLC</a> chapter consisting of <em>nothing but Entombed.</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However, if you just rush in and start attacking them, you'll be in for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack">nasty surprise</a>...</span>
</li><li> In just about every game, there's at least one enemy that has this particular setup: A. They are stuck standing in a particular spot such as a castle entrance, throne, etc. B. said spot heals them and C. they lack ranged attacks or said attacks can be disabled. Due to the fact that the games reward experience simply for hitting a enemy or healing an ally this means that it's easy to park a ranged character a couple spaces away, nail the enemy with an attack, wait for it to regenerate its health, then repeat for as long as the character's stock of ranged weapons hold out. If the enemy does have a ranged attack, parking a melee exclusive character with high defense a couple spaces away and having the healers repeatedly heal said character makes it just as easy to level healers — and then eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons">the enemy's weapon will break</a>, and you can use the other strategy from then on.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StellaGlow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StellaGlow">Stella Glow</a></em> may be the only game to have this trope listed on its <em>character</em> page. The Earth Witch, Mordimort is battled before she joins your party at the climax of Chapter 5, and she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMaker">Mook Maker</a> with no limit to how long she can go. Furthermore, once she joins, her Shadows during Tuning are also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMaker">Mook Makers</a>. In all three of these battles, the mooks' levels scale to the average of your party's level, so you won't even run into issues with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiGrinding">Anti-Grinding</a> and can easily use these fights to power-level...though by the circumstances, Mordi herself can't benefit from any of these fights.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VandalHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VandalHearts">Vandal Hearts</a></em> you can use the healing circles in the Castle Ruins to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">level up faster than the developers had in mind</a>. Simply move your bishops in the healing circles and have them cast bless weapon on each other. In about 1 and a half hours they'll be at level 70 (the level cap for the game.) Next have the unit that sustained the highest damage find and use the iron boot on your level 70 bishop. Now watch said unit gains 50+ levels. Now you can let all your other units heal that damaged unit with herbs. Congratulations, most of your units will now be at level 60+. Just be careful. The monsters in the bonus levels will be at the same level as Ashe, so you may not want to level him up like this.
</li><li> With a lot of patience, players are capable of leveling both Kouta and to a lesser extent, Raul, Fiona, and Despinis in chapter 37 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsOriginalGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsOriginalGeneration">2nd Original Generation</a></em>. For Kouta, all you just need is to have his Ace Bonus, a Dust-proof device, and pump up his skill and melee stats, give him some ability parts, and some pilot skills to help boost his attacks, and watch as Jin Rai <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> go down in one hit with his free cost attack, Spiral Knuckle, after getting his Compatible Kaiser. In a few hours, you get a lot of money, a lot of pilot points, and a lot of levels for Kouta. For the Excellence team's case, you can have Fiona cast Bless on the Excellence Rescue, resupply the Compatible Kaiser (as the machine debuts with a low EN) and watch as you get 800 EXP for that one scenario (as you have only 8 turns to finish that part of the scenario and it's an instant game over if you fail that chapter). The only thing bad about this trick is that if Kouta kills too many enemies, the game will crash. Fortunately, if you do get a game over, you get to keep all the money, pilot point skills, and kills that you accumulated throughout the entire stage and thus lets you redo it all over again at the cost of one Battle Mastery point.
</li><li> The <em>War of the Chosen</em> DLC for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2">XCOM 2</a></em> adds a new enemy type to the game: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent">the Lost</a>, an endlessly respawning horde of walking target dummies that tend to go down in one shot. Now if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">Random Number God</a> is merciful and spawns you a mission with the "The Horde" sitrep (which also tend to not have a time limit), you can just ignore your mission objective in favor of digging in and shooting zombies ad infinitum. Every dead Lost counts as a full kill, and even though your soldiers can only be promoted once per mission, you can rack up so many kills this way they'll reach the rank of colonel in no time.
