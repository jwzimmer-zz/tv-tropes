While such soldiers of fortune are regarded with wariness in most settings, they're generally considered distinct from criminal enforcers, mafia hit men, and the like. The polar opposite of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conscription" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conscription">conscripts</a>.
</p><p>In the real world, they are usually ex-soldiers with decent to slightly-above-average equipment from the United States — the largest company, and largest number of companies, are American. Other common national backgrounds are former Soviet Republics or South Africa. Of course, there are plenty of less professional and less affluent outfits out there, some of which will hire just about anyone who'll take them up on their offer. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit">It's a great summer job!</a> In fiction, though, they tend to get all the latest and most expensive vehicles and support equipment as well, and are often recruited and trained by the company itself. Fictional mercenary groups often hire unique individuals or groups of various special types of fighters: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja">Ninja</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ronin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ronin">ronin</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Samurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Samurai">samurai</a>, dishonored <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">knights</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic">mages</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">shapeshifters</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant">left-over warriors of defeated organizations, nations, or races</a> that need to make ends meet.

If they get <em>too</em> enthusiastic about their job, they may become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knights</a> and try to start a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit">War for Fun and Profit</a>. On the other hand, they do have to deal with the risk of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">their employers double-crossing them when the job's done</a>. And if their clients run out of money before the fighting's done, things will get ugly in short order in one or more of many ways.
</p><p>In recent years, there's come to be a distinction between a "<em>mercenary company</em>" and "<em>corporate mercenaries</em>", especially in Western (American) television and movies. The traditional mercenary who hires <em>himself</em> out (or himself and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">a dozen of his best buddies</a>) is seen as somewhat honest, with at least a personal code of honor of some kind (even if it's just "do the job, get paid"); determined to accomplish the mission for which he has been paid and takes his reputation very seriously; and is scrappy yet skilled. This character is usually played moderately sympathetic, or at least as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antihero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antihero">antihero</a>. They will typically have some attention given to their, quite possibly colorful, personalities.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>In stark contrast, the "<em>corporate mercenary</em>" is usually just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mook</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirt</a> of some kind, and the "character" takes the form of the PMC corporation itself. Corporate mercs are usually depicted as being up to no good, or are the hand-puppets of some shadowy organization which is itself up to no good. They are portrayed — when anything more than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessGoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessGoons">Faceless Goons</a> — as amoral, ethically challenged, and professional but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyMasterRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyMasterRightOrWrong">hardly ever inclined to argue with Corporate Headquarters</a>. If former military, many will have been dishonorably discharged. Unless the writer's bent on defying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsAMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsAMook">What Measure Is a Mook?</a>, they will almost never be the "good guys" in recent years. Their parent company usually has a name based loosely or thematically on "Blackwater" in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed">No Celebrities Were Harmed</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of that real-life PMC — examples include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KnightRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KnightRider">"Blackriver"</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheBoys">"Red River"</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheUnit">"Blackthorne"</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAYTheHeist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAYTheHeist">"Murky</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2">water"</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">"Starkwood"</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution">"Bluewater"</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueDetective">"Black Mountain"</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest">"Silverpool"</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">"Merryweather"</a>.
</p><p>Note that although this trope description uses the terms "PMC" and "mercenaries" interchangeably, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> the distinction between them is extremely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a>. This is because the international treaties that establish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLawsAndCustomsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLawsAndCustomsOfWar">The Laws and Customs of War</a> explicitly <em>forbid</em> the usage of mercenaries in warfare. While traditional mercenaries might be tolerated in <em>practice</em>, legally they are neither lawful combatants nor non-combatants, and thus aren't eligible for protection and respectful treatment under, for example, the Geneva conventions. When captured, they are treated as a criminal gang at best, and at worst as complete outlaws.
</p><p>Private military contractors are the way that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">some people</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer">try to weasel out</a> of this ban on mercenaries. Even though the largest of these companies employ materiel that is ordinarily associated purely with the military — armor, helicopters, light warships — <em>on paper</em>, they are just your garden-variety mall guards writ large, and they are not authorized to wage war on their own. Officially, these units may be employed only in some duties not involving actively engaging the enemy (though they can do this if forced), such as escorting convoys and guarding some civilian structures. In practice this mandate could be, and often is interpreted <em>very</em> broadly — "While you're on patrol, don't go and get into a fight with the insurgents at yonder hill three klicks to the southwest, but if they fire first, or if you see anything indicating a possible threat, then by all means, do whatever you must." Note that not all PMCs necessarily are thinly disguised mercenaries; a private military contractor is any non-government organization contracted by the military, which may include as mundane things as a contract to make and serve food for an army in peacetime.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> PMCs run the gamut from dirty-working <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiredGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiredGuns">Hired Guns</a> outfits to highly scrupled organizations with very strict rules about what they will and won't do, and for whom. Some PMCs provide armed security for Christian (and occasionally Muslim) charities in war-torn regions like Darfur (the contractors who do this kind of work often give their clients a discount rate—it's charity, after all). Others patrol African elephant habitats hunting heavily armed ivory poachers. Even those who take corporate contracts are much more likely to be doing "rent-a-cop" work making sure nobody blows up a pipeline than "massacre uncooperative village" jobs (although that does sometimes happen). Some PMCs are good people doing good work for good reasons (and making a living doing it). Others are willing to work for drug cartels. It is a very large and diverse category that probably shouldn't be painted with a broad brush, good or bad.
</p><p>Another example that is much common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> but very rare in fiction<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0vh9l');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0vh9l" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0vh9l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em>The Washington Post</em> estimates there are 1,931 private intelligence companies working for the US government, while actual PMCs can be counted on your fingers.</span> are <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_intelligence_agency">Private Intelligence Agencies<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. This sector boomed after 9/11 so much that many functions that were once held by the likes of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CIA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CIA">CIA</a> or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NSA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NSA">NSA</a> are being outsourced to third-party contractors. To show how much power and importance they now have, Edward Snowden, who leaked thousands of documents on the NSA's global surveillance program, was not a NSA agent but actually employed by <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booz_Allen_Hamilton">Booz Allen Hamilton<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</p><p>This is a classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotDevice">Plot Device</a> in tabletop games in general. Whether they're sword-swinging fantasy adventurers, Wild West bounty hunters or futuristic mercenaries, a time-honored means of getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacters">Player Characters</a> involved in a plot is to have someone hire them to accomplish some task or another.
</p><p>A PMC can provide a villainous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilArmy">Evil Army</a> if one doesn't actually want to insult any real country's Armed Forces.

</p><p>Mercenaries are the basic, land-based version of this trope; at sea and in space, they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Privateer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Privateer">privateers</a> operating under letters of marque.

The Silver Daggers' charter was guaranteed to last in perpetuity due to a boon posthumously granted to their original captain by Maryn I, so instead a law was passed banning all other mercenary units, and prohibiting the Silver Daggers from acting as a single unit ever again, forcing anyone who wanted a mercenary army to hire them one or two at a time — assuming that they could find enough of the now scattered soldiers of fortune to make it worth the effort.

While Drake mostly uses them to tell stories based on historical events, their mercenary nature plays an important role in their characterization. In the series background, war has become so very expensive that mercenaries are common, and usually the most competent soldiers. The Slammers interact with other mercenary companies and are sometimes shortchanged by their employers. At other times, they play both sides off against each other.

He first captured the planet of New Postdam (though considering that the planetary microorganisms ate chlorophyll, the inhabitants were happy to be captured by anyone who could clean up their planet and give them enough to eat), then went on to build an empire from there (at least partially financed by organizing and hiring out mercenary companies).

For example, Vorsha worked as a mercenary — until her employer decided that outlawing her company on trumped-up charges beat paying them. And, if Herad plays her cards right, her band could well function as a decidedly murky company of these, too. She's already made one or two shady deals with lords which lean in this direction.

Most of the time, they're hired to help keep the monster population under control. Since Eric is a novice in this book, he is only hired to do grunt work.

Furthermore, the entire setting is based on a pun regarding the word "band:" Mercenary bands are treated exactly like rock bands, with tours, frontmen, bookers, gigs, and of course money and fame.

Each sellsword company has its own name, style and reputation, ranging from the motley and brutal Brave Companions (disparaged as "the Bloody Mummers") to the elite and greatly respected Golden Company. While sellswords are rather notorious for their fickle loyalty and tendency to flee if battles turn sour or the pay runs dry (the only exception being the Golden Company, who make it a point of honor to never break a contract), they are generally regarded as competent warriors. Jaime notes that, unlike many wealthy knights of Westeros, sellswords must survive by their skill at arms alone. Some sellswords can grow quite rich and elevate their social position, the most notable being Bronn, who becomes a knight and marries into a noble family.
</li><li> There is another type of mercenary called a "freerider", which is less defined in the books but explained by the author as a mercenary with a horse who attaches himself to an army free of charge and takes his pay in booty after the battle.
</li><li> Sellsails are mercenary sailors in it mainly for the loot: buccaneers, basically. Salladhor Saan is a notable example, a wealthy pirate who hires out his fleet to Stannis Baratheon. The Iron Isles, the Sisters and the Stepstones have a semi-steady side-gig of selling the use of whole flotillas or fleets. When they aren't going full-pirate, that is.
</li><li> Hedge knights are landless knights who hire themselves out to landed knights or lords to fight in their armies. While granted an air of respectability by their title and the oaths they swear, they are effectively just elite mercenaries.

And they have access to the same methods and technology that the other ghost projecting firms do, so they can deal with supernatural issues or exploit spiritual abilities and loopholes to get the job done. They're even hired at one point by a mysterious third party to take out Orpheus Group, which they do with great success, and continue to ruthlessly hound the survivors and remnants afterward because their client didn't technically tell them when to stop.

It also doesn't object to hiring out a squadron to each side in a conflict; since pilots in Guild warbirds are likely to survive going down, as long as it's making more from the clients than it's spending on replacement planes, it's satisfied.

A.I.M. seems to work as more of a mercenary union/guild rather than a PMC, as members are hired on an individual basis and bring just themselves plus their starting equipment if you chose to pay for it, leaving you to provide any other equipment, further training and transportation within the area of operations.
<ul><li> <em>Jagged Alliance 2</em> would introduce the More Economic Recruiting Center (M.E.R.C.) as an alternate provider with its own membership. The locals who can be recruited for dirt-cheap salaries (with stats to match) and the rebels (who are seconded to your force without pay) are <em>not</em> mercenaries, however.

</li><li> In-game, many of the antagonists you end up fighting are also mercenaries. Lucas' red-shirt wearing goons in the first game are all mercenaries he's hired to wrest control of the fallow trees, and Deidrianna's troops in the third are an even mixture of fanatically loyal soldiers, conscripts, and mercenaries. As the game progresses, Deidrianna begins to rely more and more on professional mercenaries to make up for the fact that many of her people are rebelling and her poorly-trained and poorly-armed conscripts have been regularly slaughtered by your own mercs.

In a decidedly odd subversion of the "not allowed to make war" deal, the PMCs are specifically fighting each other to prove that their group is more capable of defending the objective...from other PMCs (technically, the concern is terrorists, but the PMCs are the most frequent attackers). In other words, the PMCs are fighting and causing damage to the very things they're being hired to protect, so that they can be hired to protect it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> depicts various mercenary groups, such as the Blue Suns, Eclipse, and Blood Pack. These groups make up a significant portion of the second game's enemies, as it takes place in a region of space outside of Citadel jurisdiction.
<ul><li> Wrex in the first game was a mercenary and bounty hunter for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">centuries</a> before he teamed up with Shepard.
</li><li> Zaeed Massani is a mercenary, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the co-founder of the Blue Suns</span>, and one of the toughest characters in your party.
</li><li> Each of the three main companies has their own distinct style. Eclipse, for example, makes heavy use of asari Vanguards, salarian Engineers, and mechs. The Blue Suns use elite squads of heavily-armed human, turian, and batarian soldiers. The Blood Pack use regenerating vorcha and krogan troops, and a hefty amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">flamethrowers</a>.
</li><li> It's worth noting that in addition to standard PMC jobs, the majority of the mercenary organizations in the setting also run large-scale criminal enterprises as well. As a result, a lot of the mercenary groups are also effectively heavily-armed, militarized versions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">The Mafia</a>. In one neighborhood this is made explicit when a recording notes the Blue Suns regularly collected protection money. One notable subversion is the Talon mercenary unit from <em>Mass Effect 3: Omega</em>. Originally they were a small-time outfit on the eponymous station that was just as terrible as all the rest (but not as numerous). Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs">Cerberus invaded</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCape">Nyreen Kandros</a> seized on them as the core of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a>. By the time Shepard and Aria show up, the Talons are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHelpTheHelpless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHelpTheHelpless">more selfless</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy">disciplined</a> than some of the setting's actual standing armies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a>: Citadel</em> also has the CAT6 mercenaries, named after the Alliance's "Category 6" discharges (dishonorable discharges due to either substance abuse or mental stress). They're frighteningly well-equipped with customized Cerberus equipment, and are even stronger than the already-formidable soldiers they ape (because there are <em>millions</em> of Cerberus mooks, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjutsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjutsu">and only a few hundred of them</a>).
</li><li> Various minor groups are present in the background. One group consisting of a couple dozen armed thugs, the Grim Skulls, are wiped out by Saren Arterius in the <em>Mass Effect: Revelations</em> prequel novel. Another, the Grim Angels, was one of the <em>many</em> groups that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor">Zaeed Massani</a> ran with... they all died. Small groups like this act as the antagonists of several side missions in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a>, usually being so irrelevant that they don't even get names.
</li><li> Technically all of the multiplayer characters in <em>Mass Effect 3</em> are paid by the job. In some cases, they're serving members of an allied government (humans, turians, asari, salarians, geth, quarians) and paying them just simplifies the supply lines a little. In others, such as the batarians, vorcha, and volus, they're more motivated by the money than anything else.

Of course, in this case, "security work" includes deploying a battalion of tanks, a virtual air wing of helicopters, and over a thousand foot infantry, complete with military-grade air support. The scary part is that some real-life PMCs (i.e. Blackwater and Executive Outcomes) <em>could</em> match what UP's mercenaries do in-game.

<ul><li> A lot of modern military contractors, at least those operating in Western countries, are somewhat of a subversion of the trope in the sense that they are not really capable of doing what a real military does: they are more of glorified, heavy-duty security guards without the means to engage in "real" combat where heavy military equipment is involved. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> has a list of some of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_private_military_contractors">the most notable examples<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. This may be in part because of the United Nations Mercenary Convention, which prohibits the "recruitment, training, use, and financing of mercenaries". Using private military contractors for offensive operations would arguably be a violation of international law. However, China, France, India, Japan, Russia, the UK, and the US are not signatories to the treaty.

The firm, based in Africa, was responsible for several contracted wars, in which other firms that were owned by EO's parent company gained access to oil fields, diamond mines, and the like. Executive Outcomes folded in 1999, but the majority of its operators and equipment were shuffled around into other private military firms owned by the parent corporation. To add to the irony, while most of EO's members (at least initially) were ex-military of the Apartheid Era South Africa, one of their first clients was the anti-apartheid MPLA government of Angola against which they had fought during the Apartheid. EO was even pitted against their former allies, the UNITA rebels. Money is God indeed.

</li><li> As late as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, it was considered acceptable for officers to take a leave of absence to go off and fight in someone else's war, provided one didn't fight for one's own country's enemies or their allies. It was considered a valuable way to inject some combat experience into what would otherwise be a purely peacetime officer corps, as well as build up some goodwill on the sly, while still being technically a private venture, and as such completely deniable.
</li><li> In 19th and early 20th Century America, corporations would sometimes field a virtual army of mercenaries to break strikes and enforce their interests.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkertonDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkertonDetective">Pinkertons</a> were the most notorious and powerful example, to the point that they outgunned the U.S. military during the Homestead Strike, ultimately leading to the Anti-Pinkerton act in 1893.

They were primarily used as particularly brutal strike breakers but had full arrest powers on company property. They also served as political muscle for the large industrial interests, which was a factor (along with a number of assaults, rapes, and murders) that led to their disbanding by order of the governor in 1931. The Coal and Iron Police existed alongside the Pennsylvania State Police (which initially only had jurisdiction over rural areas) for 25 years but had more effective power prior to that date.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober">Russian Civil War</a> had various foreign mercenary units, sometimes formed from stranded POW or civilian workers and sometimes former Imperial regular units from seceded territories, who fought for the White and Red sides. The Reds had the Latvian Riflemen and the Chinese International Units. The Whites had the Czech Legion. Since the whole place and time was extremely lawless and unpleasant, most of them were just Bloody Mummers with guns.
</li><li> Foreign mercenaries were common in China between late 19th and early 20th centuries. With the regular armies in disarray, Qing government, at both national and local levels, hired numerous foreign mercenaries to lead its forces against various rebel forces. Some of these, such as American Frederick Townsend Ward, were genuine foreign adventurers seeking profit and adventure, while others, such as British Charles "Chinese" Gordon, were regular military officers instructed by their governments to help the Chinese government survive. After the empire fell and China was divided among numerous warlords, numerous foreign mercenaries were once again recruited to help these armies.
</li><li> The Medieval Italian <em>compagnia di ventura</em> or companies of adventure, which were basically private mercenary armies ready for any city state to hire. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the Italian city-states of Venice, Florence, and Genoa were very rich from their trade with the Levant, yet possessed woefully small national armies. In the event that foreign powers and envious neighbours attacked, the ruling nobles hired domestic and foreign mercenaries to fight for them. The military-service terms and conditions were stipulated in a <em>condotta</em> (contract) between the city-state and the soldiers (officer and enlisted man), thus, the contracted leader, the mercenary captain commanding, was titled the Condottiere. The mercenaries then formed private companies and armies which sold their services to the states. The condottiere armies got much criticism from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NiccoloMachiavelli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NiccoloMachiavelli">Niccolò Machiavelli</a>, but in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> they proved to be more competent than usually imagined. (Of course, Machiavelli's real concern wasn't so much with their effectiveness as fighters as the fact that the state's military force was a heavily armed gang loyal only to their last paycheck, thus creating instability; Machiavelli was also a big believer in the ability of a citizen-army to instill virtue in the population, so that had an effect as well. Basically, Machiavelli wanted a state to rely on its own people to fight its wars because they had skin in the game and because having the people defend the country encouraged patriotism.)
</li><li> Modern standing armies were originally collections of mercenary units under permanent contract to a given ruler (not always mercenaries strictly speaking; most were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyMasterRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyMasterRightOrWrong">lawful subjects</a> of the ruler, but they served under the same terms). They were usually raised privately by a local noble often from his neighbors. In fact much of the modern traditional ranking system was originally commercial in concept.<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass">Colonel</a> for instance originally meant "CEO of a <em>regimentum</em>(regiment), that is a mercenary band with a standing royal contract.
</li><li> For several hundred years, Swiss mercenaries were considered to be the finest soldiers in Europe. They even wore garish outfits so that everyone on the battlefield would know who they were. This is why the Vatican has the Swiss Guard, and why they wear such funny uniforms. Swiss mercenary companies would not fight an enemy force that included <em>another</em> Swiss mercenary company, so national loyalty was apparently more important than money in this case.
</li><li> Another famous Renaissance-era group of mercenaries were the German Landsknechts, who were modeled after and considered the primary rivals of Swiss mercenaries. The Landsknechts used a combination of halberds and pikes, much like the Swiss, but also employed a comparatively larger number of early firearms and artillery. They were also famous for the <em>zweihander</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">a sword that could be as long as six feet</a> designed to be used like a halberd to fend off multiple enemies and to obstruct enemy pikes. They did not share the Swiss's scruples about fighting their countrymen.
</li><li> Another common source of mercenaries during 17th and 18th centuries was Ireland. Most European Catholic nations during this period had a few units of Irishmen in their armies. This was actually encouraged by the British as every young Irish male with military skills remaining in Ireland was a potential rebel! Descendants of these Irish mercenaries would become heads of states in France (Patrice de MacMahon) and Chile (Bernardo O'Higgins) even before there was an independent Ireland.
</li><li> One common variation known was for a ruler of a small country to simply "rent out" his army to belligerents. These were not strictly mercenaries; the soldiers in them tended to be enlisted in the forces of their lawful prince. However someone enlisting would likely know what he was in for. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AllTheLittleGermanies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AllTheLittleGermanies">German states</a> were famous for this; their soldiers were such a good buy and their rulers so willing to deal, and they were often times not busy with a war on their own account as major powers were, and so could spare troops. This is the origin of the infamous "Hessian mercenaries" in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">The American Revolution</a>.
</li><li> For much of European history, especially in times when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor">Patriotic Fervor</a> was a smaller consideration, it was not considered dishonorable to fight in a foreign army as long as one does not fight against one's own government. When a petty-noble was left unemployed, he would often look for work for a foreign ruler. If he was promoted enough he might even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingNative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingNative">change countries</a> and be remembered in history more by the country he fought for then by the country he was born in.
<ul><li> Von Steuben was an example of one of these that took American service during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">The American Revolution</a>.
</li><li> John Paul Jones was a Scotsman (and <em>very much</em> anti-English at that), but is most famous for his service to Russian Empire and United States.
</li><li> Prince Eugene of Savoy was Italian but spent his life in the service of the Habsburg monarchy.
</li><li> Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoléon</a>, merely an Artillery captain at the time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">considered enlisting to the Russian Army</a> at one point, but decided against it so as not to lose seniority, because there was a mandatory rank penalty for the foreign officers at the time.
</li></ul></li><li> In the years leading up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a>, one of the French king's Household Cavalry regiments was known as "Le Royal Suedois" (The Royal Swedish) because all its officers and the bulk of its enlisted men were expatriate Swedes, while the infamous "Royal Allemand" used in the attempt to repress the riots of Paris had its officers and enlisted coming from Germany.
</li><li> The largest private armies in history were perhaps the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_armies">Presidency armies<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> employed by the Honorable East India Company of Great Britain, which essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneNationUnderCopyright" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneNationUnderCopyright">ruled the Indian subcontinent</a> for roughly a century. They were eventually nationalized (along with the rest of the EIC's infrastructure) in the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, itself triggered by a series of mutinies among the native soldiers.
</li><li> Another famous example is the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almogavars">Almogavars<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, infantry shock troops recruited all over the Iberian kingdoms with an origin in the Kingdom of Aragon who were feared for their ferocity and their <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarCry">War Cry</a>, "Awake, iron!", which they would shout as they struck their weapons with a piece of flint, making enormous sparks. A group of them led by Roger de Flor formed the Catalan Company, which was hired to help protect the Byzantine Empire, which they did with great success, but then their leaders were murdered by orders of the Emperor - which led to the Catalan Revenge, a two year long war of revenge and looting. The Almogavar survivors would later move to the Duchy of Athens, but after being denied their pay they went and conquered both the Duchies of Athens and Neopatras.
