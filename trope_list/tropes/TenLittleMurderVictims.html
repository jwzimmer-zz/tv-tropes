</p><p>Our heroes soon learn that one of their party is actually some manner of villain (typically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>, though a random escaped criminal is not unheard of), but, for various contrived reasons, that's all the information they're going to get. So it's up to them to work out which of their supposed colleagues is really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> before he can kill them all.

This can be self-imposed, as our heroes can't chance <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> reporting back to headquarters, but a character may force this upon everybody, which will usually raise everybody's tension. Circumstances will always contrive to prevent our heroes from getting in touch with the outside world to find out who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> is, which may range from the aforementioned storm knocking out the telephone poles, to someone cutting the telephone lines, to outright smashing all the phones to pieces. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AHouseDivided" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AHouseDivided">Accusations are hurled</a>, secrets are uncovered and more murders are committed as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DwindlingParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DwindlingParty">Dwindling Party</a> tries to determine who is the murderer in their midst.
</p><p>General outcomes of this plot:
</p><p></p><ul><li> A: One person will seem to actively hinder the investigation. He'll drop the radio, breaking it just before a description of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> is broadcast. He'll have a panic attack at a critical moment endangering the group. He'll be suspiciously uninformed about whatever his job is supposed to be. This person is <em>never</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerringMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerringMole">He's just an idiot.</a> (See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HanlonsRazor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HanlonsRazor">Hanlon's Razor</a>.)
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> B: One person knows his job well, but he's a little high-strung. He accuses a lot of people of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> on shaky grounds. If it doesn't turn out that <em>he's</em> the Mole (which is a little too obvious, and therefore rare), odds are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquittedTooLate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquittedTooLate">the real Mole's going to kill him</a>.
</li><li> C: One person is very competent and helpful. He'll even have some extra skills that are handy for just the room in which they are locked. He might even find clues as to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>'s identity. At some point, he'll save the hero's life. He's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>, and he's really very good at it.
</li><li> D: The idiotic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerringMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerringMole">Red Herring Mole</a> turns out to be a spy for the good guys. He's been keeping it a secret since, like everyone else, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DividedWeFall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DividedWeFall">he's not entirely sure that the mole isn't one of the heroes</a>. His apparent incompetence is really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a>, and he's trying to goad the <em>real</em> Mole into tipping his hand.
</li><li> E: There's a <em>second</em> mole—perhaps even one that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandVersusLeftHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandVersusLeftHand">the first mole doesn't know about</a>.
</li><li> F: <em>None</em> of them are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>: the initial message was a fabrication by the bad guys to make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DividedWeFall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DividedWeFall">the heroes turn on each other</a>.
</li><li> G: None of <em>them</em> are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>: the hero has been hypnotized to act as mole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent">without even his own knowledge</a>, or is simply an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a>.
</li><li> H: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> successfully frames someone else.
</li><li> I: <em>No one</em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>: for whatever reason, everyone's paranoia has spiraled completely out of control, causing them to attack each other on otherwise flimsy pretexts or misinterpreted accidents. Or the host, with the help of his staff and/or associates, faked it all to "entertain" his guest.
</li><li> J: Someone dies early, but they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">Never Found the Body</a>, or it was mutilated too badly to be positively identified: they are probably the Mole.
</li><li> K: No one is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>; the plot fits the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DwindlingParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DwindlingParty">Dwindling Party</a> twist, wherein the villain is someone else who simply kills most of the main characters, one by one and usually in an extremely brutal and sometimes grotesque manner. Perhaps the villain is a demented, deeply troubled individual, or is a stalker who enjoys killing; maybe he is a crime lord who fears being caught (and his method(s) of murder and carrying the killings out is used to put fear in others and/or intimidate the authorities)...or he is simply the face of evil (who also hopes to intimidate the heroes and scare off the authorities). Once the original gang is whittled down to just two or (at most) three, the villain is finally defeated; either the bad guy is killed, usually by falling into one of his own traps or another character—often but not always one thought to be dead—arriving to defeat him, the remaining protagonists are able to beat down the villain and subdue him until the authorities arrive to arrest him; or (most commonly on TV crime/action shows) the title character arriving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustInTime">Just in Time</a> before the villain kills the last remaining members of the group.
</li></ul><p>In a well-done example, the audience will work out who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> is only seconds before the heroes do, though they'll typically be led to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerringMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerringMole">incorrect guess</a> from early on.
</p><p>Non-recurring characters are subject to being killed off one-by-one by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>. Of course, strictly speaking, no one is above suspicion, even our heroes, and at least one member of the group will panic, accuse the heroes, and run off to a certain demise. The audience (usually) knows better.
</p><p>Named after the 1939 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie">Agatha Christie</a> novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndThenThereWereNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndThenThereWereNone">And Then There Were None</a></em> which was originally titled <em>Ten Little Niggers</em> and then renamed <em>Ten Little Indians</em> before arriving at its current name.
</p><p>Often the <em>modus operandi</em> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReunionRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReunionRevenge">Reunion Revenge</a>. Occasionally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalGirl">Final Girl</a> or other survivor(s) may be spared, but if the writers are really bloodthirsty, it only ends when they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a> (or, if you're at the beginning of the series, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodysDeadDave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodysDeadDave">Everybody's Dead, Dave</a>); if they're feeling devious, they may also throw in a few instances of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspectExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspectExistenceFailure">Suspect Existence Failure</a>. Newer installments may have this combined with/be the byproduct of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame">Deadly Game</a> Or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuntingTheMostDangerousGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuntingTheMostDangerousGame">Hunting the Most Dangerous Game</a> Scenario.

Don't be surprised if a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MexicanStandoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MexicanStandoff">Mexican Standoff</a> or two pop up, especially for the finale.

<div class="indent"><strong>Osaka:</strong> And then it turns out...I'm the killer! <br/><strong>Yomi:</strong> Why do <em>you</em> get to be the killer?
</div></li><li> One arc of the manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em> follows this trope's description to the letter, complete with large, dark mansion, gathering of wealthy guests, and the raging storm that means no one gets to go home. (And Ciel is most definitely fitting enough for the role of "mysterious host".) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out to be some bizarre, mind-boggling combination of E and I and involving one of the "victims" faking his own death</span>.
</li><li> One of the filler arcs from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> featured this.

</li><li> <em>Side:Future</em> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3">Danganronpa 3</a></em> features a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame">Deadly Game</a> as a major part of its plot. 16 people are locked inside a building and are injected with a potent sleeping drug every two hours. While everyone is asleep, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> gets to wake up early and kill whoever they want.

<ul><li> The entire premise of the board game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Clue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Clue">Clue</a></em>, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> based on it. The film involved a group of guests with questionable pasts being locked inside a mansion trying to figure out who killed Mr. Boddy. Every single one of them had a motive to kill him, and things aren't helped when the rest of the mansion's staff begins falling like flies...
<ul><li> The board game didn't initially include the element of the suspects being killed, but later releases did, adding a deck of cards that included eight clock cards: once the first seven had been drawn (and taken out of the deck), whoever drew the eighth card was killed by the murderer (presumably if the killed character is actually the murderer, they just faked their deaths instead) and the card was then returned to the deck.

<ul><li> "Ten Little Injuns" and numerous adaptations. The original "Ten Little Injuns" began as a minstrel song written by Septimus Winner in 1868, and describes a group of 10 Native Americans (here called by the derogatory term "injun") and, as different events happen—most of them dying of various circumstances—eventually decreasing down to one. The lone survivor ends up married. Various adaptations involve anthropomorphic animals (usually for family-friendly children's adaptations, although several of the original 10 still die or disappear of ambiguous circumstances), teddy bears and dolls, people (most often soldiers), and — in the racial sense — minorities.

</li><li> Parodied/subverted in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/DoctorWhoMagazine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/DoctorWhoMagazine">Doctor Who Magazine</a></em> comic strip, in which a group of minor villains that the Doctor has previously defeated gather together in a deserted space-station to plan a final attack that will finish him once and for all. One of them dies horribly, and as the others begin dying one by one afterward, it seems (to them, anyway) as if the Doctor has infiltrated their midst in disguise and is picking them off one by one. Finally, the last couple—paranoid that either one of them could be the Doctor in disguise—kill each other...and at that point, the Doctor arrives, not recognizing any of them. Turns out the first death was just an accident with a faulty machine and the other deaths were just everyone picking each other off out of sheer paranoia.

</li><li> The film adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clue">Clue</a></em> was essentially a gigantic parody of this trope.

Stallone was one of 9 cops being treated for psychological problems at a remote ranch in snowy Wyoming. However, one of the other patients was actually a serial killer who targets cops, having killed the real patient and assumed his identity. The real killer turned out to be the character who was most apparently helpful and mature (as opposed to the cowardly guy or the violent alcoholic).
</li><li> A very straight example in the first <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EkoEkoAzarak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EkoEkoAzarak">Eko Eko Azarak</a></em> Japanese film, where students are magically trapped inside a school and being killed off one by one.
</li><li> Another alien-invasion movie example: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFaculty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFaculty">The Faculty</a></em>; the humans who have not (yet) been taken over by alien parasites regard each other with suspicion and must figure out who in their number has fallen under alien control...but more than that, they must determine which person has actually been an alien all along. Not really surprisingly, the one who is an alien rather than an alien-controlled human is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the "new girl", who has been giving the other students a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory">Back Story</a> they've had to take on faith, rather than having a known history in their community</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticVoyage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticVoyage">Fantastic Voyage</a></em> establishes that at least one of the crew of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBoat">the Proteus</a> may be a Soviet agent sent to finish the assassination attempt on the scientist the mission is meant to cure.

</li><li> The Bollywood movie <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Bollywood/Gumnaam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Bollywood/Gumnaam">Gumnaam</a></em> is an uncredited remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndThenThereWereNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndThenThereWereNone">And Then There Were None</a></em>.

One by one, each of the six are targeted by a pair of brothers running the town's museum...and four of them are killed in the most violent of manners. (The two survivors later discover that most of the town's inhabitants have been killed by the brothers through the years, and have to escape the town before they're next.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Identity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Identity">Identity</a></em> is a variation of this. 10 strangers meet in a remote hotel, where they start getting killed one by one by a killer, who is presumably one of them. At first the trope seems to be played straight, as the helpful authority figure cop is revealed to really be a criminal and a killer. However, at the end, it's revealed that <em>the</em> killer who was actually killing the guests was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the little boy. This makes sense because the characters are all personalities inside the mind of a serial killer with multiple personality disorder; the little boy is the murderous personality, representing the abuse the killer experienced as a child</span>.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EdgarWallaceFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EdgarWallaceFilms">Das indische Tuch</a></em> (1963), released in English as "The Frightened Lady".

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mindhunters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mindhunters">Mindhunters</a></em> was another film with this premise, about several FBI students being trained as criminal profilers at a remote training facility.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Triangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Triangle">Triangle</a></em> appears to be one of these, but its "six victims on a haunted cruise ship" beginning gets subverted.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenLittleMurderVictims" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenLittleMurderVictims">Ten Little Murder Victims</a> plot is related in first person by one of the characters.

The narrator then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoSurprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoSurprise">reveals that ''she'' was the killer all along</a>.

His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SecretHistories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SecretHistories">Secret Histories</a> novel <em>The Spy Who Haunted Me</em> has a variant that plays out among spies held together in a group by the terms of their mission, rather than by geographic isolation.

The twist is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the killer isn't actually <em>on</em> the island. He set everything up beforehand and is controlling it remotely.</span>
</li><li> Something like this plays out in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KittyNorville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KittyNorville">Kitty's House of Horrors</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's all a subversion.</span> The panicky, incompetent, suspiciously underinformed person <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> isn't the mole, but survives anyway</span>.

However, almost everyone besides those three and the narrator dies. Everyone in the house was an intended victim</span>.
</li><li> The novel <em>The Man Who Tried To Get Away</em> by Stephen Donaldson is one big heavily-lampshaded exercise in the trope. Private eye Brew Axbrewder is running short on cash and needs to lie low after treading on the toes of a local crime boss, so he reluctantly agrees to be a consultant and participant for a murder mystery vacation in a lodge out in the woods. He (predictably) hates every minute of the contrived <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndThenThereWereNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndThenThereWereNone">And Then There Were None</a></em> event, right up until one of the participants gets killed for real. And someone has cut the phone lines. And a blizzard has blocked the only road back to town. Axbrewder and his partner assume that the crime boss has found out where he is and sent someone to take out Axbrewder and kill all the witnesses, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's only half right. The crime boss does have a hitman at the event (the maintenance man, who gets sent out to try and walk back to town, turns out to be working for him), but neither our hero nor the detective knows that two of the guests are actually violent psychopaths who booked into this vacation for kicks, and it's they rather than the hitman who kill most of the other guests</span>.
</li><li> A major plot thread in the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mistborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mistborn">Mistborn</a></em> book-it appears for much of the book that one of the main characters has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAndReplace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAndReplace">replaced</a> by a kandra, a creature that can consume a corpse then animate it and imitate the person in question almost perfectly. Despite assistance from her own kandra, it takes Vin most of the book to figure out who it was. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">That's because it is her <em>own</em> kandra.</span>
</li><li> A variation happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ErastFandorin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ErastFandorin">Murder on the Leviathan</a></em>, which was intended as a tribute to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie">Agatha Christie</a>; what makes it unusual is that this situation came about when a detective looking for a murderer on a luxury liner had his chief suspects assigned rooms in the same salon.

One of the things they try to unearth while descending through Hell to rescue their father.
</li><li> <em>Ripper</em> is Michael Slade's take on this trope, with the added twist that the guests are all mystery writers <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and there are two killers working together, not just one</span>.
<ul><li> Also, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> kills with pre-rigged death traps, even figuring out who it is won't guarantee safety: the traps will still be lethal.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> novel <em>Kobiyashi Maru</em> this was a training scenario for Starfleet cadets. Several dozen cadets were dropped on an abandoned moonbase and told that one of them was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>. Their teachers then sat back and watched what the cadets did. Typical behavior was to band together into small groups and end up fighting against other groups because one of them could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>. Chekhov's solution was to simply kill EVERYONE (at the end of the training, all his victims assumed he was the Mole. He thought he was the winner. The teachers explained he was simply a very skilled assassin (and a bit of an idiot)). Turns out there was no Mole, the scenario was designed to emphasize the dangers of distrust and paranoia. He was then told that his hero, a young captain named Kirk, had come up with a working solution; he invited all groups to join his, but the condition for joining was that everyone would be disarmed. The exception were two guards selected by Kirk; if one of them happened to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>, the other could just shoot the guy.
</li><li> <em>Ten Little Wizards</em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordDarcy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordDarcy">Lord Darcy</a> novel, is an homage to Christie's version. A subversion, in that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the killer's countdown doesn't make it to "none", and the apparent killing spree is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a> by Polish spies</span>.

Some residents of Haven decide to throw Audrey a birthday party since she's never had one. They decide to throw it on this nice old hotel out in the ocean on a small island with no cellphone reception. Well, long story short, the owner of the hotel had subtly dropped the suggestion that they should throw the party there. Turns out, the owner of the mansion is a chameleon-thing that kills people then turns into them, and he needs more people to change into. So one of the characters are no longer that character. Doesn't help that most of the people there are minor or new characters. Oh, and the ferry isn't coming back to get them until the end of the weekend, but there is a small boat that they ride away on.

After Porky, Petunia, and his siblings leave, Goodwill reveals to the audience his true self as a money-hungry fiend who intends to kill all six pigs and inherit the money; he drinks Hyde formula and transforms himself into a monster.

Before that happens, a chair suddenly is thrown out of nowhere and knocks Goodwill silly, allowing the pig sextet to get the upper hand and subdue the monster in the stocks where Goodwill had restrained them earlier.
