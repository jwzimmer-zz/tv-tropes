Often, what is appropriate to one culture at a given time can be repugnant to the same culture at another, or vice versa. Thus, when depicting other cultures, a creator has to choose whether to portray them accurately or not. Many just use their own contemporary culture for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureBlind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureBlind">everyone in the story</a> for narrative reasons or just to make writing it easier, resulting in an inaccurate and/or anachronistic story. Some, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">research the culture</a> and make an effort to reproduce the attitudes of the time and place accurately, even when they are wildly different to what the author knows or might consider sensible. Thus one ends up with a case of Deliberate Values Dissonance.
</p><p>In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalFiction">Historical Fiction</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalFantasy">Historical Fantasy</a>, this is an obvious necessity to avoid anachronisms; indeed readers may criticize works for failure to reflect the actual historically accurate views as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">Anachronism Stew</a>. This may result in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">Author Tract</a>, the story condemning or praising certain values or societal norms that are no longer relevant. Be wary, though, for sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">Reality Is Unrealistic</a> and the deliberately different values end up just as inaccurate, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThemeParkVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThemeParkVersion">in the opposite direction</a>—a story could present some value as being a relic of the past even if it's still widespread at the time of its writing, or present a value as common in a specific place or time period even if it wasn't (in fact, the page quote is an example of this; murdering one's unfaithful wife with a fireplace poker was hardly universally accepted as appropriate behavior even in the Renaissance).
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>For <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeculativeFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeculativeFiction">Speculative Fiction</a> this is also often a necessity, as it would make no sense for radically different societies—even if they are presented as a future version of the "present" society—to adopt exactly the same values. This can result in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">Author Tract</a> of a different kind, presenting values the author believes could or <em>should</em> arise in certain situations. Conversely, this could simply be a tool for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding">World Building</a>, especially in stories involving extraterrestrials or otherwise completely "alien" civilizations.

</p><p>Another way to sidestep this problem is to write <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMoralSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMoralSubstitute">a family-friendly story</a> set in a small community with a near-homogeneous population, where controversial social or political issues never come up and in fact, can scarcely be imagined.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AnatoliaStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AnatoliaStory">Anatolia Story</a></em>:
<ul><li> Yuri is shocked to learn that a young servant is to be hanged for attacking her (she knew he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a>), just because under their law, she was a prince's concubine and thus a member of the royal family. She finds out that the penalty for attacking a commoner would have gotten him hard labor, and is disgusted to learn that the servant will die for class issues. Later, she is also very surprised to learn that the child (14 years old) prince Juda has a legal wife and several concubines, and that the people of one town she stops in have no concept of basic sanitation and care for injured people.
</li><li> When Yuri and her friends briefly stay in Egypt, they're rather shocked and embarrassed by how Ramses's sister constantly goes around topless, apparently due to the heat, and encourages Yuri to do the same. (This is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense">Artistic License</a>: people in very hot climates tend to actually wear clothing that covers their entire body to avoid exposure to the sun, with the clothing being loose to allow ventilation. Although the breast-baring style was popular at times in Ancient Egypt, it is debatable to what extent.)
</li><li> During her stay in Egypt, Yuri learns that a little child that stole food from a temple will get his hand chopped off, and people who cannot pay their taxes will be thrown into jail or similar, and is obviously appalled. Same with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin">Aladdin</a></em> example, this was (and still is) a very common thing done to thieves.
</li><li> When visiting a city-state that's about to be invaded, Yuri is shocked to find the place filled with prostitutes. She tries to order them all out, on the grounds that the soldiers should be focusing on the upcoming battle, but is persuaded that it's better to let a few stay, because the men use them for stress relief. The implication is that it's normal for prostitutes to be hanging around like that.
</li><li> When Ramses is abducting Yuri, he tells her off for struggling against him when he's being so "nice", which he defines as "not raping her". Yuri is shocked by the audacity of this, because naturally she sees kidnapping as automatically not nice behavior and not raping someone isn't worthy of praise.
</li><li> Yuri is noted to be a very cute girl by modern standards, but in the ancient times, she's often called scrawny and boyish, even somewhat ugly. This is because beautiful women in ancient times were expected to be curvaceous and voluptuous, which Yuri is definitely not. While a number of men do end up falling for her, the story makes it very clear that they're attracted to her personality and willpower, rather than her looks.
</li></ul></li><li> This is played with a lot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>. A constant source of jokes is to have two Nations discuss aspects of their culture (clothing, food, mythology, etc) and watch their shocked reactions to each other. One particular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> is Japan and America visiting each other's houses. Japan is overwhelmed by how huge his order of French Fries are, while America has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> over how small the same order is, in Japan. Japan is shocked by the bizarrely-colored cakes America bakes (even wanting to take its picture) and America has no idea why a beautiful woman in Japan's house just gave him a packet of tissues for free (it was a way to advertise a sex club). At one point, Japan thinks America is a wimp for crying in fear over a movie about ghosts, while Japan himself just makes jokes about it. Japan tries to make America braver by giving him a terrifying Japanese video game to try. Instead of being scared by it, America thinks it's hilarious and replicates one of the ghosts, much to Japan's terror. That particular story ends with Japan thinking, "I have no idea what scares this guy!" (The last story, incidentally, was taking from an actual example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> the artist experienced. He'd watch Americans freak out over ghost movies that the Chinese guys in the room laughed at, while the Americans laughed and made jokes about Japanese horror films that the Japanese people found terrifying).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Lightnovel/BeingAbleToEditSkillsInAnotherWorldIGainedOpWaifus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Lightnovel/BeingAbleToEditSkillsInAnotherWorldIGainedOpWaifus">Being Able to Edit Skills in Another World, I Gained OP Waifus</a></em> has Nagi try to free a slave, Cecil Pharot, that he purchased solely for her knowledge of the New World he was dragged into, after carefully questioning her. On modern Earth, such an act would be considered a mercy. In this New World, she was insulted, and dismayed, thinking he was treating her like trash, trying to throw her away. It took a lot of apologizing and head patting for him to convince her she was wrong.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em> has some fun with this.

When Yuuri and Edward begin going against these norms they bring shame on themselves even if what they're saying sounds reasonable from a modern perspective if you don't pay too much attention to the context. However, in context, it's pretty clear that Edward is only saying this out of self-interest rather than any genuinely altruistic motivations and his hypocrisy becomes obvious as soon as he runs out of good arguments and falls back on being the prince.
</li><li> The protagonist Iris is considered a huge radical for using her own money to fund mandatory primary education, an agricultural college and a university to increase social mobility to simulate the economy and end economically disruptive farming practices.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Marvel</a> version presents Cap with some rather modernly distasteful attitudes, as part of a more "realistic" take on what a soldier and average American citizen from 1940 would really be like, especially if he time-skipped to the 2000s. Most prominently, he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleBigot">Noble Bigot</a>, a firm believer in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong">My Country, Right or Wrong</a> (as seen during his confrontation with Ultimate Nuke), and he holds an infamous disdain for the French, whom he views as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheeseEatingSurrenderMonkeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheeseEatingSurrenderMonkeys">Cheese-Eating Surrender Monkeys</a>. The last is probably meant to reflect a US soldier's loathing of the French as a whole for capitulating to the Nazis early in the War and forcing many US soldiers to die trying to free the French from their own government, though it's rather ahistorical. America was still rather Francophilic at the time — General Patton adored the country — and anti-French sentiment only really picked up during the 1950s under deGaulle's rather abrasive leadership of the nation. This contrasts with 616-Cap, who worked with the Resistance and hates portrayals of the French as cowards: "The government surrendered. The people never did."
<ul><li> An inadvertently inverted version cropped up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUltimates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUltimates">The Ultimates</a> 3</em>.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarrenEllis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarrenEllis">Warren Ellis</a> gives a similar portrayal in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nextwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nextwave">Nextwave</a></em>. In a flashback, Cap is shown telling Captain Marvel (his black, female teammate) to leave a battle and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">make him something to eat</a>. Then again, this is <em>Nextwave,</em> so it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>.
</li><li> The idea is subverted in an issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungAvengers">Young Avengers</a></em>. Wiccan is shocked when Captain America expresses approval for his gay relationship with Hulkling, figuring that someone born in the 1920s would not view homosexuals in a positive light. (Oddly enough, the most common backstory for Steve Rogers has him grow up in a prominent gay neighborhood.)
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdBrubaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdBrubaker">Ed Brubaker</a>'s <em>Captain America</em> run, there was a one-shot where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuckyBarnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuckyBarnes">the Winter Soldier</a> teamed up with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungAvengers">Young Avengers</a>. Though he got along well with the black teen hero Patriot (he was friends with the black Human Top and the Japanese-American Golden Girl during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">WWII</a>), Kate Bishop called him out on his language after he referred to a group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mooks</a> as "pansies." He shrugged it off by saying that he was from the 40s, and thus had no idea the term was considered a slur on homosexuals in a modern context. Which is itself ahistorical as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanYouThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanYouThink">pansy has been used as a slang term for gay men since the 1920s</a>.
</li><li> In the 70s, Cap and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheFalcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheFalcon">The Falcon</a> fought William Burnside and Jack Monroe, the Captain America and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuckyBarnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuckyBarnes">Bucky</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">of the 1950s</a>. Both were decidedly racist and sexist, with Jack in particular hurling racist insults at the Falcon and insinuating that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Agent13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Agent13">Sharon Carter</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreDelicate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreDelicate">was a weakling because she's a woman</a>. Burnside ultimately graduated to a full-fledged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilReactionary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilReactionary">Evil Reactionary</a> supervillain, a willing ally of the neo-fascistic far-right "Watchdogs" and even of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedSkull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedSkull">Red Skull</a> in their fight to forcibly restore American culture to a 1950s hardline conservative's version of "the good old days".
</li></ul></li><li> At least one comic book version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/XenaWarriorPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/XenaWarriorPrincess">Xena: Warrior Princess</a></em> walked back some of the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">Anachronism Stew</a> by showing a slight difference of attitudes toward slavery between Xena and Gabrielle. When presented with a Roman band of slaves about to be auctioned off, Gabrielle is appalled at slavery in general (not a common attitude in classical Rome) and in particular, that one of the slaves is a pregnant woman. Xena, in contrast, is generally convinced that the (otherwise all-male) slaves must be criminals who've done something to deserve their situation, but makes an exception in the pregnant woman's case as it seems improbable to her that a pregnant woman could be guilty of any serious crime. Xena and Gabrielle thus agree to go buy the woman free, each for their own reasons — but leave the rest of them to be sold. Conversely, while touting the various qualities of the slaves, the auctioneer not only flogs how strong one particular big black guy is, but adds "...and smart! Nubians are smart! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">You'll never have to tell him anything twice.</a>" (If a slave auctioneer in America's antebellum Old South had advertised a slave's intelligence, he would have had a hard time making the sale; a smart "uppity" slave was considered a likely flight risk. Roman masters, in contrast, regularly encouraged their slaves to learn a trade and buy themselves free so they could buy younger slaves to replace them and wouldn't have to pay for older slaves' upkeep when they were too old to work.)

Klara is more upset at the possibility of them recruiting her for a union than the fact that she was forced by her parents to marry a man who is old enough to be her father, and who beats her and is implied to rape her.

Five thousand years ago, he was a great hero who rose up from slavery, freed his people from the cruelty of an evil tyrant, and ruled over them for many years as a just, wise, and beloved king who bravely fought to protect them and brought them safety, peace, and plenty. But in the modern age of democracy and superheroes who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">respect the sanctity of life</a>, his once Grade-A heroic methods look rather barbaric.

All the main male characters throw racial, sexual and Antisemitic slurs around with careless abandon — even the ones who aren't unrepentant Nazi sympathizers — and treat women mostly as animated sex dolls who exist solely for their sexual gratification. The women also take any opportunity to get their clothes off and have sex, but that can probably be chalked up to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService">different trope</a>.

For instance, Sanshobo told the story to Usagi of how he failed to save the son of his master from falling to his death. Sanshobo told his own son there was only one to make up for that failure; his son stated he understood what was involved, and deliberately leaped to his own death. While the average Western reader would be horrified to see a tragedy compounded by another, neither Sanshobo nor Usagi dispute that was the right thing to do in their eyes.

This belief goes to the extent that raids like those performed by Vikings are considered justified if they're being done for survival purposes; for example, in issue 12 we see a Decepticon battalion who kidnap natives on a planet to use for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToServeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToServeMan">Pink Alchemy</a> and don't consider it wrong because they're starving and desperate.

</li><li> Cross culture problems occur in-universe; Autobots strongly believe in a mix of democracy and egalitarianism, while Decepticons believe in a sort of fusion of communism and meritocracy. At one point Krok finishes off an already wounded enemy and none of the Scavengers react much, while First Aid has a guilt-induced breakdown after killing the defenseless <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pharma</span>. Autobots allow members to follow whatever beliefs they want, while Decepticons are almost all atheists and tend to talk down to those who do practice religion.
<ul><li> The Transformers from the colony world Caminus worship the Primes — including Optimus Prime — as deities. This causes some problems when a group of them tries to proselytize about Optimus in a Decepticon ghetto.

</li><li> In the very first issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PaperGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PaperGirls">Paper Girls</a></em>, one of the protagonists insults a group of bullies by calling them "faggots" and insinuating that they have AIDS. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianKVaughan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianKVaughan">Brian K. Vaughan</a> has said he was aware the scene would upset gay and lesbian readers, but that he felt it was important to establish just how rampant casual taunts about sexuality were in the 1980s. Mac, the girl in question, also smokes heavily without any regard for what it'll mean for her health, despite being a kid. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When the girls later travel to 2016, they find out that Mac ends up dying from leukemia, likely brought on by her fondness for cigarettes.</span>

Amusingly enough, the one dark-skinned member of the tribe proves to be just as enlightened as the heroes.

He hasn't evolved much, however, which makes him a pretty dark character by modern standards and occasional outright villain for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateXMen">Ultimate X-Men</a></em>: Xavier's plan is going well, as he has negotiated an halt to the Sentinel initiative and a human-mutant summit. He is pleased with it. Cyclops, however, wants equal rights, now. Xavier points that this usually a juvenile attitude, and as an adult he knows patience, seeing the bigger picture and taking slow but secure steps instead of rushed ones.
</li><li> Very common in the chilean comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Mampato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Mampato">Mampato</a></em>, where in his multiple trips in time and space our heroes have encountered things like slavery, racism, sexism, disproportionate punishments (Twenty lashes for stealing an apple!) , <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice">Human Sacrifice</a>, etc, etc, in addition to a fairly anti-ecological treatment of wildlife, such as when chilean farmers use traps to kill condors, because they steal the young of the cattle, something that real life condors, which feed on dead animals, never do.

It also doesn't sugarcoat the rather complicated relations between first- and second-generation Ashkenazi immigrants who tended to live in slums and affluent, assimilated Sephardi communities.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LeagueOfExtraordinaryGentlemen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LeagueOfExtraordinaryGentlemen">League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a></em> positively adores this trope in any era it covers.

For most of the story, it's used by American heroes fighting for democracy, or failed to be used by those whose ideals have been contaminated by elitism. In the flashback to its origin in Arthurian England, both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackKnight">Black Knight</a> and the narration have no question that its creators are villains, with a mad scheme to overturn the divine rights of the nobility, and that any society in which their beliefs succeeded would be terrible.

<ul><li> It is noted that while the Captain Britain of the 1970s, Brian Falsworth, was out to his close childhood friend Alison Carter (and possibly to his friends and family), he wasn't out publicly. Instead, he had to maintain a superficially solely professional relationship with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCouple">professional and romantic partner</a> Roger Aubrey, while Alison acted as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeard">The Beard</a> for him on several occasions, while Roger apparently "made his own arrangements".
</li><li> While Asgard initially comes off as a progressive utopia which works well with most of modern Earth, it is made quite clear that it's far from perfect: there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">an unconscious expectation of military prowess, especially in noble bloodlines</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonScientistsGetNoRespect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonScientistsGetNoRespect">with the implication that those lacking it get a related degree of lesser respect</a>), and while they're fond of humanity and like their plucky style, the average Asgardian view is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyEarthlings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyEarthlings">benevolent condescension</a> (though the Avengers are changing that). Additionally, they only ever accepted one mortal race (Kryptonians) as their equals, and there's prevalent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">discrimination against Frost Giants</a>. Oh, and due to the whole 'living for over 5000 years' thing, it can be a little difficult for them to get the significance of a decade here and there - which Harry, who's 13 at the start of the story, and has abandonment issues, is not pleased about.
<ul><li> And it turns out that Odin is a pretty progressive ruler. While his grandfather, Buri, is indicated to have been the same, Odin's father, Bor Burison, was a very different matter, with the story illustrating how unpleasant things were. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeDivineOnMortal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeDivineOnMortal">Use and abuse of humans</a> was either ignored or encouraged, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">Stay in the Kitchen</a> values were in favour, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriages</a> were the norm, and Asgard's grip on the Nine Realms was much more iron-fisted, brutal and militaristic. The key point, though, is that while he is seen as "a throwback" and the main reaction is "good riddance", he was well enough supported in his lifetime and going by in-story accounts, despite several millennia of hard work Odin is <em>still</em> undoing his misrule. It is also heavily implied that Bor is far from the only ruler of that kind Asgard has had, with the assessment of potential Kings and Queens by the Norns focusing less "will this person be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing">The Good King</a>?", more "will this person go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy">Axe-Crazy</a> and threaten the integrity of Yggdrasil?", with Thor citing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReformedButNotTamed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReformedButNotTamed">Loki</a>, Bor, and himself pre <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> as examples of the sort of people it does <em>not</em> filter out.

Most South African readers are accepting of this and get that this is used to highlight the absurdity of a crazy social system that <em>must</em> have a Discworld correspondence, especially when seen through the eyes of an emigrant trying to shake off her cultural conditioning and restructure her thought patterns when she arrives in Ankh-Morpork (and how do you apply apartheid in a multi-species world where skin color can be... well, it ceases to be just a black-and-white thing). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">There have been some interesting discussions in private correspondence</a>, though, with Saffies who are indignant about their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">portrayal</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAfrikaner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAfrikaner">bluff, thick, insensitive and loud</a>. An "Israeli" character has been introduced in another tale.

A single reference to recent contentious events in Gaza - in a <em>footnote</em> - drew flak from Israeli and pro-Israeli readers of Pessimal's work.
</li><li> A number of people in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/EnoughRope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/EnoughRope">Enough Rope</a></em> ponder this idea in regards to Steve Rogers. The man might have been fairly progressive back during World War II, but over seventy years later, those same ideas of his range from outdated to condescending to outright racist.

<ul><li> Silver Millennium Survivors largely see nothing wrong with homosexuality, as they have various means and methods that allows a homosexual couple to have children.
</li><li> Aincrad's society is an <em>armed</em> society, meaning that nearly all of its adult, and many of its young adults, residents have immediate access to a weapon of some sort. A lot of its civilians are also militia trained. This stems from the fact that, while it always had a sizeable civilian population, it is has a <em>lot</em> of dangerous wildlife outside of the fortified towns that are within it.
</li><li> While it is not made a major plot point, it is noted that Minako has <em>Western Values</em> when it comes to things like what the appropriate age of her partner should be. Since she is an adult, her partner has to be at <em>least</em> eighteen. Thus, any relationship with Lux, who is sixteen, will remain platonic until she is of age and they can start courting.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Mulan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Mulan">Mulan</a></em> is just full of sexist songs like <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiqmZLOaD8o">"A Girl Worth Fighting For"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZzWCXgDmkY">"Honour to Us All"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which fit in with how casually patriarchal ancient China was. They also include some odd ancient Chinese fetishes, like when one of the men mentions he wants a girl "paler than the moon." Also, when they're not going on about what women should be like, they're going on about how important it is to "Be a man!" in the "I'll Make a Man Out of You" song.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePrinceOfEgypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePrinceOfEgypt">The Prince of Egypt</a></em>:
<ul><li> Played up with the moral ambiguity of the plagues. In Biblical times, God killing the firstborn sons of your enemies was clearly a good thing. With a more modern eye and attention to characterization, it becomes a gut-wrenching event for both Moses and Ramses.
</li><li> The film makes Moses' adopted father Seti go from being a stern but loving dad to being pretty creepy just by reminding us how he (and most of the Egyptians) saw the Israelites: "Oh my son, they were only slaves." This follows into Ramses' opinion on the Israelites, who views them the same way as every other member of his family.
</li><li> Several facts from the religious texts the story originated from were changed/omitted for the movie to make the protagonists more sympathetic to a modern audience (e.g. in the movie, Moses killing a slave master is accidental, according to the religious texts Moses did it deliberately).
</li></ul></li><li> In the prequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JosephKingOfDreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JosephKingOfDreams">Joseph: King of Dreams</a></em>, Joseph knowing how to read and write is clearly shown as being an unusual but incredibly helpful skill he has. The movie also shows in pretty disturbing detail Joseph's being sold into slavery, with him at one point seeing how scarred the back of another slave is from being whipped.
</li><li> Hinted at in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePrincessAndTheFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePrincessAndTheFrog">The Princess and the Frog</a></em>. While a lot of Tiana's hardships come from her being poor, there are a good many implications that she also has to fight against prejudice for being black and female. One of the most noticeable is when the owners of a mill Tiana wants to buy casually dismiss her getting upset over being outbid, telling her "A woman of your... background, you're better off staying where you're at." While the exact meaning of the sentence is ambiguous enough that it could be interpreted a few ways, her reaction would tell anyone who knows about black rights at that time period what they were implying.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin">Aladdin</a></em>, Princess Jasmine sneaks out and inadvertently gives away a fruit to a beggar child without buying it first. Lacking money, the vendor would have chopped off her hand for stealing if Aladdin hadn't intervened and rescued her. This was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> for many societies of that era (and still is practiced in some modern countries).
<ul><li> The trope is averted, however, in that the Sultan granting his daughter the right to decide who she marries as long as he's of socially appropriate rank (later changed to anyone she chooses, with no other conditions), rather than arranging the best politically beneficial marriage for his daughter, would be considered shockingly radical.
</li></ul></li><li> In addition to the bullfighting example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBookOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBookOfLife">The Book of Life</a></em>, there's also the subtle disdain that some have about Maria's interest in books and her "unwomanly" attitudes.
</li><li> Many of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyPrincess">Disney Princess</a></em> characters are teenagers (with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs">Snow White</a> being the youngest at fourteen). During the times the stories were set, it was more acceptable to marry young. Most post-2000s princesses are at least eighteen if they are married.
</li><li> Averted by most of the good adult characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBreadwinner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBreadwinner">The Breadwinner</a></em>. Razaq seems to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo">just doing what he has to</a> in his mind to maintain order more than anything else and Nurallah intends to educate his daughters as fully as he can and wants Parvana to have a carefree childhood without worrying about being married off. Played straight with Fattema <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">arranging a marriage</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins">between her own daughter, Soraya, and her cousin's son</a>. Arranged marriages are pretty unheard of in modern Western cultures, between relatives especially.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pocahontas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pocahontas">Pocahontas</a></em>
<ul><li> The first movie has sympathetic characters blatantly say they're travelling to America to take all the resources, and they'll kill any Native Americans that try to stop them. They freely call the Natives "savages", which Pocahontas is understandably furious about when she first hears John say it.
</li><li> The second has Ratcliffe exploiting this, inviting Pocahontas to a ball at the court where a bear-baiting is to happen. Considered appropriate public entertainment to the English, Pocahontas is horrified and calls everyone "barbarians" - getting locked in the Tower of London for it.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LovingVincent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LovingVincent">Loving Vincent</a></em>, one woman in Auvers expresses disgust for the fact that Vincent van Gogh killed himself on a Sunday. Until recently, suicide was considered an act of cowardice <em>and</em> a mortal sin, so him doing it on the Lord's Day made it even worse in her eyes.
</li><li> An in-universe example played for comedy can be seen in the marriage of Jessica and Roger Rabbit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhoFramedRogerRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhoFramedRogerRabbit">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a></em>. The two are an extremely mismatched pair; Jessica is an animated pin-up girl with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleHourglassFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleHourglassFigure">Impossible Hourglass Figure</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser">a great deal of street smarts</a>, whilst Roger is a hyperactive, bumbling, toony rabbit — sort of if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny">Bugs Bunny</a> was designed more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse">Mickey Mouse</a>, then given a double-helping of comedic bad luck. Both humans and toons comment on the strangeness of the pairing, and that one partner clearly married up. Humans think that it's Roger... but toons think it's <em>Jessica</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a> kicks in as to why the reactions are so different, and it boils down to another layer of this trope; toon culture revolves around comedy and being funny, and Jessica Rabbit? She's a living <em>human</em> sex symbol that works as a lounge singer — she pushes human buttons fine, thanks to her figure and her voice, but she literally does nothing for the standard toon, because there's nothing inherently funny about her. Roger, on the other hand, is a successful Hollywood comedian that can get most people laughing, so he's extremely attractive by toon standards.

Clara's denied entry just over two centuries ago, which in and of itself was hardly a time for enlightened views on women in general. But then you realize the Brethen are strongly implied to be much, much older than that and time clearly hasn't shaken the trappings of countless centuries of sexism by the time Clara wants to join. The fact her low birth is also a strike against her falls squarely into this trope too.

</li><li> The scenes with Amy's family, portraying a very conservative Muslim family and the women preaching their roles as a woman, including modesty and subservience to men making Amy's eventual rebellion all the more shocking to them.

On one occasion, he meets the film's leading lady, who happens to be the first white woman he's ever seen. He thinks she's the ugliest woman he's ever seen.

The segregationists mostly act out of fear, paranoia, and vanity rather than any profound hatred, while another scene shows a white woman throwing fireworks into a crowd of peaceful protesters and starting a race riot just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>. Even Edna Turnblad is nervous about her daughter hanging out with "color people". And it <em>still</em> manages to be very upbeat.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Help" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Help">Help!</a></em>: It may seem disconcerting to see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> (especially Lennon, although it's very obvious from his facial expression and tone of voice that he is mocking such attitudes) referring to "filthy Eastern ways" regarding their cultist pursuers, but all the deliberately stilted dialog in the movie is meant to invoke old movie and adventure novel cliches.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHourOfThePig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHourOfThePig">The Hour of the Pig</a></em>: The film is highly realistic in showing the life of Renaissance-era Europeans. While it is extremely bizarre to us, they not only take seriously the idea that animals can commit crimes, but actually try them for this with full court proceedings, including appointed <em>defense lawyers</em>. Discrimination toward Jews and Moors is not only rampant but enshrined in the law, with a Jewish man noting his testimony isn't even admissible as evidence. In contrast to modern people who might have thought Christians in those days more prudish, they are quite casual about being nude at a bathhouse even with many members of the opposite sex around. They'll even just have sex with someone else right next door (and prostitution is fairly open, along with being entirely legal). Religion holds pride of place in social life, with all work stopping when Advent time begins, while both mores and laws stem from Christian beliefs (either for better or worse). Also, in contrast to popular conceptions, the village priest expresses skepticism of witchcraft (though inaccurate in portraying this as heretical). When it's set, witchcraft had only begun to even be accepted as real by the Church (sadly).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ICantThinkStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ICantThinkStraight">I Can't Think Straight</a></em>: A significant plot point, as Tala's family is highly traditional.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IpMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IpMan">Ip Man</a></em> doesn't shy from depicting Japanese brutality towards Chinese or Western racism.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Lincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Lincoln">Lincoln</a></em>:
<ul><li> Many of the characters display the usual racial prejudices of the time, and Thaddeus Stevens' belief in racial equality is frighteningly radical to his peers. It's especially hammered when Representative George Yeaman says he cannot endorse the 13th Amendment <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlipperySlopeFallacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlipperySlopeFallacy">because it might lead to further reform</a>. Even the Republicans balk alongside their Democratic counterparts as Yeaman floats the idea of woman's suffrage.
<div class="indent"><strong>Yeaman:</strong> What shall follow upon that? Universal enfranchisement? Votes for <em>women</em>?
</div></li><li> Also, the shameless use of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoils_system">Spoils System<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in order to secure the necessary votes. Short of actual bribery, the promising of patronage positions was legal, if not necessarily well-regarded, which is why Lincoln did not want to be identified with it. These tactics are now illegal and would be seen as blatant corruption in the modern day. Arguably, it was the assassination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesGarfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesGarfield">another President</a> by a disgruntled office-seeker that was largely responsible for the change, a change implemented in large part (appropriately enough) by George Pendleton, perhaps the closest thing <em>Lincoln</em> has to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>.
</li><li> An anecdote is mentioned of a woman due to be convicted for murder even though the jury was reluctant to convict her, knowing she acted in self-defense. Since the law didn't make that allowance for women then, she's allowed to flee while everyone's back is turned and no one bothers to search for her.
</li><li> Thaddeus Stevens has to hide his belief in racial equality so this fear doesn't kill the Amendment, plus the fact he's married in all but name to his black maid.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLoneRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLoneRanger">The Lone Ranger</a></em> the treatment of American Indian peoples, including calling them savages, reflects the time period.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveAndHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveAndHonor">Love and Honor</a></em> is ripe with this, but the kicker is when the (truly lovable) hero throws his (also very sweet) wife out the house for being raped. She comments in all earnestness: "At least he was kind enough not to cut off my head." Though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">later they reconcile, he never apologizes for it.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MasterAndCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MasterAndCommander">Master and Commander</a></em>:
<ul><li> The ship's first officer asking permission to bring live Galapagos tortoises on board as food stock. Of course, lots of people still eat tortoises and turtles, but no one in modern times thinks of Galapagos tortoises as food courses.
</li><li> Also, prepubescent boys acting as officers, commanding men at least thrice their age by the simple benefit of coming from the upper class.
</li><li> At the end of the film, captain Aubrey comments that they need to get going before "God forbid, peace breaks out." To a modern eye, this seems so callous most people would blow it off a sarcastic joke. To someone like Jack Aubrey, a junior commander without significant political connections in the early 19th century, peace would mean being stuck on shore with half-pay and no prospects of either a ship command or promotion, and poverty being a very real threat if he didn't manage to stash away enough money from taking prizes before then.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mid90s" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mid90s">mid90s</a></em> focuses on the much more realistic 90's rather than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">idealized version</a> that is frequently portrayed in popular culture, and as a result, this happens quite a bit.
<ul><li> Stevie having an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherBully">abusive older brother</a>, and it really not being dealt with by the mother was very much how sibling abuse was like back in the 90's.
</li><li> All of the main teenagers use homophobic, misogynistic, and racist language. While the racist language is used under the excuse of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NWordPrivileges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NWordPrivileges">N-Word Privileges</a>, the homophobia and misygonistic comments are portrayed as acceptable, instead of awful, which is what it was during the decade.
</li><li> Stevie has a sexual encounter at a party with a girl much older than him. Stevie is 13, but everyone treats it as a great accomplishment. One night stands between people who had age differences between them, even if that person could not legally consent, were very common at parties in the 90's.
</li><li> One of the teens faces absolutely no punishment, aside from what is implied to be a guilty conscience for driving drunk and high and nearly getting Stevie killed. This is very much how drunk driving was treated during the decade, as a minor crime, even if people died in a crash.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MississippiBurning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MississippiBurning">Mississippi Burning</a></em> illustrates the Ku Klux Klan-dominated atmosphere of the namesake state in 1964, with the antagonists frequently making use of racial slurs and cross-burnings.
</li><li> Seen a lot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MonsieurVincent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MonsieurVincent">Monsieur Vincent</a></em>, in which a cleric in 17th century France becomes a crusader dedicated to helping the poor, which involves getting the pampered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleRich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleRich">Idle Rich</a> nobility to overcome their class prejudices and fork over money. Most prominent in the scene where the Ladies of Charity tell Vincent that he is asking for too much and they can't do any more. Vincent, who has had enough of their carping and criticism, puts the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorstopBaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorstopBaby">Doorstop Baby</a> he just rescued on the table, and demands to know what they'll do about it. It turns out that the rich ladies will do nothing, as they are sickened and disgusted by the baby, regarding it as a product of sin, suggesting that the baby should die for that reason. Even the nuns have the same attitude, refusing to look Vincent in the face. An angry Vincent snarls that when God wanted someone to die for human sin, he sent his Son.
</li><li> Zig-zagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a></em>. Hygiene is ignored and witchcraft is believed to exist but some characters criticize autocratic monarchy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ophelia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ophelia">Ophelia</a></em> has several examples, due to being set in medieval Denmark.
<ul><li> Polonius thinks he's being a bad father because he allowed Ophelia to do as she pleased provided it wasn't harming her, such as learning to read, and he failed to arrange a marriage for her. He says he didn't know how to raise a girl, so he raised his daughter more or less the same as his son and took her opinions into account.
</li><li> Ophelia doesn't receive a formal education alongside her brother and isn't allowed into the library because she's a girl (and lowborn at that). When Horatio invites her into the library, she points out she's not allowed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousSpirit">before going in anyway</a>. Gertrude also expresses surprise she can read at all and the other ladies don't seem to believe she can, even sniggering about it.
</li><li> Mechtild was accused of witchcraft because her child - conceived out of wedlock - was stillborn and she's an expert on plants and poisons.
</li><li> Ophelia wanting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryForLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryForLove">Marry for Love</a> and the fact her father did is considered a novelty.
</li><li> Ophelia and other characters react as if she's gone skinny dipping when she's encountered swimming in an ankle-length shift.
</li><li> Ophelia and Hamlet can't be together openly <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">or marry</span> as she's a commoner.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanTheCurseOfTheBlackPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanTheCurseOfTheBlackPearl">Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl</a></em>, Anamaria's gender makes Gibbs wary of bringing her on the ship because of the belief that women bring bad luck, but eventually relents. It's historically accurate that sailors were wary of having women on board, and there <em>were</em> a few notable female pirates during the Golden Age of Piracy, including <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Bonny">Anne Bonny<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Read">Mary Read<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The fact that no one even considers it worth mentioning that she's black is also accurate, since pirates loved stealing slave vessels (they had a lot of room), and would happily take on competent sailors regardless of skin colour.
</li><li> A throwaway line in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrinceOfPersiaTheSandsOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrinceOfPersiaTheSandsOfTime">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a></em> mentions the Crown Prince having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Polyamory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Polyamory">several</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalancedHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalancedHarem">wives</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSandlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSandlot">The Sandlot</a></em> features a scene where Ham and the leader of their rival team begin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VolleyingInsults" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VolleyingInsults">Volleying Insults</a> that ends with Ham saying "You play ball like a <em><strong>GIRL!</strong></em>". Everyone treats this as the worst thing you can say to a guy. Of course, this is because the film takes place in 1962 before feminism and Title IX took off and most girls began participating in sports.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sappho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sappho">Sappho</a></em>: Phil is more tolerant than most 1920s people would be of his wife cross-dressing and having sex with a woman. He still clearly isn't happy though (not just of her cheating, but acting too "masculine" in his view). Other people also disapprove when Sappho is publicly dressed as a man, though only mildly. Phil also very much dislikes her having a tattoo, saying only sailors and whores get them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShapeOfWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShapeOfWater">The Shape of Water</a></em> has a character who is a closeted gay man, frequently visiting a pie shop because he has a crush on the owner. He tries making a pass at him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Cue him being ordered out of the shop because it's "a family place", while two black people are also denied service just because</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShopOnMainStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShopOnMainStreet">The Shop on Main Street</a></em> is a Slovak film set in 1942, dealing with the deportation of the Jews from Slovakia (to their deaths in Nazi concentration camps). Except for one person who is connected to the Slovak resistance, none of the Christians in the town have any problem with the Jews being stripped of their property and sent away. The protagonist's wife is overjoyed when she finds out that he will be receiving a confiscated Jewish shop.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpaceCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpaceCop">Space Cop</a></em>: Ted Cooper is from the 1940s and unfrozen in the present day, so he often blithely expresses anachronistic values, saying things like, "Say, 'Ohn,' that's a chink name, isn't it?" and "I know <em>women</em> who are smarter than you!"
</li><li> On the surface, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarshipTroopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarshipTroopers">Starship Troopers</a></em> is a simple sci-fi action movie about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines">Space Marines</a> fighting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BugWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BugWar">giant alien bugs</a>, however, it's pretty clear from the early scenes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">The Federation</a> is an aggressive, militaristic fascist society. None of the "heroes" think there is anything wrong with the way things are, are all enthusiastic soldiers of the regime and happily consume/star in bombastic state propaganda.
<ul><li> The best example of the film's intentional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDissonance">Moral Dissonance</a> is the last scene after the heroes capture the Brain Bug, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilPatrickHarris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilPatrickHarris">Neil Patrick Harris</a>' character (wearing a hat and greatcoat ensemble <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingOnTheReich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingOnTheReich">not seen on a military officer since 1945</a>) uses his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy">telepathy</a> to read its mind and exclaims "It's afraid!" In another sci-fi film, this would be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a> and a basis for understanding and sympathy between the two species; what happens instead is every trooper present <em>cheers in exaltation</em>, at having such power over a defeated enemy.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Timeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Timeline">Timeline</a></em>, despite its poor reception, has one of the most accurate depictions of medieval values in modern fiction.
<ul><li> It's rather well summed up in the scene where the main party is escaping and the Scotsman standing a few feet from the guard, with an arrow pointed at his chest says something to the effect of "Stay quiet if you value your life." The guard picks up his sword and yells "Traitors!" running at him. Before promptly being shot in the chest.
</li><li> Lord de Vannes's casual murder of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">François</span> after forcing him to say "I am a spy" is seen as nothing more than a mild diversion for the English. After all, they're at war with the French, so anything is allowed, right?
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopsyTurvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopsyTurvy">Topsy-Turvy</a></em>: William Gilbert has to deal with an actor who has a hissy fit over his costume which seems too "revealing," even though by modern audiences' eyes, it is demure.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Us" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Us">Us</a></em> briefly invokes this. The Santa Cruz boardwalk in 1986 has a funhouse with a tacky Native American theme, while in the present the building stays more-or-less exactly the same inside and out, but the native shaman above the door has been replaced with a much less controversial Merlin.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello">Elvis Costello</a>'s <em>Oliver's Army</em> makes mention of "one more widow, one less white nigger", referring to occupying soldiers in Northern Ireland shooting at Catholic nationalists during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles">The Troubles</a>.
</li><li> A controversial example comes in the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DireStraits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DireStraits">Dire Straits</a>'s "Money For Nothing" which had a verse that repeatedly used the word "faggot". This caused a bit of an uproar in 1985 and led the band to be accused of homophobia. And while the radio version replaced it with "queenie" (which while still homophobic, didn't have as harsh connotations) the band itself cleared up that they did not endorse homophobia, they used the word to show just how much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> the narrator of the song was (already having hinted to have rather backwards views such as viewing the music industry as not real jobs hence the song's title). That didn't stop the song from being de facto banned from Canadian radio in 2011 after a single listener complained over the uncensored version being played; however the fact the band <em>did</em> make an alternate version available was one of the factors that led to the song being allowed back on Canadian radio after about nine months (though the original version is still the more common).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RandyNewman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RandyNewman">Randy Newman</a> does this quite often, as his songs are usually first-person narratives, but he often chooses a narrator who has the very opinions that he is criticizing. Of special mention are "Sail Away", sang from the POV of a slaver convincing Africans to board his ship to America, and "Christmas in Cape Town", a song about Apartheid sung by a white racist.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/X">X</a>'s <em>Los Angeles</em> has the unnamed lead character want to leave Los Angeles, and one reason is she hates 'every nigger and Jew, every homosexual and the idle rich'. The context is that she is having a midlife crisis ('her toys wore out and her boys have too'), and is blaming others for her own problems, which has led her to believe she can escape them by moving to a rural area. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> and refers to something known as White Flight. The use of the epithets succeeded in attracting controversy for the song, though makes more sense in the context that a lot of their songs were based on overheard conversations, as opposed to being the group's opinion.

<ul><li> It's especially noticeable in the "Jefferson Reid, Ace American" and "Amelia Earhart, Fearless Flyer" settings.

</li><li> In "Desdemona Hughes, Diva Detective", the title character was a star of the silent movie era whose fame faded with the rise of "talkies" and has the sensibilities of that period. For instance, she has no problem making jokes about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackface" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackface">Blackface</a>. "Desdomona" also plays it differently, as one episode features a man whose being outed as gay actually benefited his career, when something like that happening in the real 1940s would almost certainly have had a <em>much</em> different reaction.
</li><li> One of the "sponsors" of the <em>Thrilling Adventure Hour</em> is Patriot Brand Cigarettes. The live shows feature actual advertisements of them between segments. Some of those segments, such as "Sparks Nevada, Marshal on Mars", are portrayed as radio plays intended for a child audience.

He goes with it, figuring his adult knowledge will make schoolwork a breeze...then he blurts out that President Truman had kicked General MacArthur out of Korea, forgetting it hadn't happened yet. His teacher is horrified, but he continues his train of thought, going into a Vietnam-era rant about the futility of trying to police the world. The story's tagline was "If you knew then what you know now, boy, would <em>you</em> be in trouble..."

For example, Thomas Jefferson in his first appearance relates a funny anecdote about writing the Declaration of Independence, halfway through the line "We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal" his ink ran out, and he sent his slave to get more, seeing no contradiction in this. It's also implied that Jack the Ripper was Queen Victoria's nephew, and she ordered the Prime Minister to let him rampage freely, and shielded him from justice, only concerned with the shame the scandal would bring on the Royal Family, not the deaths of her subjects. It's all completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, of course.

The opening chapter lampshades this, stating that if you find it offensive you are at full liberty to not include it in your game and that "This is not a feature of Bretonnian society of which the author and Games Workshop approves" and furthermore that "The author and Black Library also does not approve of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillThePoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillThePoor">the arbitrary execution of peasants</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyReasonForWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyReasonForWar">fighting local wars over an insult</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil">worshiping the Ruinous Powers</a>, all activities depicted herein.

<ul><li> Some of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> novels imply that homosexuality is regarded as an act of worshipping <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">Slaanesh</a> and thus punishable by burning at the stake.
</li><li> People with mental disorders are treated with revulsion and suspicion. If their condition invokes humour or pity then they are sometimes tolerated, but if not they are quickly driven away.

Slavery, racism, murderous xenophobia, the glorification of ignorance and mindless zeal, religious fundamentalism — and that's just the humans!

The Imperium is also very culturally and religiously diverse, with few if any cultural standards enforced beyond "Don't muck about with aliens (unless you are a Rogue Trader) or Chaos, venerate the Emperor (in some way, no-one really cares how), pay tithes on time and in full, and don't get in the way of Imperial authorities when/if they roll onto your homeworld." Slavery is legal, as long as it's between humans. Humans being owned by aliens is a horrible, unforgivable sin, and the Imperium has mobilized entire army groups to punish alien civilizations for using human labor (or livestock).

Reasoning that some players would be uncomfortable playing accurate Victorian values unironically, the game encourages them to create characters whose beliefs are more in line with their own sensibilities, and hence profoundly revolutionary by 19th-Century standards.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Hackmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Hackmaster">Hackmaster</a></em>, there is a system of Honor points, generally gained for heroic actions and lost for cowardly or heinous ones, which gives in-game benefits to characters who consistently act honorably. However, different character classes and alignments gain and lose honor for different things, so a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> shining knight type would gain honor for charity, defeating great foes in honest combat, and standing to fight even against overwhelming odds, while a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral">Chaotic Neutral</a> thief would gain points for successful robbery and fleeing from the aforementioned overwhelming opponent in order to poison or backstab them at a later date, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> monster would be rewarded for taking slaves or torturing useful information out of someone. And in the module Little Keep on the Borderlands, non-humans would suffer discrimination while staying at the keep, especially races like half-orcs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> likes to play with this trope a lot in general, using Creation's fictional societies as thought experiments or deliberate juxtapositions to our own society. Specific examples:
<ul><li> The 1e sourcebook "Manacle and Coin" includes both an exhaustive listing of races generally considered "slave races" and a sidebar from the authors about how utterly WRONG such attitudes are.
</li><li> The Scarlet Dynasty, which rules the Realm, has a eugenics program built around increasing the likelihood of Dragon-Blooded Exaltation. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> since the Realm's Dragon-Blooded are the only Realm citizens capable of naturally wielding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Essence</a>, and thus are regarded as the Realm's most valuable resource.
</li><li> The Delzahn have an odd attitude when it comes to sexuality and gender. On the one hand, anyone can "take the grey" and declare themselves "dereth," effectively becoming the opposite sex, starting at the time of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiteOfPassage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiteOfPassage">Rite of Passage</a>. On the other hand, they have <em>extremely</em> strict gender norms, with no allowance for homosexuality or "abnormal" behavior. So if you're a gay man and want to be in a relationship with another man, either you or your partner must become dereth. If you're a woman and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">you want to fight or hunt for a living,</a> or are a man <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy">and want to paint</a>, you have to become dereth. And so on.
</li><li> Lookshy is probably the closest that Creation has to a real-life liberal democracy, with an enforced ban on slavery, a degree of social mobility and some notion of natural human rights. It's still a military-run police state with Dragon-Blooded at the top, and readily engages in economic imperialism (as well as regular, military-backed imperialism).

This is fully intentional, in an effort to draw a "true" portrait of feudal Japanese culture rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThemeParkVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThemeParkVersion">something a bit less alien</a>.
</li><li> On the flip side of the coin, many players may be offended when learning about Shourido, the dark "alternative" to Bushido that is advocated by agents of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mordor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mordor">the Shadowlands.</a> It's absolutely portrayed as an evil philosophy, but includes such "evil" ideas as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm">learning for the sake of learning,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">seeking to become stronger</a> and being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerfectionist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerfectionist">a perfectionist.</a> (In this case, mind, part of the point of Shourido is that it <em>looks</em> innocent on the surface, but inevitably draws its practitioners towards nasty extremes.)
</li><li> Aside philosophical issues, the setting's strict caste system is no doubt an example of this trope. Peasants are considered "half-people" and Eta (untouchables who handle "dirty work" like waste management) aren't considered people at all. Caste is determined by birth, and aside from being reincarnated into a higher caste in another life, there are very few ways to change caste. While some of the clans in the game are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceToTheWaiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceToTheWaiter">Nice to the Waiter</a> and endeavor to treat peasants with some dignity, they are, even by these people considered lesser. All this is, of course, profoundly uncomfortable to a western (particularly American) audience, where equality, or at least merit based social positioning is considered the norm.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FATAL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FATAL">FATAL</a></em>: Half of all men are rapists, (and recieve less punishment for this than keeping a disorderly house) women are considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiledForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiledForever">Defiled Forever</a> for being raped and prostitution is accepted and common. The author flip-flops between saying it's "controversial humour" or that this applies to all of Europe for all of its history because of one book about prostitution in 1400's.

Factor in alien cultures and things get real awkward real fast.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheWorldOfDarkness">The World of Darkness</a></em> enforces values dissonance mechanically. Humans have a "humanity" rating with a hierarchy of sins forming a ten-point scale (e.g. 10 is thinking an unkind thought about someone who harms you, zero is committing genocide for entertainment, simple murder falls around 4 or so) with sins below your current rating potentially dropping the rating. The Humanity scale, used by humans, Prometheans and most vampires, is intended to encompass standard modern first-world morality, but other supernatural creatures get entirely different lists of sins:
<ul><li> Vampires can, under some circumstances, choose to reject mortal moral standards, and instead embrace a Path of Enlightenment. A Path is something which must be deliberately sought out, and embracing one is a long, painful and soul-shattering process. These Paths are exactly as alien as one would expect and while they may overlap with mortal morality they do so for vastly different reasons. A follower of the Path of Lilith, which espouses pain as the path to wisdom, would consider killing a human as immoral as a follower of Humanity would, but for the reason that dead humans can't feel pain, and would consider torturing a human to be laudable, since the pain so inflicted would bring the human closer to enlightenment. A follower of the Path of Caine would consider killing a human while feeding repugnant to the same level as a human would, say, nerve-gassing an orphanage, because such lack of self-control is anathema to those who seek to master the vampiric condition. Killing humans in other circumstances isn't even on the hierarchy, because humans are cattle and not worthy targets of vampiric moral consideration.
</li><li> Mages get wisdom, which includes the standard scale but adds in things related to your tendency to use your magic as a first resort. Minor sins include using magic to 'shortcut' daily tasks, major ones include intentionally invoking magical backlash.
</li><li> Werewolves have essentially the same sins, but in an entirely different order. Simple rudeness can be an extremely severe sin if you're disrespecting a packmate or elder, theft isn't a sin at all, murder is a relatively mild one that's only severe if you're hunting for sport, and cannibalism features prominently with an array of fine distinctions.
</li><li> Changelings mostly ditch the standard sins in favor of an extremely legalistic tangle of requirements to keep oaths explicitly stated. If you can rationalize your way around an oath so that you completely violate the intent while technically obeying the wording, that's a positive quality.
</li><li> Geniuses in the fanmade <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeniusTheTransgression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeniusTheTransgression">Genius: The Transgression</a></em> have a system representing their sense of attachment to humanity, with dings for cutting yourself off from other people either figuratively (spending a lot of time by yourself) or literally (heavy use of cybernetics) featuring prominently, as well as penalties for things that don't appear on the usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Karma Meter</a> because people don't really have the capability to do so frequently (such as creating life in the laboratory).

Even knowing the story is a deliberate satire of macho club culture of the 1970s, many modern-day viewers find it very uncomfortable seeing the characters talking about punching their wives or eighteen-year-old strippers like it's nothing more than a minor character flaw.

Slavery is still a thing, but most of the main characters are against it or indifferent at worst (even though this required a fair deal of artistic license; many of the characters in the play owned slaves in real life). Also, the play isn't shy about the limited opportunities for women, who couldn't vote ("It's 1800, ladies tell your husbands vote for Burr!") and had limited career options. The vivacious and opinionated Angelica Schuyler could have very well been an accomplished politician herself had she been born two centuries later, but during that time period, "[her] only job is to marry rich."

Possibly justified, as the suicide note JD faked for Kurt and Ram painted them as having hid their "gay forbidden love" from a disapproving world, though the fact that the first assumptions their fathers make are "rhinestones, disco, pearly necklaces and Judy Garland" is still pretty telling.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Lizzie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Lizzie">Lizzie</a></em> is set in 1892, so the antiquated social mores of the Victorian era are in full swing. Alice is forced to keep her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LipstickLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LipstickLesbian">sexuality</a> secret, because anyone finding out could lead to her relationships, prospects, and possibly her entire life being ruined. Bridget assumes that the murderer of the Bordens was "a lunatic, a foreigner, a beast." The most disturbing example, however, is that it's heavily implied that the townspeople know, or at least suspect, that Lizzie's father is raping her... and yet, <em>no one</em> has tried to help her. No calls to the police, no attempts at helping her escape, not even asking her if she's alright. Lizzie doesn't even consider asking anyone for help, either. Back in the Victorian era, people were <em>far</em> more likely to turn a blind eye to sexual assault and parental abuse, and if Lizzie had told, it's very possible she wouldn't have been believed or taken seriously.

In fact, the receiving of a girl's first slave is treated more like getting a new pet than anything else, with the mother telling the girls to "take care of them" and that it's a "big responsibility". However, in actual practice, the situation often seems to be "slavery" in name only. Given the general treatment of women during that time period, being a slave to an Amazon was probably a reasonably sweet deal.

In that universe, magic that permanently changes a person's sex is readily available, genuinely making one's sex a <em>choice</em> rather than something one is born with, so their views on sexism and gender roles are... different. It's noted that there is no stigma against transgender individuals or non-heterosexual romances in his world due to this magic being available. However, they fully embrace the idea that certain occupations are more suited for one sex over the other, and Magus looks down on a friend of his because she chose to pursue a career as a warrior while remaining female, saying that it's utterly absurd to make such a choice. Magus himself was born female, but changed his sex (and gender identity) upon choosing the path of a warrior, because "men make better fighters". This is rather sharply at odds with the modern Western ideal of no discrimination between the sexes regarding occupation.

The decade? The 1990s, where it was meant to be one of the more "progressive" decades but even a lot of staunch leftists and sexual libertines tended to mistreat homosexuals back then (albeit more in the "taunting and mocking" than "firing and blacklisting" sense, mind).
<ul><li> Season 4 gives BoJack's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">abusive mother</a> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> that just screams this trope. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedToBeASweetKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedToBeASweetKid">She was just a normal, happy little girl</a> whose older brother was killed during the World War II and her mother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcessiveMourning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcessiveMourning">went mad with grief</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> does this in the episode "Peter's Progress" showing Peter's ancestor Griffin Peterson first settling in the New World.
<div class="indent"><strong>Griffin:</strong> We will have equal rights for all. Except blacks, Asians, Hispanics, Jews, gays, women, Muslims. Uhmm... Everybody who's not a white man. And I mean white-white, so no Italians, no Polish, just people from Ireland, England, and Scotland. But only certain parts of Scotland and Ireland. Just full-blooded whites. No, you know what? Not even whites. Nobody gets any rights. Ahhh...America!
</div><ul><li> In the episode "Stuck Together, Torn Apart", Joe's new automated surveillance van is shown to have a feature where it deploys two mechanical arms to arrest a perpetrator. After Peter tries it out, Cleveland tries to do the same, but once the van detects Cleveland is black it marks him as a minority suspect, begins beating him with truncheons and plants a gun next to him.
</li><li> In "I Dream of Jesus" the Griffins go to a 50s themed restaurant. When Cleveland tries to enter the employees blast him away with a hose, but he fondly declares that it takes him back.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> had a weird case of this. To show that times have changed, there are a lot of cultural differences. Public nudity, polygamy, suicide, drug addiction (cf. the vending machines that sell crack cocaine and advertise it like a soda with words like "Delicious" and "Refreshing"), and cannibalism are all relatively normal while robosexuality (humans having romantic or sexual relationships with robots) and homosexual marriage are still taboo (cf. "A Taste of Freedom"'s scene where, after the Supreme Court ruled polygamy constitutional, Zoidberg's lawyer gets booed loudly after he says, "I can't wait to tell my husband!" Gay marriage is shown to be legal at least, as is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesAsMuchSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesAsMuchSenseInContext">marriage between ghosts and horses</a>), and sewer mutants are considered inferior genetic scum that have to live underground by law.
</li><li> A fantastic variation on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em>. Since gargoyles raise their young communally and Goliath is a traditionalist, his attitudes about parenting and children are different from the humans around him. He's willing to accept <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Thailog</a> since he's only one of three fathers, but has trouble with his biological daughter Angela since she insists that he is her only father.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em>:
<ul><li> The episode "Legends" was created as an homage to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">The Golden Age of Comic Books</a>, and features plot-lines and events taken whole-cloth from the earlier era. However, this does not always translate too well to the current age, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">Hawkgirl</a> is rather resistant when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick">Black Siren</a> asks for her help making cookies and letting "the men" talk. Later, John Stewart, the (black) Green Lantern, is not entirely sure how to react when he is told that he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreACreditToYourRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreACreditToYourRace">"a credit to [his] people."</a> Both statements were perfectly normal (even progressive) back in their proper age, when having black or female heroes at all was amazing, but cause discomfort when brought to modern people.
</li><li> The time the group has to travel back to WWII to stop Vandal Savage from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidJetpackHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidJetpackHitler">giving the Nazis a technological edge</a>, although this is downplayed: several characters are blatantly shocked that Wonder Woman and Hawkgirl are, well, women. Not much is <em>outright</em> said about John Stewart's presence as an African American showing up in the middle of a White battalion, but that is mostly because they are in the middle of being nailed by an artillery barrage, and he is handy with a submachine gun.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:

<div class="indent"><strong>Radioactive Man:</strong> Ah, these Laramie cigarettes give me the steady nerves I need to combat evil. <br/><strong>Fallout Boy:</strong> Gee willikers, Radioactive Man, wish I was old enough to smoke Laramie. <br/><strong>Radioactive Man:</strong> Sorry, Fallout Boy, not until you're sixteen.
</div></li><li> In the episode, "The Last Temptation of Krust", Krusty performs at a comedy festival, but not really having created any new material in years, his old bits are incredibly outdated, especially an extremely cringeworthy Asian stereotype. He almost retires after the negative responses.
</li><li> Invoked but subverted in "Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington"; Krusty's rival for congress shows an old sketch where he interprets insensitive stereotypes in a UN meeting (A strereotypical frenchman who stinks worse than his french cheese, a potheaded rastafarian from Jamaica and a San Francisco homosexual). Krusty tries to defend himself by saying that it was a different time... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHelpingYourCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHelpingYourCase">1998</a>.
</li><li> In the episode "Lisa's Wedding", which takes place fifteen years into the future, this quote from Marge shows what type of content will be acceptable to show on broadcast TV, and doubles as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitingTheHandHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitingTheHandHumor">Biting-the-Hand Humor</a>:
<div class="indent"><em>[Lying in bed with Homer while watching TV]</em> <br/><strong>Marge:</strong> Ugh! The Fox Network became a hardcore porn channel so gradually, I didn't even notice.
</div></li><li> The episode "Homer Is Where The Art Isn't", we see Manacek, an stereotypical 1970s-era P.I. whose attitudes towards women (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl">including knocking one out cold</a>) are now seen as incredibly misogynistic (specially considering that the episode aired at a time #MeToo and women's lib were hot topics, whereas the former did not exist during production).
</li><li> In "Stealing First Base", Bart asks Grandpa for help with his latest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek">Girl of the Week</a>, and Grandpa, working off 1940's-era logic, advises him to give her a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpKiss">"Shut Up" Kiss</a>. When Bart kisses the girl out of nowhere, she begins screaming and he gets suspended for sexual assault.

</div></li><li> In "Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts", Superintendent Chalmers takes over educating Bart, and later other troubled boys. Chalmers hasn't taught since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, and is disdainful of modern teaching practices. Although he does actually start to make progress with his students, he takes the boys on an unauthorised camping trip in the woods where Nelson is hurt. Chalmers thinks that the (admittedly minor) injuries are no big deal, and is stunned when he is fired.
</li><li> A lot of the humor around Mr. Burns centers around his bizarrely ancient standards of moral judgement, which run the gamut from Victorian England dandy to slaveholding confederate.
<div class="indent"><strong>Burns:</strong> (on Joe DiMaggio) It seems they've started letting ethnics into the big leagues.
</div></li></ul></li><li> <em>Time Pervs</em> (a recurring sketch on the short-lived sketch show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VH1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VH1">VH1</a> Ill-ustrated</em>) is about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">Bill Clinton</a>, Pee-Wee Herman and Larry Flint using a time-traveling wheelchair to perv out on hot women in history.
