</p><p>Sometimes, this comes about when the character will start using an accent for some reason or another. If the character knows what sort of accent they are going for then often it will sound nothing like it's supposed to. Another character will often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshade</a> this but it's not guaranteed.
</p><p>Other times this will be the character's natural accent. They may be an alien from Planet Z or perhaps just from another country. Odds are good other aliens won't use the same accent, though.
</p><p>Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">Reality Is Unrealistic</a> may come into play here. Accents can be blended and merged depending on the geographic history of the individual and whether they were raised bilingual or not. Some accents may not be considered what is typical but may be truth in television regardless. And multiple times actors will speak with their natural accents and become the standard to compare to all other accents. For instance think of Paul Hogan of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CrocodileDundee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CrocodileDundee">Crocodile Dundee</a></em> or Steve Irwin of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CrocodileHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CrocodileHunter">Crocodile Hunter</a></em>, when most Australians have accents more refined than that. Or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanConnery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanConnery">Sean Connery</a>, whose Scottish accent is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SelfDemonstrating/SeanConnery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SelfDemonstrating/SeanConnery">unique only to him</a>.

Her accent isn't quite North American, isn't quite British, isn't quite Irish, isn't quite Australian, but somehow manages to have overtones of all four. Is her accent contrived to sound "global"? Because she manages this, probably without intending to. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wNUA5FuUqU">Here, have a listen.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Symbicort, a medicine that treats COPD, has a series of commercials in which a rotating cast of actors play an old man telling "The Three Little Pigs" and his grandson commenting on the old man's inability to "huff and puff." In one of them, the grandson has an accent that sounds simultaneously British, Australian, and Russian. Overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedAccent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedAccent">Unexplained Accent</a>, as no one else in the family speaks with an accent anywhere close to his.

Alternatively, it can be described as a texan trying to put on a surfer dude accent.

Most notably, Molly/Naru's inexplicable Boston/Brooklyn hybrid <strong>in the middle of Japan</strong>. Note that HER MOTHER has no trace of this accent at all. Amy/Ami also has something that sounds like Mid-Atlantic meets generic Eastern European meets generic British.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note188zd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note188zd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note188zd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Amy's original voice actress was, in fact, English <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBrit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBrit">(unlike Luna's)</a>, so what came out was her attempt to sound more North American; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">subsequent Amys</a> were asked to imitate that.</span> Not to mention Chad/Yuuichirou's... surfer accent?

With both voices, it was more pronounced upon him saying certain words, like "nothing", "understand" and "unbelievable". However, since <em>Dragon Ball Z Kai</em>, Sabat now speaks with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GutturalGrowler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GutturalGrowler">much lower and raspier voice</a> for Vegeta and his British accent is strongly downplayed.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">4Kids</a> dub did this a <em><strong>lot</strong></em>, much to everyone's consternation.
<ul><li> They gave Shanks a ridiculous accent that's really hard to determine. Fans can't tell whether he's supposed to sound Irish, Cockney English, Scottish, or Australian.
</li><li> The accent they gave Mihawk is just as weird, as he switches between French and Spanish. Sometimes, he even sounds like a mixture of the two.
</li><li> Krieg is apparently supposed to sound German, but it comes off as generically Central European.
</li><li> Robin is  at least in 4Kids world  meant to have a Texan accent, but poor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VeronicaTaylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VeronicaTaylor">Veronica Taylor</a> can't affect a Southern accent to save her life, so the result is every flavor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth">Deep South</a> all at once.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation">Funimation</a> dub, Foxy has an accent that sounds quite a lot like Don Karnage (see below). Of course, considering how over-the-top this character is supposed to be, this isn't a bad thing. Some actually find that his accent helps a lot of the comedy.
</li></ul></li><li> In the American dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a>,</em> Nando speaks with a European accent that shifts variously between Hispanic, Irish, and Scottish.
</li><li> In the English dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>, the voice actors speak with accents appropriate for the characters they play (England has an English accent, France has a French one, etc.). From the start though, it was determined that the accents would be just as over-the-top and stereotypical as everything else on the show is, so quite a few aren't exactly convincing.

That Hicox speaks perfect High German (the equivalent of BBC newscaster English) with no dialectal variations at all is a bit fishy, if perhaps not enough to comment on. However, he also has an accent which, while not strong enough to be immediately identifiable as English, is still not a commonly heard German one. Together, these things become highly suspicious.</span>

Most of the characters are Cajuns (Louisianans of French-Canadian descent) in 1850s Louisiana, but their accents evoke an unlikely mishmash of ethnicities from all over Europe and the Americas (one of the characters sounds almost Hispanic/Latino at one point, while Belizaire himself edges close to what sounds like a Scottish accent in one scene). This discrepancy can be attributed to two things: one, most North Americans have never heard an authentic Cajun accent and/or have a stereotyped idea of what it sounds like; and two, the Cajuns really <em>were</em> a multi-ethnic and even multi-racial people, despite primarily speaking French. (This is discussed further over at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaginCajun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaginCajun">Ragin' Cajun</a>.)

Ayelet Zurer stated that she wanted the character to seem international, and given that she's an Italian citizen who works in Geneva and is shown speaking Italian, French, and English and reading Latin, it's somewhat justified.

Ma's North Carolina accent doesn't help matters either, y'all. Between this and Nell's other family circumstances, her speech is so strange and incomprehensible that it can barely even be called English anymore.

Not only is the accent quite distracting but the character is a terrible chatterbox. The film's setting is quite vague, it's based on a British children's book, filmed in Australia, but all the cast are either American or do American accents (presumably to appeal to US audiences). Though the world it's set in doesn't feel like America at all but more like the English countryside.

To most people however, his accent is a bizarre mix that sounds more Cockney than anything else.

However, when she plays the Latina immigrant in the 1970s story, her accent doesn't sound Spanish at all.
</li><li> In the original 1970 version of <em>The Out-of-Towners</em>, Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis play a couple from Ohio, but their accents are more suggestive of New York or New Jersey.

Adam's fake Russian accent sounds nothing like a real Russian accent.
</li><li> Rod Steiger shows a tendency whenever he tries a foreign accent. One particularly strange example comes in the Western <em>Run of the Arrow</em>, where he decides to play an ex-Confederate Southerner with an inexplicable (and quite painful) Irish brogue. Or his cartoon Mexican accent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DuckYouSucker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DuckYouSucker">Duck, You Sucker!</a></em>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastStand">The Last Stand</a></em>, Peter Stormare sports a bizarre accent that seems to mix his native Swedish heritage with a Deep Southern drawl.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AfterEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AfterEarth">After Earth</a></em> has every character speak in accents that are almost completely unrecognizable and jarring to anyone who hears them. The two main characters speak in what can probably be described as an offshoot of a South African accent while every other character has...an accent. The accents aren't even consistent with each other outside Will and Jayden Smith's a good portion of the time. They apparently went to linguists to try to nail down an accent that might come about in the future, but as YMS put it, it comes across as "part British, part Southern (American), and part completely f*cking random." It also makes the characters come off as less intelligent than they are as a result.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gandhi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gandhi">Gandhi</a></em>: Geraldine James played Mira Behn. During production of the film, the director wouldn't let James meet the real Mira Behn. It turned out the real Mira Behn had a strange accent, the product of an aristocratic English upbringing, decades living in India, and twenty years or so in Austria. The director didn't want James copying Mira Behn's accent, because it would have resulted in this trope.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGunsOfNavarone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGunsOfNavarone">The Guns of Navarone</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardHarris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardHarris">Richard Harris</a> plays a RAAF squadron commander who doesn't sound like anything heard in Australia.
</li><li> Peter Sellers' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ThePinkPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ThePinkPanther">Inspector Clouseau</a> bears no resemblance whatsoever to any French accent, real or imaginary. Even other French characters find him unintelligible at times. At no point does he speak a single, actual French word (save that he does occasionally refer to people as <em>monsieur</em> or <em>madame</em>).
</li><li> For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneWithTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneWithTheWind">Gone with the Wind</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClarkGable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClarkGable">Clark Gable</a> began researching an authentic old Charleston accent in order to play Rhett Butler. However, he quickly gave up upon realizing nobody would be able to tell where the character was supposed to be from, or what he was saying: "Frinkly, moi dyah, oi don' give a dim!"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryCrews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryCrews">Terry Crews</a>' African accent in <em>Blended</em> sounds more Jamaican than African.

However, the Judean People's Front speak in a completely different and affected accent. It's supposed to be a German accent since their leader was originally going to be a parody of Adolf Hitler. All of the scenes setting this up got cut, leaving only the inexplicable accent.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKarateKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKarateKid">The Karate Kid</a></em>: Subversion by way of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">Reality Is Unrealistic</a>. The film gets a lot of flak for Mr. Miyagi's stereotypically mangled English, but Pat Morita actually quite accurately copied the accent of his stunt double Fumio Demura, who was a recent immigrant from Okinawa.
</li><li> Warwick, the human antagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GraveyardShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GraveyardShift">Graveyard Shift</a></em>. Sometimes it sounds like a parody of Fred Gwynne's Maine accent in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PetSematary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PetSematary">Pet Sematary</a></em> movie, other times... it doesn't.
</li><li> There's no indication Quint from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws">Jaws</a></em> is from anywhere but Amity Island, but he has an accent somewhere between Irish and rural Maine, completely unlike anyone else in the film, or anyone else on Earth.
</li><li> Christabella Andreoli from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDevilsAdvocate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDevilsAdvocate">The Devil's Advocate</a></em> first shows up speaking italian, which leads people to believe she's supposed to be from Italy, but, there's no explanation for the way she talks in <em>english</em>. Or maybe there is, considered she's supposed to be the devil's daughter. The actress portraying her is Dutch. Though, to be fair, Keanu's southern accent also leaves a lot to be desired.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayMilland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayMilland">Ray Milland</a> in 1974's <em>Gold</em> is supposed to be playing a South African mine owner.

</li><li> The lovely Yvonne Romain was actually British, but her dark looks often got her cast in exotic foreign roles in 1950s and '60s British TV and movies. This may explain why, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainClegg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainClegg">Captain Clegg</a></em>, playing an English village barmaid brought up in the country from infancy, she sometimes slips into some kind of European accent.
</li><li> Linda Low in the film version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FlowerDrumSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FlowerDrumSong">Flower Drum Song</a></em> is supposed to be a native San Franciscan, but speaks with a clipped British-Chinese accent that doesn't sound like anyone else in the film, much less someone born-and-raised in California. Actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NancyKwan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NancyKwan">Nancy Kwan</a> was from Hong Kong, and her accent's a standard upper-class Hong Kong dialect of the time.

And furthermore, I would guess thatbeing as how he grew up in territories controlled by the Britishthat he carries a British passport and was drafted into their military when the war started and is now part of ANZAC."

Problem is, he did it on the cheap and ended up receiving RNA from a Vulcan student who attended Cambridge and then went to UCLA. By book's end, his own Southern drawl has slipped into the mix.

</li><li> Most of the accents of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall">Redwall</a></em> are easy to place, if not always intelligible, being thick British provincial and class stereotypes. Some vermin, however, have more unusual accents. Most notable are the Pure Ferrets from <em>Triss</em>; their accent is <em>probably</em> supposed to be quasi-Slavic, based on their names (Bladd, Kurda, etc.), but sounds more like German spoken through a mouthful of marbles and with a random "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkLikeAPirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkLikeAPirate">yar!</a>" sprinkled in.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RiverOfTeeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RiverOfTeeth">River of Teeth</a></em>, several characters are irked by being unable to place Houndstooth's accent, especially since he's known to be from Britain and they expected him to sound British. They also tend to dismiss his explanation that his accent is unplaceable because he's spent decades in the United States by that point, and in different areas of it at that.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFifthSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFifthSeason">The Fifth Season</a></em>, Schaffa has a unique accent that several characters remark on.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PatriotGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PatriotGames">Patriot Games</a></em>, Dr. Shapiro is described as having a curious accent as the result of his upbringing; he was originally from Brooklyn, but moved to South Carolina and was educated in Texas, and ended up speaking with an accent that combines elements of all three locations.

<ul><li> Ian Curtis of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoyDivision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoyDivision">Joy Division</a> often sang songs in a fake American accent, which retained so many of his native Manchester inflections that it typically provokes this reaction in UK listeners. When the group reformed as New Order after his death, Bernard Sumner took on the vocals in his natural accent specifically to avoid comparisons.
</li><li> Lena (winner of the 2010 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest">Eurovision Song Contest</a>, actually from Germany) caused some confusion with her accent. While definitely not German it ran all over the place. She claims her teacher had a Cockney accent, but while there are certainly traces of it in her singing, it's not the whole story.
</li><li> Fans were indeed asking the trope question when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eminem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eminem">Eminem</a> came in full force with his trademark accent for his album <em>Relapse</em>. Later in his succeeding albums, Eminem implies he sort of went overboard with it.
</li><li> For a while, after she married Guy Ritchie, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madonna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madonna">Madonna</a> seemed to adopt some bizarre, half-assed attempt at a British accent.

She later admitted it had to do with her anxiety and dealing with her newfound fame, dropping the accent entirely.
</li><li> The two lead singers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ACDC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ACDC">AC/DC</a> (the late Bon Scott and, currently, Brian Johnson) are (or, in Scott's case, <em>were</em>) a Scotsman and an Englishman, respectively, the former raised in Australia, and each trying to imitate American rock 'n' roll singers. This can make their accents on AC/DC records sound quite bizarre, or even unintelligible. (On <em>Back in Black</em>, for instance, Johnson, trying to imitate Scott, sings "explode you to Mars" in some bastardized British/Australian/American dialect, and it comes out sounding like "explode you two miles.")
</li><li> For the first few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRamones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRamones">Ramones</a> albums, Joey (who, like the rest of the band, was from Forest Hills, Queens) seems to be putting on some sort of British accent while singing, which he later dropped.
<ul><li> Billie Joe Armstrong was guilty of this on the early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GreenDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GreenDay">Green Day</a> albums too.
</li><li> At times, Tom Delonge of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blink182" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blink182">blink-182</a> seems to mix a Cockney London accent with his native Californian accent.
<ul><li> This phenomenon was fairly common with American punk-rock bands, because of the strong influence of British groups like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SexPistols" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SexPistols">Sex Pistols</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheClash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheClash">The Clash</a>.

Granted, British pop musicians who fake American accents are often no better.
</li><li> Lene Lovich sang in a bizarre German influenced accent, despite speaking in an upper-class English accent in real life. The voice is evident in her famous song New Toy, on which she collaborated with Thomas Dolby.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Charlemagne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>: By the Sword and the Cross</em>, Young Charlemagne, Einhard, the Pope, and the male chorus (but <em>not</em> Hildegarde or the older Charlemagne read by Lee) all put on a bizarre mock German accent, but clearly struggling to keep it up while singing, end up sounding as Scandinavian as they do German. The idea only lasts for that album, with the single version of "Bloody Verdict of Verden" and what new vocals feature on <em>Omens of Death</em> all done in the performers' native accents.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaveMatthewsBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaveMatthewsBand">Dave Matthews</a> was born in South Africa, spent his childhood in New York (and, briefly, England), moved back to South Africa in his teen years, and then left for Virginia when he graduated high school to avoid being conscripted into the South African army. His accent, especially early in his career, became an odd blend of South African, New England, and Mid-Atlantic.
</li><li> If you listen to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FiveSecondsOfSummer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FiveSecondsOfSummer">5 Seconds of Summer's</a> material, they sound reasonably American...until they have parts where they talk during songs (Good Girls' line, "I swear, she lives in that library") coming across as their native Australian, or some weird pronunciation quirks of their natural accents slipping through when they're singing. Anyone unfamiliar with their country of origin might be confused when listening to some of their songs. Then there's the cello line from the beginning of the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FfG_5JBVBQ">Good Girls<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>' music video. What accent was he going for? Australian? British? The school principal also sounded like some type of British person attempting an American accent...kinda poorly, while the other two guys who spoke in their native Australian accents. In fact, one could argue that they try <em>too</em> hard in some of their songs to sound American, to annoying levels.

But when he sings, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingingVoiceDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingingVoiceDissonance">something weird happens</a>.

<ul><li> The Job Board guy appears to have an accent that is not of Earth.

<ul><li> <em>PaRappa the Rapper 2</em> features several boss characters who have weirdly foreign accents that don't seem to be from anywhere in particular. Even the accent of Chop Chop Master Onion, which is plausibly Asian in the first game, seems to decay in a somewhat more ambiguous direction as the series goes on.
</li><li> Also from <em>PaRappa the Rapper 2</em> is Hairdresser Octopus, who manages to sound Mexican Spanish and Indian (as in the region of Asia) at the same time at all times. That being said, as he is in the makeover business, it is possible he intentionally speaks in a strange accent as part of his public image.

<ul><li> The Scout brings an interesting variation of this trope into the mix; his accent reeks of the Bronx, but his backstory says he is from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Southies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Southies">South Boston,</a></em> which a Bronx accent sounds almost nothing like.

Even the Developer's Toolset is unhelpful: while Leliana's (Orlesian) accent is listed as "hint of French", Zevran's (Antivan) accent is "slightly Spanish", and Wynne's (Ferelden) accent is "possibly British-sounding", Sten's accent is just "Qunari" with absolutely no explanation of what a Qunari might sound like. This may be intentional, as Qunari are extremely picky about displaying complete mastery of any skill they attempt, and so speaking with an identifiable accent would be <em>doing it wrong</em>. For most of them, this makes sense since they speak in a very precise, deliberate manner, but The Iron Bull from Inquisition has the same accent despite having a much more natural speaking style otherwise.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7vtny');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7vtny" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7vtny');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Well, almost; his informal manner of speaking will occasionally be inflected with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FreddiePrinzeJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FreddiePrinzeJr">his voice actor's</a> dialect, sometimes even dipping into the Hispanic/Puerto Rican accent Prinze used for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Vega</a>.</span>

Given the bizarreness of the accent, the effort this implies maintaining it took is understandable, even if the reason for having it in the first place isn't.

A "Plegian accent" is mentioned in-story early on... except none of the other characters from Plegia (Gangrel, Tharja and Henry) speak like this.

But on the rare occasions where a character has to impersonate the enemy, things go... south. (For instance, the beginning of the "The Foundry" flashpoint has a glorious demonstration of Imperial characters trying-but-not-really-trying to put on a Republic accent.)

<ul><li> Rarity's accent could be considered a parody of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBrit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBrit">pretentious characters failing to imitate Posh Received Pronunciation</a>, or "Mid-Atlantic" as a compromise between American and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishAccents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishAccents">British Accents</a>. The accent could quite possibly be an affectation of the character herself  she is obsessed with aristocratic high culture yet lives in the small provincial town of Ponyville, and neither her parents (seen in "Sisterhooves Social") nor her little sister Sweetie Belle speak with any trace of this accent. In fact, in her flashback during "Cutie Mark Chronicles", filly-Rarity is shown to not have the accent.
<ul><li> Rarity's voice actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TabithaStGermain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TabithaStGermain">Tabitha St. Germain</a> herself has this issue. During interviews, her accent often shifts between Canadian and vaguely British to South African? Apparently, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanOfAThousandVoices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanOfAThousandVoices">Woman of a Thousand Voices</a> takes its toll after a while.
</li><li> The South African part may be attributed to the fact that Tabitha grew up in South Africa.
</li></ul></li><li> In fact, Sweetie Belle is the only one in her family who <em>doesn't</em> have an exaggerated accent: Rarity's father sounds like he's from Chicago or Milwaukee, while her mother's accent suggests either New Jersey or New York.
</li><li> Photo Finish from "Green Isn't Your Color" has a vaguely Germanic accent, presumably because her voice actress (the above-mentioned Tabitha) was doing a vocal caricature of Anna Wintour (although most of the younger kids watching would most likely compare her to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles">Edna Mode</a>).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10e9ij');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10e9ij" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10e9ij');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Photo Finish's accent is actually similar to that of designer Karl Lagerfeld, who was the inspiration for the pony Hoity-Toity whose accent is similar to Anna Wintour's. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Make sense? Yeah we didn't think so either</a>.</span>
</li><li> Zecora's accent seems to be some sort of vague "generic African accent", crossed with "vague Caribbean islander accent". The character's native language is a kind of faux-Swahili the creators jokingly claimed is "native Zebra", so presumably it's a Zebra accent.
</li><li> The spa ponies' (Aloe and Lotus Blossom) accents sound somewhere between Indian and German, but not quite either. For added confusion, it is probably meant to be French or Eastern European (the toys they're based on was sold only in Eastern Europe).
</li><li> The Breezies have their own language that sounds like a strange blend between Scottish and Swedish, which carries into the accent of Seabreeze, the only Breezie able to speak English.

</li><li> Moe Szyslak the bartender speaks in a generalized "crotchety old man" accent that could represent many different American regions or ethnicities. Over the course of the series, it's been hinted that he might be of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast">Italian, Arab, Dutch, or Russian descent</a> (though his last name looks Hungarian or Polish).

It's a manner of speaking that Tony's voice actor, Chicago-born Joe Mantegna, has perfected.
</li><li> Dr. Nick is supposed to be an immigrant from somewhere, but where is never specified, and his accent is hard to place. His last name, Riviera, could be Spanish or Italian, but at times his manner of speaking has a more Eastern European, Yakov Smirnoff-vibe. Hank Azaria has claimed different inspirations for the character over the years, including Cuban-born Ricky Ricardo, of "I Love Lucy" fame and TV executive Gabor Csupo (of the Klasky Csupo animation studio, the original Simpsons animators), who is Hungarian.
</li><li> In "Bart vs. Australia", the Simpson family travels to Australia. Many Australian viewers, however, thought the Australian accents shown in the episode sounded more like Cockney or South African accents.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SomeLikeItHot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SomeLikeItHot">Some Like It Hot</a></em>, Tony Curtis does a perfect impersonation of Grant's strangled vowels, only to be told to stop being ridiculous, because '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">nobody talks like that</a>'.

This resulted in an accent that can be accurately described as hailing from The United States of England.
</li><li> William F. Buckley Jr., conservative author, and commentator, who was born to upper-class Southern parents and raised partially in Europe, had a unique accent. It was halfway between New England English and Standard English, with a slight Southern drawl tone.

When he gave Dutch-language interviews to Dutch television in his final years, he still spoke grammatically correct Dutch, but had a noticeable American accent and often paused to think how to express himself.

According to his friend (and <em>The Room</em> co-star) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregSestero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregSestero">Greg Sestero</a>'s book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDisasterArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDisasterArtist">The Disaster Artist</a></em>, Wiseau is originally from an Eastern European country (later confirmed by documentarian Rick Harper to be Poland, and publicly revealed after Wiseau lost a lawsuit against the latter in 2020), under the name Piotr Wieczorkiewicz. He moved to France for political reasons and spoke French all the time, then moved to live with relatives in French part of New Orleans, USA where he learned English, then moved to San Francisco where he picked up American mannerisms (he felt that if he studied Sestero's audition videos, he might be able to talk like him).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanConnery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanConnery">Sean Connery</a>'s accent is a weird mishmash of Scottish and Welsh, as he grew up between both nations, which has been increasingly impacted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SelfDemonstrating/SeanConnery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SelfDemonstrating/SeanConnery">a growing speech impediment</a> throughout his career.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GraceKelly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GraceKelly">Grace Kelly</a>'s accent, over time. She grew up in Philadelphia, but to a decidedly upper-class family and was likely coached on how to speak from an early age. Combined with living much of her life abroad from her 20's on, by the later end of her life, her usual accent was a rather puzzling mix between American, affected "English", and continental European-speaking-English.
</li><li> Leopold Stokowski, a British conductor of Polish and Irish ancestry who gained fame in America, spoke with a peculiar accent that was neither British, Polish nor Irish (and certainly not American) most of his career. In fact, despite his birth records indicating London birth, he claimed to be originally from various parts of Poland (or other parts of Eastern Europe). Some of this may have been a deliberate act due to influence from his first wife, American pianist Olga Samaroff (who adopted HER name mostly to advance her career, despite having no Russian heritage<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12zp5r');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12zp5r" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12zp5r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> she was briefly married to a Russian while studying music in Europe and in fact had a pair of rather awkward names: both her birth name Lucy Hickenlooper and temporarily married Russian name Loutzky.</span>).
</li><li> Illich Guardiola, a voice actor for many dubbed anime from ADV Films and Funimation, has a unique accent. He was born in Honduras to a half-Russian mother and half-Italian father. They moved to Boston when he was young, and then moved again, this time to College Station, Texas when he was 13. So, it's Honduran, Bostonian, and Texan, with a bit of Russian and Italian thrown in.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Layla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Layla">Layla El</a> is British born (of Moroccan and Spanish descent) yet has lived in Miami for many years. So her accent is a weird blend between cockney, RP, and generic American. Sometimes in her promos, she deliberately puts on an RP voice but some American pronunciations slip through.
</li><li> Like Layla before her, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Maryse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Maryse">Maryse</a> (who is French-Canadian) sounds noticeably more American now than she did in her early years. Perhaps justifiably so since English isn't her first language and she's had many years to become more fluent. She still has a bit of a French twang though.
</li><li> Former Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien is from Quebec, but due to nerve damage on the left side of his face, he ended up with an accent and speech patterns that are utterly unlike Quebecois, Canadian English, or any recognized combination of the two. During his term of office, it was often joked - often by himself - that he is "fluent in neither of Canada's official languages."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheJerrySpringerShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheJerrySpringerShow">Jerry Springer</a> was born in England, spent his childhood in Queens, New York, and spent his adult life in Cincinnati and Chicago. He sounds like a mix between Queens and the Midwest.
</li><li> Journalist <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattTaibbi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattTaibbi">Matt Taibbi</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/greed-and-debt-the-true-story-of-mitt-romney-and-bain-capital-20120829?page=5">once hypothesized<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that one of the reasons that Mitt Romney had so much trouble in his 2012 Presidential campaign was because for all his talk about all the places he'd lived and worked, he had no discernible accent that would tie him to any of those places, and this contributed to voters' perceptions of him as "fake".
<div class="indent"><em>"Listen to Mitt Romney speak, and see if you can notice what's missing. This is a man who grew up in Michigan, went to college in California, walked door to door through the streets of southern France as a missionary and was a governor of Massachusetts, the home of perhaps the most instantly recognizable, heavily accented English this side of Edinburgh. Yet not a trace of any of these places is detectable in Romney's diction. None of the people in any of those places bled in and left a mark on the man."</em>
</div></li><li> Former New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean's accent sounds almost, but not quite, like he admired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> so much he wanted to talk like him — or like he wanted to suppress a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Joisey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Joisey">Joisey</a> accent and overcorrected. A <a class="urllink" href="http://governors.rutgers.edu/on-governors/nj-governors/governor-thomas-h-keans-administration/governor-thomas-h-kean-biography">capsule biography<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> attributes it to overcoming a childhood stutter with the help of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritsWithBattleships" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritsWithBattleships">Royal Navy veteran</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillBryson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillBryson">Bill Bryson</a> has spent roughly equal parts of his life living in his native US and his wife's home country of the UK, and so has pretty much the most perfect example of a transatlantic accent you're ever likely to hear. Listening to him do the occasional voice-over on TV, it becomes clear why he doesn't often read the audio versions of his own books: even though he's articulate and interesting, that accent can get <em>very</em> distracting.
</li><li> Stewart Copeland of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePolice">The Police</a> is American but spent almost his entire childhood living abroad. Even in adulthood, he spent a lot of time in the UK. His accent is noticeably American but noticeably softer than the typical American accent, with significant influences from British English.
</li><li> Pro wrestler Vampiro has spent most of his career in Mexico. Even though he is a Canadian, he now speaks English with a slight Mexican accent!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeanuReeves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeanuReeves">Keanu Reeves</a>. Moving around the US and Canada as a child has left him with an indistinguishable accent.
</li><li> British news reporter Lyse Doucet, originally from Canada, has become nationally famous for her indeterminate accent, which has been frequently parodied.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lorde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lorde">Lorde</a> has spent so much time abroad in the United States from her native New Zealand since rising to fame that her accent has clearly been Americanized.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CraigFerguson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CraigFerguson">Craig Ferguson</a> did a week of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLateLateShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLateLateShow">The Late Late Show</a></em> in Scotland in 2012, it became obvious listening to the natives of his old stomping grounds in greater Glasgow how much his accent has become Americanized. In fact, CBS felt the need to give a lot of the Scots subtitles.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GillianAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GillianAnderson">Gillian Anderson</a> was born in the US, but she moved to England when she was 2 and didn't move back until she was 11, and by then, her speech patterns had been set. It wasn't until she was out of high school that she tried to shed the accent. In the very early episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em>, she'll <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OohMeAccentsSlipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OohMeAccentsSlipping">slip</a> occasionally. In the 2008 movie, it can get quite noticeable in Scully's emotional scenes, as Anderson moved back to England after the show ended in 2002, and had to relearn her American accent all over again for the film. She's had to do this again for the revival series and has said doing so is why she sounds so hoarse at times.
</li><li> Linguist David Crystal and his son, actor Ben Crystal, have spent years <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPlpphT7n9s">reconstructing what the English used at the time of Shakespeare would have sounded like<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (called "Original Pronunciation"). When Ben acts out a scene using OP and then asks audience members what it sounds like, he gets answers ranging from Scottish, Yorkshire, West Country, Irish, Australian, and <em>Canadian</em>, and sometimes like a non-English speaker trying to fake one of those accents.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurCClarke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurCClarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a> was British, but he spent the latter half of his life in Sri Lanka, with lots of traveling to Britain and America. As a result, he had a unique patchwork accent which had a British base but lots of little oddities (like heavily emphasizing the letter R).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeSPatton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeSPatton">George S. Patton</a> was born and raised in California but both of his parents had deep Virginia roots, so there were strong traces of an aristocratic Tidewater lilt in his voice. Since that's not a very well-known accent, some of his peculiarities (like pronouncing "first" as "foist") are really hard to place if you don't know his background.
</li><li> Inverted by 20th-century science writer Willy Ley. His friends said his German accent actually became thicker in his later years, <em>after</em> he had moved to the U.S. full-time. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a> told the story of someone who had to introduce Ley before a speech whether he liked his name pronounced beginning with a "w" or a "v". Ley responded, "<em>Veelee</em> oder Veelee, id makes no difference."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecordProducer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecordProducer">Record Producer</a> Patrice Wilson of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Friday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Friday">Friday</a>" infamy has a very strange accent, which is the product of him growing up in Nigeria, spending his teenage years touring Eastern Europe, and moving to America as an adult.
</li><li> Actor and comedian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KumailNanjiani" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KumailNanjiani">Kumail Nanjiani</a> was born in Pakistan and moved to the United States at the age of 18. His accent has been heavily Americanized to the point where he's turned down roles where he has to exaggerate a stereotypical Indian accent.
</li><li> Accents change over time, so news clips and other old media can invoke this for people more accustomed to modern accents. ABC News Australia has a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn2RjxYNpcawS9C6GGuzTTGQGgCkm_krB">Youtube playlist<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of old clips from the 1950s through 1980s and one of the most asked questions is why Australians in the 1960s sounded British instead of Australian.
