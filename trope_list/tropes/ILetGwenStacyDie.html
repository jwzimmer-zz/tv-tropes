<ul><li> Ango from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds">7 Seeds</a></em> blames himself for Shigeru's death - thinking that if he had not been injured, he could've not been such a load when it was necessary. He also blames himself for Mayu's death, among other people who died during the Final Test, mostly because he feels he should've <em>told</em> them that the test would mean "Live Or Die" for all of them, though Shigeru's death is the biggest one for him and the one he blames himself the most about.
</li><li> The news of Katie's death hits hard <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Alyosha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Alyosha">Alyosha!</a></em>, for the first time feeling anger and pain for the death of anyone. Fortunately, it was just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath">Disney Death</a>.
</li><li> Eren Yeager from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> seems to be collecting them. As a child, he was helpless to save his mother from being eaten by a Titan. Years later, he becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixthRanger">The Sixth Ranger</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSquad">The Squad</a>, a team of exceptionally skilled soldiers known as the Special Operations Squad. On their first mission together, he's repeatedly asked to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfTrust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfTrust">believe</a> in them and not take on the Female Titan. He decides to do just that, leaving them to face the Female Titan alone and watches helplessly from a distance as the entire squad is wiped out. He immediately blames himself for making the wrong decision and goes on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a>.
<ul><li> Thankfully, he narrowly avoids this happening with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Armin, after convincing Levi that his friend should be saved instead of Erwin. Several of the other characters, however, feel that this is a "You Let Gwen Stacy Die" moment, and think that Erwin should've been saved instead.</span>
</li><li> Reiner Braun feels <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure">eternally guilty</a> about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">not being able to save his friend Marcel, who possessed the powers of the Jaw Titan, from being eaten by Ymir. It caused him to develop somewhat of a split personality because he couldn't shoulder his responsibilities, which lead to him being seen as a cool big brother by Eren and the rest of the Survey Corps recruits (mostly). Marcel's brother Porco calls Reiner out on this after he becomes the host of the Jaw Titan and sees Ymir's memories. And now Reiner seems to be setting himself up for this <em>again</em>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> This happens with Casca of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>, where Femto (i.e Griffith) comes with an army of demons to decimate Guts' group; he then proceeds to capture and rape Casca in front of Guts, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch">who gets pinned down by one of the demons</a>. Casca is not killed but the event affects her so much that has basically the same funcion.
</li><li> Kai goes through this from episodes 16 and 27 of the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BakutenShootBeyblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BakutenShootBeyblade">Bakuten Shoot Beyblade</a></em> after Yūya's fate at the hands of an unstable digital bit-beast. Yūya looked up to Kai and wanted to hang out with him, but Kai kept him at a distance, to which the boy reacted by becoming a blader for Psychic and force Kai to acknowledge him that way.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ichigo transformed from a crybaby who got beat up by girls into a badass protector of everyone due to the death of his mother Masaki which he spent years thinking was his fault. The real cause of her death becomes very important to his decisions and behaviour in the final arc.
</li><li> Uryuu's resolve to protect people from hollows and also to work with a quincy's traditional enemies, shinigami, comes from guilt at being unable to save his grandfather's life despite having been a young child at the time. His (and especially his father Ryuuken's) behaviour is also deeply connected to the death of his mother, Kanae Katagiri, whose mysterious death becomes extremely important in the final arc and is also linked to the real cause of Masaki's death.
</li></ul></li><li> Luna in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CasshernSins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CasshernSins">Casshern Sins</a></em>. Casshern apparently killed her, causing the Ruin, and we are offered glimpses of his killing her at the beginning of every episode, although he doesn't remember any of it; his realization that he did it apparently causes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> which leads him to try to make amends.
<ul><li> Luna turns out to be alive later, but she also turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>, which leads the characters to question whether she is really Luna at all.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun">A Certain Scientific Railgun</a></em>, Mikoto starts going into a mix of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> and a rage when she sees <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her clones</span> get killed by Accelerator.
</li><li> Mary Magdalene's death in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a></em> is the main event in Chrono's background that drives a lot of his actions in the present. In the manga, her role is fleshed out and she has much more of a personality, but the anime gives her nothing more than a flashback in one episode, which weakens her as a character and gives her little more to do than to give Chrono a reason to angst.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/CLANNAD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/CLANNAD">CLANNAD</a></em>, after Tomoya Okazaki's wife Nagisa dies in childbirth, he regrets ever meeting her in the first place. He gets so bad that he barely looks at his daughter Ushio <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">for five years</a>, letting Nagisa's parents raise her instead. Getting over this forms the bulk of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> in the second half of <em>~After Story~</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymore</a></em>
<ul><li> Witnessing Teresa's death is the whole motivation that causes Clare to become a Claymore to begin with.
</li><li> Undine is also a shining example with Deneve as the Hero, and all the other Claymore who died in Pieta can be considered this.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> has at least Euphemia and Shirley, the latter eventually kick starts Lelouch's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit">Zero Requiem</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparedByTheAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparedByTheAdaptation">Though the movie version shows how it still would have happened if she lived.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em>: Julia becomes a Gwen Stacy during the final episode, and it leads Spike to his own (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod">possible</a>) death in a fight with his arch-nemesis, who also dies in the process.
</li><li> Leomon, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em>, could fall under this as a male example. Juri blamed herself for his death, and how she coped with it led to the D-Reaper almost destroying the world. She later realises what Leomon meant in his dying words to her (whether this lesson is about destiny or her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubInducedPlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubInducedPlotHole">having a lion's heart</a> depends on the region), and begins to fight back against the D-Reaper.
<ul><li> Wizardmon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em> is probably this for Gatomon, as even by season 02 when his digital ghost reappears, it still haunts her and the rest of the chosen children from the first series to this day.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>:
<ul><li> Future version of Rogue Cheney that appeared in Grand Magic Games arc suffered from this. In his timeline, he let Frosch get killed by Gray Fullbuster turned evil, leading Rogue to turn evil as well. After his defeat, but before returning to his timeline, he left a warning about the turning point and Natsu swore to prevent the tragedy.
</li><li> Another example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Zeref</a>, which lead to <em>his</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a>. When he found out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Mavis Vermillion</a> had the exact same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse">curse</a> he has - specifically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality">Complete Immortality</a> combined with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathRadius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathRadius">"Instant Death" Radius</a> designed to kill anyone he could ever care about - he fell in love with her due to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseYouWereNiceToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseYouWereNiceToMe">treating him with kindness</a>, and being the only person in the world who could ever truly understand him. The feelings were mutual, and they had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigDamnKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigDamnKiss">The Big Damn Kiss</a>... which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissOfDeath">killed her</a>. Zeref had killed the only person he thought he could ever safely allow himself to care about and be around, and worst of all, it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a> that did it. That would break <em>anybody.</em>

Despite defeating her murderer in the first TV special, Terry is still haunted by her death in the second special and movie. Even when Lily's soul comes to him and explicitly tells him to not grieve for him.
</li><li> Edward Elric has this in spades in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>. He was unable to revive his mother, the botched attempt to revive his mother cost his brother his body, and he wasn't able to do anything better than attaching his brother's soul to a suit of armor, and then he wasn't able to save Nina. On top of that, he has a considerable amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorGuilt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorGuilt">Survivor Guilt</a> from Hughes' death.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GuiltyCrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GuiltyCrown">Guilty Crown</a></em>, Hare is killed off in an explosion mostly to make Shu feel bad. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenFallenFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenFallenFriend">She's promptly forgotten about by the next episode.</a>

</li><li> The Gundam meta-series has used this trope a LOT.
<ul><li> Fllay Allster for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Kira Yamato</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em> and Stella Loussier for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Shinn Asuka</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em>. This is actually Shinn's second big loss as his entire family dies in episode 1 of <em>SEED Destiny</em>, which seems to justify his extreme skill as a mobile suit pilot, and issues with rage for the entirety of the series. Of course, Stella's death just made him angrier.
</li><li> In the same show, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">Rau Le Creuset</a> may serve as a villainous example to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Gilbert Durandal</a>. Durandal's flashbacks show that he, in his capacity as Le Creuset's doctor and closest friend, was well aware of the latter's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalCosmicTemperTantrum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalCosmicTemperTantrum">suicidal</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist">nihilistic</a> tendencies, but was unable to do anything about them, ultimately leading to Le Creuset's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">descent into insanity</a> and eventual death while attempting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">trigger the apocalypse</a>. Durandal's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah">Dark Messiah</a> persona is based around ensuring that no one else ever has to suffer through the kind of pain, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues">identity problems</a>, and self-loathing that Rau did, leading him to try and create a world where no one will ever feel lost through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">any means necessary</a>. Le Creuset's ghost even visits the Chairman repeatedly, nicely driving home the point. A rare case of one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s death triggering the rise of another.
</li><li> Anew Returner for Lyle Dylandy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em>. Lyle goes into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> after.
</li><li> And lest we forget, Yurin L'Ciel for Flit Asuno from the latest series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamAGE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamAGE">Mobile Suit Gundam AGE</a>.</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Seeing Flit completely lose it</a> afterwards makes this depressing scene worse. Her death haunts him for the next <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>seventy years</em>, as he tries his hardest to slaughter all the Vagans he possibly can in revenge.</span>
</li><li> Four Murasame is the most prominent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em> for Kamille, although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">she wasn't the first or last death</a> that would drive him forward in this series.
</li><li> And, of course, the original that all others usually nod to, Lalah Sune in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>. She turns out to be an especially interesting case since she died saving Char by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">throwing herself in front of Amuro's beam saber strike</a>, leading to Char and Amuro blaming each other for her death for almost the rest of their lives.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Guyver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Guyver">Guyver</a></em> Chronos kidnaps Sho's father and turns him into a Zoanoid who rips out the Guyver's brain, causing Sho to go unconscious which leads the Guyver killing Sho's father on autopilot. Sho doesn't remember this, but he develops a psychological block against transforming. He doesn't find out about what he did until later on, where his angst lasts for about a minute before he takes care of business.
</li><li> Issei in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDXD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDXD">High School D×D</a></em> experienced this when Asia had "died" the second time, causing him to activate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade">Juggernaut Drive</a> and <em>eating</em> Shalba Beelzebub, the guy responsible, <em>alive</em>. He would have died too if it weren't for Vali's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> moment where it was revealed he and his group were able to get Asia out of the void dimension.
<ul><li> He also has an interesting example much earlier on. Interesting because the Gwen Stacy in question, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">Yuuma</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain">Raynare</a>, had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstEpisodeResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstEpisodeResurrection">already murdered him once</a>, killed above-mentioned Asia<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0oc4q');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0oc4q" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0oc4q');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This death resulting her her reincarnation as a devil, though he didn't know it at the time</span>, and mocked everything Issei had invested in their brief relationship. Issei snaps and punches her, only for her to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">revert to her Yuuma persona and plead for her life</a>. Issei couldn't bring himself to kill her, but left her to Rias' discretion, knowing Rias now had more reason to ever to see her dead. His deeply conflicted feelings over the whole affair left him with intimacy issues that haunt him for a long time after.
</li><li> Another example is with Baraqiel - Akeno's father, who blames himself for the death of his wife (by the hands of <em>her own family</em>, no less) and his daughter's subsequent estrangement and resentment. Issei, in Volume 7, manages to mend the ties between Akeno and Baraqiel by helping them defeat Loki.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Haku and Zabuza. While their deaths weren't directly caused by Naruto or Team 7 (although it's arguable that Kakashi caused the death of Haku), they forced the three to realize the suffering that came with being a ninja, and inspired Naruto to create his own way of the ninja - to never go back on his words.
</li><li> Kakashi has lived a life full of regrets because he blames himself for both of his teammates' deaths. Unfortunately, only Rin died. Obito didn't, and let's just say he didn't take Rin's death too well...
</li><li> During the Fourth Shinobi World War, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hiashi mentally apologizes to Hizashi for letting Neji die, even though it wasn't his fault as Neji willingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">took the bullet</a> to save Naruto and Hinata</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, Ace's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> caused Luffy to suffer a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">shutdown</a>, to the point he had to be carried off the battlefield by his allies. It's Ace's death that makes Luffy see that conviction and willpower alone isn't enough to become King of the Pirates, and that he's far too weak to go to the New World yet.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PsychoPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PsychoPass">Psycho-Pass</a></em> has Akane's friend, Yuki, whose throat got slashed by Makishima after she failed to shoot him. Her death changed Akane for the rest of her life which made her mature and more cynical about the Sibyl System.
<ul><li> Enforcer Teppei Sugo felt guilty for killing his own boss, Inspector Risa Aoyanagi, which he didn't know that at the time due to her having a very high crime coefficient and his line of firing is blocked by a wall. Ginoza understood that he's following protocol and then, told him not to speak to him again.
</li><li> Mika Shimotsuki blames herself for her friend and crush Kagami Kawarazaki's death since she told her to speak to Rikako Oryo about Yoshika Okubo's whereabouts as Oryo was seeing her before she disappeared. Unfortunately, Oryo was the killer behind the disappearances and murdered Kawarazaki when she went to speak to her alone. She explicitly tells Kunizuka it was her fault Kawarazaki died.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheSacredBlacksmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheSacredBlacksmith">The Sacred Blacksmith</a></em>, the eponymous Blacksmith, Luke, is burdened with guilt for directly or indirectly causing the death of his childhood friend Lisa (pronounced "Leeza", not "Leesa"...). Eventually, he finds out the awful truth: He's angsting himself unnecessarily. Lisa voluntarily risked herself to protect him from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Valbanill.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> makes quite some original use of this trope:
<ul><li> The Sailor Team (Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, and Venus) are unique in this aspect that they've actually literally died <em>twice</em> for Sailor Moon. The first time in the original series, Sailor Moon brings them back with the power of the Silver Crystal, but they lose their memories (only in the first anime). The second time, they actually die <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead">permanently</a></em> at the hands of Galaxia, but... It gets complicated from there.
</li><li> The manga adds a third and even worse death at the hands of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>Sailor Moon herself</em></span>, as Galaxia had revived them and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">brainwashed them into being her final bodyguards</a></span>. This one is also notable because it was a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">Invoked Trope</a>: Galaxia wanted to defeat Sailor Moon at her mightiest, so, when the first time she had killed them didn't completely work...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodenameSailorV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodenameSailorV">Codename: Sailor V</a></em>, the manga that <em>Sailor Moon</em> is a spin-off of, has arguably the worst of the all given to Sailor Venus: the one who dies is Ace, her true love, and he dies because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after reincarnating as a member of the Dark Kingdom he saw that Venus, who he loved from his past life, wasn't mentally up to the task so he, in a rather twisted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActOfTrueLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActOfTrueLove">Act of True Love</a>, set in motion events that led her to fall for him and then having to <em>kill him</em></span>. After that event, Sailor Venus became more serious (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarriedToTheJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarriedToTheJob">possibly too much</a>) and the leader the Sailor Senshi needed... But <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce">at the cost of serious mental issues</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">she refused to show</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Carrisford Radofrics in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrainStrategicArmoredInfantry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrainStrategicArmoredInfantry">Str.A.In.: Strategic Armored Infantry</a></em>, the death of whom disturbingly mirrors Sara's previous loss of her friends at Grabera.
</li><li> Willem from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SukaSuka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SukaSuka">Sukasuka</a></em> starts a romantic relationship with Fairy Soldier Chtholly, even proposing marriage to her, only for it to be cut short when she saves his life by sacrificing her own. His failure to protect her haunts Willem for the rest of the series.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em>, Kirito joins a guild of players, keeping the fact that he was a former beta tester and significantly higher in experience levels than his guildmates secret. This turns around to bite him in the ass when, while doing a dungeon run, he and his party get trapped in a room they can't warp away from. Kirito's level provokes the spawn of an entire horde of high-level monsters that, although Kirito was skilled enough to barely survive, they were way too much for his guildmates to handle. This causes the death of the entire guild (his party members dying in battle and the leader being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a>). Kirito's guilt over letting his guildmates die drives him into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualLoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualLoner">Ineffectual Loner</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Death Seeker</a> territory for months afterward.
</li><li> Simon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em> blames himself for the death of Kamina. He does get better by episode 11 but watching 3 episodes of depressed Simon is no fun at all. His return kicks all kinds of ass, though. Yoko also seems to feel a degree of this, but for different reasons.
</li><li> In Episode 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenrouSiriusTheJaeger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenrouSiriusTheJaeger">Tenrou Sirius the Jaeger</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> this is Yuliy feels after killing a scientist named Dr. Hanada, which results in the latter's daughter being traumatized.

It's all the more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tearjerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tearjerker">Tearjerker</a> when it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeclarationOfProtection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeclarationOfProtection">Aidou</a> who kills Fuuka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StakingTheLovedOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StakingTheLovedOne">at Fuuka's request</a>.
</li><li> The majority of Fushi's friends in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToYourEternity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToYourEternity">To Your Eternity</a></em> end up dying beyond his control whether it's from murder or natural causes. Either way, he felt guilty for not helping them enough and wanted to die at one point in time.
</li><li> Yoji of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WeissKreuz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WeissKreuz">Weiß Kreuz</a></em> is primarily motivated by the death of his partner and love interest Asuka.

After he snaps out of it, he carries on with the oath to never let it happen to his friends ever again.
</li><li> Subaru Sumeragi has his own Gwen Stacy in the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstySurvivingTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstySurvivingTwin">his twin sister Hokuto</a>, who dies at the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoBabylon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoBabylon">their own series</a> after Subaru falls into a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> of his own. Subaru actually helps Kamui out of his BSOD through their mutual experience.
</li><li> Kisara from the last arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> is a prime example. Seto's romantic interest, she sacrifices herself to protect him and gives him the power of the Blue-Eyes White Dragon. This is what finally motivates him to reject the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSide">Dark Side</a>.
</li><li> While not a death per se, Kolulu in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZatchBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZatchBell">Zatch Bell!</a></em> largely fits this trope since, within the scope of the series, getting your book burned is — for all intents and purposes — death. She provides the bulk of the motivation for the main character to strive on to become King of the demon world.

</li><li> In the alternate-future mini-series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderManReign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderManReign">Spider-Man: Reign</a></em>, Peter falls into a deep, long depression after accidentally causing the death of his wife Mary Jane. The depth and duration of his despair keeps him from putting on his costume again until her ghost (or something like a ghost) tells him that her final words to him ("go...") were actually cut short. She really meant to say, "Go get 'em tiger" one more time so he would know she was proud of him and didn't blame him for her death.
</li><li> In <em>Edge of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderVerse">Spider-Verse</a></em> #2, Gwen Stacy is bitten by a radioactive spider and becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGwen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGwen">Spider-Woman</a>, and Peter Parker dies on her watch in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByOriginStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByOriginStory">Death by Origin Story</a>. Peter decides to try to be more like her so she'll no longer have to protect him, but he ends up becoming the Lizard and going on a rampage. After Gwen subdues him, Peter dies in her arms after turning back to normal, as her toying with him during the fight allowed more time for the poisonous Lizard serum to fatally damage his organs. Gwen quickly becomes a fugitive who the general public believes killed an innocent teenage boy, and remains one for the majority of the Latour/Rodriguez/Renzi run of her solo series.

</li><li> This scenario was repeated in the early 10s with the fourth (post-New 52) Robin, Damian Wayne, who is Bruce's son with Talia al Ghul.

Realising he won't reach Gwen before she hits the floor, Peter fires a webline to Gwen and grabs hold of a pole to stop their falls, the sudden stop causing the webline to go taut and the resulting recoil caused Gwen's head to hit the ground. Peter's guilt and depression over not being able to save Gwen sees him quit being Spider-Man for 5 months.
<ul><li> Really this trope is Peter's guiding principle in general, probably to a higher degree than in other adaptations.

While successful, several aftershocks occur, forcing Superman to complete several daring rescues (e.g., saving a school bus from falling over the railings of a crumbling Golden Gate Bridge and a train from falling into a hole in the tracks). While Superman is kept busy with rescue after rescue, Lois Lane is caught in one of the aftershocks while driving on a little-used road. The car - which stalls after running out of gas - begins to fall into a large crack, and the car is caught in an avalanche of debris and dirt before Lois can escape; she is eventually suffocated.

<ul><li> Kyosuke had a good reason for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angst">Angst</a>. He <strong>had</strong> rescued Lamia, was holding her in the palm of the Alt's (his Mech) hand and was talking to her. Unfortunately, he had also let his guard down (something he often warned others against), and the shot that was fired was aimed at the hand that was holding Lamia, causing him to <em>throw</em> her away and out of the reach of the others. And according to Axel, if he did not interfere, he predicts that Kyosuke would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">fall into despair</a> out of this trope... and turns into another world-destroying maniac like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Beowulf</a>.

<ul><li> Notably, the original game initially seems averts this with the death of either Kaidan or Ashley on Virmire, as Shepard is the one who rationalizes to the survivor that a choice had to be made. The second and third games, however, show that it was not a death that Shepard ordered lightly, and they regret that there was no other choice.

In the former scenario, an assassin sent by Dimitri tries to kill Niko but, as Niko tries to wrestle the gun away, ends up shooting Niko's cousin Roman at his wedding instead. In the latter scenario, Niko's girlfriend Kate is gunned down at the same wedding when irate mob boss Jimmy Pegorino tries to off Niko in a drive-by. In both scenarios, Niko blames himself for allowing other people to get close to him, knowing the risks of his criminal lifestyle. The death then provides the motivation for the final mission in the game.

<ul><li> And a particularly good example, too. There's a possibility that if he'd been there during the attack, he could have re-enacted the Season One Finale with a hurricane or something. There's a <em>much</em> greater possibility that he'd have died as well, pretty much dooming the world. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoCoincidences" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoCoincidences">Running away was the right thing to do, even if he didn't know it at the time.</a>
</li><li> There's also another possibility that while he could have fended off the war, there would have been nothing he could have done to save his friends since the Avatar state is a defense mechanism, not something he can call upon (at the time) at will.
</li><li> Aang's situation kind of toys with it in numerous ways. For example, had he died, there would most certainly have been another Avatar born in time to repel the Earth kingdom invasion. This is why Sozin and Ozai needed him alive. But, there's no telling how his friends at the air temple may have taken it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation">The series could have wound up with a completely different</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> as any number of ripples could have expanded out from Aang's premature death defeating the Fire Nation armada.
</li><li> Sokka also goes through this. Since he was supposed to protect Yue, he blames himself for her death, even though she willingly sacrificed herself to save her tribe.
</li></ul></li><li> The Castle Wyvern clan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> are a villainous Gwen Stacy for Demona, who has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">meltdown</a> when she realizes that she is responsible for their deaths and actually becomes immortal just so she can live long enough to kill all of humanity.
<ul><li> Demona may be a subversion since she immediately backpedals and shifts ALL of the blame to humanity. The one time she admits culpability, it is under extreme duress (and hypnosis) and she backpedals again just as quickly.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck">Darkwing Duck</a></em> had Darkwing think that Gosalyn ran away during crime-fighting (She actually got caught up in Quackerjack's Time Traveling top and brought to the future). In the future, he became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> named Darkwarrior Duck and ruling St. Canard as a merciless dictator with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual">All Crimes Are Equal</a> policy.
</li><li> Ironically enough, this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparedByTheAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparedByTheAdaptation">averted with Gwen Stacy</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan">The Spectacular Spider Man</a></em>. The question of whether or not she would die was one of the most frequently asked of the fandom. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> stated after the series ended that they hadn't intended to kill her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries">Spider-Man: The Animated Series</a></em>, Mary Jane instead received the Gwen Stacyesque treatment, but through the less permanent method of being dropped into a portal. Spider-Man goes through similar emotional torment. The adaptation is taken even further: Mary Jane appears to return, and things proceed as normal and the two become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a>... and then MJ's revealed as a clone with the original's memories and dies in that two-parter and there is nothing Peter can do (clones don't live very long). The same thing that happened some years after Gwen's death in the comics: she returned, and was then revealed to be a clone made by the Jackal (meaning, the real Gwen was still dead and did not really return). During the final scene of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, Madame Web took him along so that they could find her, as a reward for saving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse">The Multiverse</a>; we don't see the actual reunion, but finding her is well within Madame Web's abilities.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> said that if they'd done another season, he'd have found her in Victorian England. He was satisfied with the conclusion though, so no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">Wangst</a> about that on his end.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em>, Rodimus Prime's tenure as the new leader of the Autobots is tinged with his regret and guilt over his unfortunate role in the death of the previous leader Optimus Prime.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em>, #21 blames himself for #24's death at the end of the third season. As a result, #21 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Took a Level in Badass</a>.
</li><li> Morph in the 1990s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen">X-Men</a></em> series, a character created just so he could die in the first episode and give the characters (mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>) a personal reason to fight. He came back later though, but as a bad guy, and it takes Wolvie a LOT to bring him back to the side of good...
<ul><li> This is especially evident at the beginning of season 2. Morph had 'died' in part because Wolverine was forcefully prevented from going back to help him after he was severely injured on a mission. When Wolverine discovers he's still alive, but in bad shape and on the run, he initially ignores the others (that think Morph should be left alone to sort things out for himself), and chases Morph all the way to the Amazon, rather than "abandon" him again. He eventually does let him go...but he and Cyclops, who gave the order to leave him behind (and Jean), immediately fly off to what appears to be Australia as soon as Morph calls them for help in the season finale.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens to Aquagirl in season 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>. Aqualad blames his friends for allowing her to die during a dangerous mission, and ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">betraying the team</a> and joining his father, Black Manta.
<ul><li> Subverted: As of the cliffhanger before the hiatus, it is revealed that Aqualad is acting as a double agent undercover in his father's organization. While this initially led to confusion on whether Aquagirl is really dead or not, Wally (who is in on the scheme) refers to her as someone Kaldur lost and a brief flashback to Aqualad and Nightwing forming the plan shows them shaking hands in front of Aquagirl's memorial. The video game <em>Young Justice: Legacy</em> confirms it in no uncertain terms— Tula's death is the climax of the plot.
