<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> had several people and countries do this.
<ul><li> Baroque Works occasionally pose as Alabastan troops attacking civilians in order to discredit the real army. Later, one agent actually transforms to look like the King of Alabasta to drive people into violent rebellion. Baroque Works agents were also placed among the rebels; agents on both sides are tasked with shooting key people on the other side if the Alabastan civil war appears to be reaching an end so that the war can continue. The organization's goal is to weaken both sides as much as possible so their leader, Crocodile, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivideAndConquer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivideAndConquer">can take over the country with minimal effort</a>.
</li><li> Don Krieg has also been known to use this strategy, specifically wanting to capture the <em>Baratie</em> to do it more easily.
</li><li> This was how the crooked and greedy king of Yvneel Kingdom screwed over Montblanc Noland after he "led" him on an apparent wild goose chase to what was supposed to be an island with a land of gold. He planted a fake member of Noland's crew from his servants and made him a "credible" source that Noland was a liar. In truth, the Knock-Up Stream blasted part of said island, Jaya, into the sky in between the time he left and returned. Too bad it was the part with the golden Shandora civilization.
</li><li> A big part of Fishman Island arc's flashback was that mermaid queen Otohime was apparently shot by a human. In the present, Fishman pirate Hody Jones, near the end of his takeover, gloats that it was <em>him</em> who shot Otohime, and framed a human pirate to instigate the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> between humans and fishmen.
</li><li> Doflamingo did this to King Riku when he took over Dressrosa. Claiming to Riku he'll leave the country be if Riku gets a large sum of money to pay him off. Since the people of the island trust the king, they willingly give it up. Only once they nearly had the money, Doflamingo used his string powers to take control of Riku and his soldiers and attack the kingdom, making it seem like he had gone mad until Doflamingo comes in and "stops the villainous king", gaining the people's favor and taking the throne.

As multiple other factions start colliding with each other, it ends up as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenSecret">Open Secret</a> as the "pirates" are usually aligned with Amerian forces in battle.

Naturally, she attacks the Aerialbots while the Stunticons make a hasty escape. This is a case of an inverted false flag operation, with one faction pretending to protect their enemies in the middle of a clear fight between the two groups in order to have their <em>mutual</em> enemies start blindly attacking.

His own ship, the <em>Indefatigable</em>, is attacked by 3 French corvettes before the <em>Papillon</em> can get away, and so Hornblower (having wound up in command by an unlikely series of events) orders the <em>Papillon</em> to engage the corvettes, taking advantage of the fact that the boarding party had yet to replace the Republican tricolor with the Blue Ensign (or rather the Ensign over the tricolor). He (and pretty much every RN officer) deems it a legitimate <em>ruse de guerre</em>. In the television adaptation, he instead claims ignorance of the rule when warned against this strategy by one of the more experienced sailors, sarcastically offering to let the sailor show him the rule <em>after</em> they save the <em>Indy</em>.

He has his henchmen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoBadGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoBadGuys">Victor and Tyrus</a> stage a shooting "attack" on Arturo's car, wounding Nacho and riddling Arturo's dead body with bullets, then blow up the car. This accomplishes several goals: it covers up the true cause of Arturo's death, obscures the fact that Nacho is now a double agent conscripted into working for Gus, and makes it look like Arturo's death and a truck robbery Mike had orchestrated on one of Hector's money couriers back in season 2 were the work of a rival gang wanting to take on the Salamancas. To complete the illusion, Gus has his men deliver some of the Salamanca's drugs to the Espinozas gang, and then has Nacho "identify" them to the Cousins, who subsequently massacre the Espinozas' compound.

Once the syndicate is taken down, Fisk has an inmate on his payroll named Jasper Evans shank him nonfatally and make it look like he's been branded as a snitch within the prison walls.

Takes a lot of guts and funding, but can truly work wonders.
<ul><li> This is also an option for <em>very</em> successful spy missions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MasterOfOrion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MasterOfOrion">Master of Orion</a></em>'.
<ul><li> Or just about any spy mission if you're the Darloks.

After a successful espionage/sabotage op, you can either leave no trace, or plant evidence incriminating another faction. It's a lot easier for the Cardassians and Romulans to do this than the Federation though.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Happens often in the <em>Suikoden</em> games.
<ul><li> There's the infamous Kalekka Incident, mentioned a few times in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenI">the first Suikoden</a>, in which Scarlet Moon soldiers slaughtered the entire town of civilians, while claiming it was actually Jowston soldiers that had done the horrible deed, in order to rouse support for the coming war among the anti-war citizens of the empire.
</li><li> Early on in <em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenII">Suikoden II</a></em>, the hero's army of about seven defend their castle from a major arm of the Highland Army, while the nebbishy Yamamoto slips between enemy platoons and plants false information. The immediate result of this false flagging Within one turn-of-play, THE ENTIRE ARMY outside of the main general's platoon- themselves- switch their flags before the player's eyes. The turncoats were actually conscripted soldiers that fought because they had no other choice, since the majority of the City-States have been taken over at that point. Only when they have a chance to win, basically, a hope, do they actually revert to their previous allegiance.
</li><li> Another example in the same game, is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the massacre of the Youth Brigade in the beginning. Prince Luca Blight, in order to justify starting a war with the enemy, betrays and slaughters his own Youth Brigade</span>, for the sake of propaganda.
</li><li> According to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a> of <em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenIV">Suikoden IV</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenTactics">Suikoden Tactics</a></em>, Scarlet Moon did this <em>before</em>, trying to spark a war with the Kooluk Empire. Unfortunately for them, they weren't aware that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a little boy in the town they attacked had the Rune of Punishment, which he used to destroy them all before the Rune ate his soul and jumped to another host. That boy also happened to be the son of one Graham Cray; the empire then blamed <em>him</em> for the incident, causing his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a>, defection to Kooluk and setting him up as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of IV</span>. So they had a history of pulling this sort of stunt, <em>and</em> having it blow up in their faces.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenV">Suikoden V</a></em>, the whole story behind Lordlake and the riots before the game started was that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Salum Barrows used the riot to incite more violence and storm the castle.

<ul><li> There are a couple of other examples from that game, too. Often, you end up having to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest">gather the flags yourself</a>. Also, a short example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a> III</em>: in the expansion Undead campaign, a couple of banshees <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">body-jack a group of guards</a> in order to get close to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Arthas</a>, who is in for some serious hurt from the banshees' leader. They pull it <em>again</em> against a different foe's mooks to get into a fortified city.
</li><li> Occurs again in <em>The Burning Crusade</em> during the Nagrand questline that puts you in service to Lantresor of the Blade. In order to stop the Boulderfist Ogres from attacking Telaar (Alliance) or to gain a powerful Ogre ally (Horde), the player needs to stop the two enemies of the Boulderfist Clan, the Laughing Skull Clan and the Warmaul Clan, from attacking. Obviously, Lantresor of the Blade suggests that you use flags and corpses to create the appearance of a battle between the two. It works.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShatteringPreludeToCataclysm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShatteringPreludeToCataclysm">The Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm</a></em>, some orc members of the Twilight Hammer cult attack a meeting of druids and kill all the night elves present while pretending that Garrosh ordered the massacre. Cairne is outraged at Garrosh's apparent responsibility for the attack, and challenges him to a duel for leadership of the Horde.
</li></ul></li><li> Sturm's plan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars">Advance Wars</a></em> was to incite a war between various countries with clones of their commanders so that he could sweep in when each faction was at its weakest and attack. He gets found out at the last minute by Sonja, who notices that Orange Star forces (led by Andy) were attacking Green Earth at the same time the real Andy was attacking Blue Moon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer">Command &amp; Conquer</a></em> occasionally does this with Nod campaigns. In <em>Tiberian Dawn</em> they steal GDI aircraft and bomb civillian targets to discredit GDI. In <em>Tiberian Sun</em>, the Brotherhood uses stolen GDI units against the mutant faction in order to win their trust. In the <em>Kane's Wrath</em> expansion to <em>Tiberium Wars</em>, Alexa Kovacs runs a <em>double</em> false flag - first she disguises her army as troops loyal to Kilian Qatar, then she has them assist GDI in attacking Temple Prime (thus framing Qatar as a GDI mole).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EndWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EndWar">EndWar</a></em>, a new World War erupts when the European Federation, leery of the United States achieving clear military dominance through completion of a militarized space station, fund terrorist attacks on them and when that fails, they use their anti-ballistic-missile <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat">Kill Sat</a> to shoot down the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxSymbolism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxSymbolism">Freedom IV</a> shuttle headed up to complete the station. <em>Actually,</em> the terrorists were funded by <em>Russia,</em> who was leery of being the world's largest supplier of oil once several other nations have hit Hubbert's Peak, and wanted the US to declare war on Europe so they could "aid their allies" in making Europe go away before the United States and Europe would turn Russia into Iraq II for their oil. As false flag operations go, this one is subverted; the plan goes off without a hitch... until the United States wigs right out when Russia starts making gains in the conflict and declares war on them, too.

It would have been hilarious, if it hadn't been for the dozens of injured protestors. Unfortunately, this also leads to people reflexively excusing bad behavior on the part of protesters by claiming that it was done by said agents, sometimes with the claim that real members wouldn't resort to violence.
</li><li> The Gleiwitz incident, when Nazi Germany provided justification for its war with Poland at the start of World War II by dressing some soldiers up in Polish uniforms, then attacking a German radio outpost while leaving behind a body, was just one of a number of independent operations collectively named "Operation Himmler". Noteworthy in that this was such an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Epic Fail</a> (absolutely no-one believed it), the fact that Germany claimed self-defense as a reason to go to war is regarded as an interesting bit of trivia instead of an important historical fact.
<ul><li> Later in 1939, the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelling_of_Mainila">Shelling of Mainila<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> started the Winter War between the Soviet Union and Finland. The event was semi-officially admitted as a false flag by the Soviet and Russian leaders from the 70s to the 90s, but under Vladimir Putin the Russian official stance has reverted to Stalin's version of events.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, there were some account(s) of people doing these to gain sympathy from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens">Apathetic Citizens</a>. These often involved exaggerating actions of the other side, accusing the other side of trying to do this to gain their sympathy, disguising as Germans or Russians and ransacking villages, or just spreading nasty rumors.
</li><li> Prior to America's entry into the WWII, German blockade runners often impersonated American merchant ships to sneak past the Royal Navy. This blew up in their face on November 6th, 1941, when the blockade runner <em>Odenwald</em>, ostensibly the freighter SS <em>Wilmotto</em> out of Philadelphia and hauling badly-needed rubber from Japan, ran into a Neutrality Patrol consisting of the light cruiser USS <em>Omaha</em> (CL-4) and the destroyer USS <em>Somers</em> (DD-381). When <em>Omaha</em> signaled the cargo ship to heave to for inspection, the Germans immediately scuttled and abandoned <em>Odenwald</em>. The boarding party sent from <em>Omaha</em> managed to save the ship, while <em>Somers</em> picked up the German crew (including one <em>Kriegsmarine</em> sailor from the battlecruiser <em>Graf Spee</em> who had escaped internment in Uruguay after the Battle of the River Plate, stowed away on a ship to Japan, and joined <em>Odenwald</em> at Yokohama to get home) and placed them in custody. It is often incorrectly cited as the last time the US Navy awarded a prize bounty for the capture of an enemy ship, but the United States was not yet at war, so the cash bonuses paid to the crews of both warships were in fact the legal salvage value of the ship and cargo.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2ykgk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2ykgk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2ykgk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">International law holds an abandoned merchant vessel, whether sunk or afloat, and her cargo to be the property of the salvors. The previous owners can buy everything back, or the salvage can be sold at auction, as the US Navy did with <em>Odenwald</em>. In this case, the largest payments went to the Sailors and Marines of <em>Omaha</em>'s boarding party, but every man aboard both ships got a piece (the Navy took a generous cut as well). They just had to wait for the Maritime Salvage Court to get around to processing the case, which didn't happen until 1946.</span>
</li><li> The Church of Scientology used stationery stolen from the apartment of author Paulette Cooper, who wrote an anti-Scientology book, to fake two bomb threat letters sent to Scientology facilities, and as part of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Freakout">Operation Freakout<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> were planning on faking some more bomb threat letters to send to (among others) the US Secretary of State at the time, Henry Kissinger.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/RushLimbaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/RushLimbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a>'s "Operation Chaos" during the 2008 Democratic primaries certainly tried its very hardest to be one of those. The idea was for Republicans to switch their party registration to Democrat and then vote for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryRodhamClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryRodhamClinton">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a> (the underdog, at that point) in the primaries, in an effort to draw the primaries out and encourage more intra-party warfare between Clinton and Obama supporters, with the end result of a divided Democratic Party, who would then lose to the Republicans in the general election. How well it succeeded in its initial goals is debatable — the primary fight went through all 50 states (an event not seen in American politics for close to 40 years prior), and False Flagging Republicans certainly had <em>some</em> effect, but it's hard to know precisely how much and where. How well it succeeded in the "split the Democrats down the middle and make McCain win" goal is a bit more obvious.
</li><li> In Naval Combat using a false flag is a <em>nom de guerre</em>, a "Name of War" and is a legal tactic <em>as long you hoist true colours prior to engaging</em>, even if it is mere seconds before. This is the origin of the idiom "to show one's true colours".
</li><li> Similarly, but less commonly, wearing the uniform of your enemy is also legal, as long as you discard the false uniform prior to engaging. Such a tactic was used in World War II, with the resulting post-war trials resulting in the tactic being recognised as legal to order, as long as the troops ordered to do so were reminded and advised that they would need to discard the uniforms or potentially be liable to be executed as unlawful combatants, spies or saboteurs.
</li><li> Britain used disguised ships to trap German commerce raiders during WWI. They sailed under neutral flags (often American) with the guns hidden, lured a commerce raider into challenging them, then hoisted the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_ensign">White Ensign<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and opened fire. Since the raider was 1) at close range and 2) probably surprised, this was an effective tactic. (Supposedly, at least one of these ships had special rigging to let it lower the decoy flag and raise the correct one simultaneously with a pull on a single rope.)
</li><li> In both great wars, armed merchantmen or auxiliary cruisers (the German term for retrofitted fast merchantmen) both operating under false flags from neutral or opposing nations. While the British primarily used these ships in a defensive role to sucker their opponents (as noted above), the German ships would be used against other merchant ships as commerce raiders and minelayers, seeding well-trafficked areas with mines, but particularly in the First World War, British AMCs were also used in a raider role against German ships that had escaped the blockade. Infamously, and demonstrating the confusion that can result from this practice, in the First World War, the armed merchantman RMS <em>Carmania</em> encountered the SMS <em>Cap Trafalgar</em>, disguised as the RMS <em>Carmania</em>. The former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfrontingYourImposter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfrontingYourImposter">immediately recognized</a> the deception and subsequently engaged and sank the <em>Cap Trafalgar</em> in the Battle of Trindade. Accounts of the battle are often embellished by claiming that RMS <em>Carmania</em> was also disguised as SMS <em>Cap Trafalgar</em>. This was not the case, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">it makes the story much funnier</a>.
<ul><li> <em>HMAS Sydney</em>, an Australian light cruiser was sunk as a result of this tactic being used by the German auxiliary cruiser <em>Kormoran</em> (converted from a civilian merchant ship) which had disguised itself as the Dutch freighter <em>Straat Malakka</em>. The use of the false flag, camouflage and signal trickery combined with slack handling by Sydney, saw the two ships enter very close range, at which point the surprise of the Kormoran allowed it to gain an upper hand on the heavy cruiser and pound it with torpedos and heavy gun fire. While Sydney was able to sink the Kormoran in retaliation, the majority of the German crew survived and were rescued, while the Sydney went down with all hands (the largest Allied ship to be lost with all hands) in a major blow to Australian morale.
</li></ul></li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a>, Confederate raiders disguised themselves as ships of foreign nations. CSS <em>Alabama</em>, a case in point, disguised itself as HMS <em>Spitfire</em>, a British warship, before the battle against USS <em>Kearsarge</em>. The only requirement, which all legitimate combatants followed, was that they identify themselves as warships of the correct nation before fighting (or, seizing a merchant ship.) It's still done today, in fact - there's a story floating around the interweb of the HMS <em>Illustrious</em> responding to radio challenges in Urdu when on exercises and pretending to be a cruise liner from Pakistan, thus fooling their opponents. This only works when outside visual range, but that isn't such a problem when you are an aircraft carrier.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note324ao');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note324ao" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note324ao');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It also only works if the opposing force in the exercise is unaware that while Urdu is one of the official languages of Pakistan, Pakistani merchant ships (like the government) operate using the <em>other</em> official language of Pakistan: English.</span>
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavon_affair">Lavon Affair<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: In 1954, Israeli agents in Egypt (mostly Egyptian Jews) planted bombs at British and American targets in Egypt, hoping it would be blamed on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist">the Muslim Brotherhood</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCommunists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCommunists">Communists</a>, or any number of nationalistic groups in the country. The Egyptian authorities found out about it, informing the Brits and Americans, neither of whom were amused. As for the Egyptians themselves, they considered it evidence that their Jewish population was all potential agents of Israel, and could potentially be a threat to security (this was probably wrong, but that didn't matter at the time), and so proceeded to <em>de facto</em> expel the Jews from Egypt (they weren't direct about it of course; mostly, the government let life get unbearable for them). To this day, the episode is often called "<em>haEsek haBish</em> (the Unfortunate Affair)" in Israel. The eponymous Pinhas Lavon, who OKed the plot, was forced to resign as Defense Minister as a result of the botched operation.
</li><li> Operation Northwoods, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> era program declassified in the 2000s, was a series of military proposals to commit false-flag operations and frame Cuba for it to justify an invasion, such as pretending to send a plane full of college students over the Gulf of Mexico, shooting it down, and blaming Castro; and planting false evidence of a Cuban attack should John Glenn be killed in his spaceflight. The scary thing? The plan was approved by all the Joint Chiefs of Staff and sent to the desk of the Secretary of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticallyMissingThePoint">Defense</a>. JFK however, was not at all amused when he found out, as General Lemnitzer, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, was forced to resign afterwards. Cue conspiracy theories galore in 1...2...3...
</li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a>, the ostensible idea behind NATO intelligence agenciess alleged <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_of_tension">Strategy of Tension<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> during <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gladio">Operation Gladio<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was to cow citizens into rallying behind the anti-communist, NATO-oriented governments of their respective states in Europe through exploiting their fear by backing several ultranationalist and neofascist terrorists and then attempting to pin <em>their</em> attacks, such as the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna_massacre">Bologna bombing<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, on leftist terrorists (<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Brigades">who<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> were <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_of_Lead_(Italy)">also active at that time<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>). The twist? The idea itself was a false flag; the entire so-called strategy of tension never existed. The alleged leaked documents outlining it were actually Soviet-made forgeries, designed to smear NATO and the US in particular. This hasnt stopped the proliferation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConspiracyTheories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConspiracyTheories">Conspiracy Theories</a> concerning the alleged use of the strategy, however.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukden_Incident">Mukden Incident<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> provided the pretext for the invasion of Manchuria by Japan.
</li><li> You know those ads for secrets "the credit card companies don't want you to know"? Most of those companies are <em>owned</em> by credit card companies. The logic being that if one goes bankrupt, they get nothing, but if they arrange even a partial payment, they get some kind of money.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsay_pamphlet_scandal">Lindsay Pamphlet Scandal<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: Prior to the 2007 Australian election, Liberal Party members were caught distributing pamphlets purportedly from a radical Muslim organisation (that did not actually exist) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourApprovalFillsMeWithShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourApprovalFillsMeWithShame">supporting</a> the Labor Party. They were immediately dismissed.
</li><li> Operation Trust, in which the Cheka (the first USSR state security service) ran fake counter-revolutionary groups so they could expose and arrest real Soviet counter-revolutionaries.
</li><li> In 1965, a clandestine group of army officers in Indonesia attempted, and failed, a coup against the military leadership. The army promptly blamed the whole incident on Indonesian communists...not the party, mind you, but <em>all Indonesian communists</em>, leading to the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_killings_of_1965">largest mass murder in Indonesian history<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to kill every last one of them (~500,000 or more). The operation was so successful the mass murder of communists and leftists is largely still unknown, ignored, or blamed on the actual communists who were among the first of hundreds of thousands killed.
</li><li> In 1975, Indonesia then tried to convince the international world that their invasion of East Timor was in fact an independent action by pro-Indonesia factions such as APODETI by giving their paratroopers Russian weapons, and... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">not much else</a>. If that's too hard for you to believe, consider the fact that during the invasion, Indonesian cargo planes accidentally dropped troops on the sea and the forces on the ground traded so much friendly fire that there might've been more Indonesian casualties from friendly fire than from the poorly-armed Fretilin resistance fighters.
</li><li> In 66 AD, a band of Jewish Zealots known as the <em>Sicarii</em> infiltrated the city of Jerusalem and proceeded to commit a series of atrocities against <em>their own people</em> in order to ensure that they would have no choice but to continue warring with the Romans rather than negotiate for peace.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Cannes_and_Nice_attacks">Hostels in southern France inhabited mainly by Muslim immigrants were bombed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in 1988; notes were left at the scene of one of the bombings with the perpetrators describing themselves as the Zionist "Masada Action and Defense Movement". Once French police tracked and caught the perpetrators, they found them to be neo-Nazis <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsYouAndHimFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsYouAndHimFight">who were trying to stir up tensions between Muslims and Jews</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_Rex_fire">Cinema Rex fire<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in Iran, which was a major prelude to the Iranian Revolution. This one was particularly notable for actually being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> (and something of a double subversion) pulled off by the revolutionaries. The cinema at the time was widely seen a symbol of Western intrusions into Iran's traditional society and was a frequent target of criticism by Islamists. The revolutionaries who burned down the cinema knew that the Iranian government was well aware of their hatred of the institution and correctly predicted that Shah would immediately jump to blame them for the attack. This then allowed the revolutionaries to counter-accuse the government of making a baseless accusation against them without any evidence and, in turn, claimed that the fire was a false-flag committed by the secret police SAVAK. As much of the public was already sympathizing with the revolutionaries at this point and since SAVAK itself was already known for being a not-so-benevolent force that had executed false-flag operations in the past, the event was a huge PR victory for the Islamists and became a lightning rod that pushed the country into further chaos.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist%C2%96Leninist_Party_of_the_Netherlands">Marxist-Leninist Party of the Netherlands<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a fake pro-China communist party in the Netherlands set up by the Dutch secret service to develop contacts with the Chinese government for espionage purposes.
</li><li> In the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Meadows_massacre">Mountain Meadows Massacre<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a Mormon militia disguised themselves as local Ute braves, attacking and massacring emigrants moving through the area. While the massacre was intended to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveNoWitnesses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveNoWitnesses">Leave No Witnesses</a>, this failed because one of the participants later confessed to his crimes and identified the ringleaders.
</li><li> There have also been a lot of documented agent provocateur activities, both recently and a while back. In 1977, CBS News obtained a US Army document that detailing plans for dealing with protesters at the 1968 DNC. According to the document, about one out of 6 people at the protests was an FBI operative or some other type of government asset.
</li><li> In June 1968, during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BrazilianMilitaryRegime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BrazilianMilitaryRegime">Brazilian Military Regime</a>, several officers of an air force rescue unit planned to blow a bank, a department store, an American embassy, a gas holder and a dam with remote explosives. One of the objectives was to blame left-wing guerrillas. One officer denounced the attack, and the Government was less than pleased with the news.
<ul><li> Later, in April 1981, two Brazilian officers tried to bomb a music concert and blame a group called the "People's Revolutionary Vanguard" (inactive since 1972). The bomb exploded earlier than planned, killing one of the men and injuring the other.
</li></ul></li><li> The whole goal of the murders committed by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesManson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesManson">Manson Family</a> were intended to start a race war between the black and white people of the country. Their idea of how to plant "convincing" evidence that the murders of wealthy white victims had been done by black militants included writing in blood on the walls and making a small paw print, referring to the Black Panthers (there are some reports they also left watermelon rinds in the sink but it is hard to verify, so it might be a rumor). Manson and his gang were arrested, tried and convicted, their clumsy attempt at a false flag horrifying many, but fooling nobody.
</li><li> A rather silly example: a Tennessee high school football coach <a class="urllink" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/14/football-coach-vandalizes_n_4275209.html">was fired and arrested after vandalizing his own school<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and spray-painting insults about his own players, in the hopes that a rival school would be blamed and his team would be riled up for the upcoming game.
</li><li> While it's never been proven, there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConspiracyTheories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConspiracyTheories">theory</a> that many of the supposedly "Soviet" submarine incursions into Swedish territorial waters during the 1980's were actually done by US and British submarines. These happened after the so-called "Whisky in the Rocks" incident where an actual Soviet submarine was grounded in Swedish waters, the theory stating that NATO wanted to create the illusion that the Soviets were continuing to disrespect Swedish neutrality. While the theory has never been proven, former US Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger has gone on record that US did regularly enter Swedish waters during that time.
</li><li> It has been widely alleged, with evidence, that the Ukrainian separatists/insurgents/fighters-against-the-government, starting in 2014, have basically been the Russian Army with some upset locals mixed in. Numerous incidents have occurred where Russian soldiers have been found mixed among Donetsk fighters, including an <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28934213">infamous incident where Russian soldiers were discovered in Donetsk, claiming to have 'gotten lost'.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> If it is a false flag operation, it is almost as much of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Epic Fail</a> as the Gleiwitz incident noted above. The Russian government has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlausibleDeniability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlausibleDeniability">Plausible Deniability</a>, though, as all those soldiers are listed as being "on vacation" with all the paperwork properly filled out and signed.
</li><li> In 1956, incensed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GamalAbdelNasser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GamalAbdelNasser">Nasser</a> had nationalized the Suez Canal, the British government conspired with France to encourage Israel to start a war with Egypt. The goal of the operation was for Britain and France to step in as peacekeepers, and to make sure that hostilities did not spill over from the Sinai Peninsula once that conflict ended, Britain and France would occupy and control the canal. This backfired spectacularly. Israel made it to the edge of the Sinai Peninsula, but was forced to withdraw. Alexandria was occupied, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.</a> forced Britain and France to admit that they had violated Egypt's right as a sovereign nation to take control of the canal, and forced them to withdraw their forces from the territory they captured. In Britain, Prime Minister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AnthonyEden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AnthonyEden">Anthony Eden</a> was forced to resign, in no small part because U.S. President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower">Eisenhower</a> warned that the U.S. will in no way support Britain's endeavor in Suez, and warned that the U.S. would decrease military aid.
</li><li> A common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">internet trolling</a> tactic is to find some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar">Flame War</a> in progress and pose as a member one or both sides of the debate and making ever inflammatory comments toward to other side. This will ensure that the flame war stays hot and both sides don't make even the slightest progress towards reconciliation. Some of the more ambitious trolls will post in the community their identity is in but its often simply as easy as creating an account.
</li><li> This is the whole deal behind swatting (falsifying an emergency to trick a swat team into storming someone's home, typically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">just for fun</a>). People have been hurt for real and almost died due to this. Fortunately new laws have been (and continue to be made) to punish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">scum</a> who engage in this sort of thing, including making them responsible for any property damage caused as a result.
