They may be using irregular military tactics, but they will probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StillWearingTheOldColors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StillWearingTheOldColors">still be dressed in their old uniforms</a> (or the remnants thereof). Unlike a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">General Ripper</a>, The Remnant no longer hold an official position in the armed forces, often because their government has ceased to exist or has been replaced. In a number of cases, this happens because <em>nobody on either side has yet been informed that the war is over.</em> The losing side then becomes The Remnant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners">by default after the fact</a>.

(And restoring peace to a population accustomed to war and violence is going to be tricky, too.)
</p><p>A Remnant using guerilla warfare can be much more dangerous than they were as an established government; guerillas are constantly on the move, and have the luxury of choosing which target they'll attack next. The standard advice is that you need ten soldiers for every guerilla to defeat an insurgency, which means a lot of money and sustained effort, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.ausa.org/publications/anatomy-failed-occupation-us-army-former-confederate-states-1865-1877">which means that an occupying army will sometimes just give up.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

The group was lead by someone who was only known as "The Life Maker" and "The Mage of the Beginning". They fueled a war in order to accomplish this. It was the war and the defeat of The Mage Of The Beginning that made Nagi Springfield (Protagonist's father) a legend.

The single largest one fled to the asteroid base Axis and became the first Neo Zeon movement in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Zeta Gundam</a></em>; the others include the Delaz Fleet, Cima's marines, and the Kimbareid force (all in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0083StardustMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0083StardustMemory">Gundam 0083</a></em>), as well as Rommel's force (in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ">Gundam ZZ</a></em>).
<ul><li> The furthest extension of this appears in <em>Gundam F90</em>, centering on Zeon remnants who've been hiding on Mars for nearly fifty years before making their move.

It gets its <em>own</em> remnant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn">Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn</a></em>, in the form of the Sleeves, led by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharClone">Char Clone</a> Full Frontal.

They're not exclusively military either, as many of their Earth camps include numerous civilians.

</li><li> Rare heroic example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix">Asterix</a></em>. Gaul has surrendered to the Romans, but one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndefeatableLittleVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndefeatableLittleVillage">Undefeatable Little Village</a> still lives like it's the Iron Age and holds out against the invaders! ...or not, as they never engage in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a>-type action, preferring mostly to get on with their own, usually quite petty lives, and beat up any Romans trying to tell them what to do rather than attempting to liberate Gaul. The story clearly establishes that legally, the village is Roman, and the characters even exploit this when being part of the Roman Empire would be helpful to them. They also adopt Roman technology, such as the use of sestertii as currency, wax tablets, Roman numerals and writing, and so on, and everyone's bilingual Gaulish and Latin, though some are better at Latin than others. Caesar even says that the Roman government pays a peace settlement to their chief, as agreed upon in the terms of surrender, and the chief's wife is angry that the Romans haven't made him a senator. And yet, they proudly refuse all Roman identity, did <em>something</em> to the Roman taxman so he would never come back there again, and any Romans approaching the village get beaten to a paste. They have no interest in being seriously liberated and are well aware the war is over, but continue fighting it because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">it's fun</a>, they hate the Romans on principle, and they just don't care.
<ul><li> <em>Obelix All At Sea</em> and <em>The Secret Weapon</em> suggest Asterix's goal is for the Romans to grant them peace with honours, but if they tried to negotiate surrender as it is all the warriors would end up in prison, so fighting until the Romans get the message is the only option. Obelix is horrified by any suggestion of compromise and considers it trampling on the memory of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalDomainCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalDomainCharacter">Vercingetorix</a>, with the implication that most of the other villagers agree with this.

</li><li> A central trope in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sandokan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sandokan">Sandokan</a></em> series:
<ul><li> The title character is the legitimate Rajah of Lake Kini Balu, who lost his throne, his father and entire family due a British-supported rebellion. After barely surviving he assembled a pirate crew and brought it to Mompracem, quickly becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishEmpire">The British Empire</a>'s chief annoyance due his success in raiding their trade and the increasing power of the Tigers of Mompracem.
</li><li> The Tigers of Mompracem become their own remnant <em>twice</em>: first near the end of the first novel <em>The Tigers of Mompracem</em>, when the British and other European states with holdings in the Indian Ocean, having decided the Tigers were becoming an actual threat, launched a joint expedition that decimated the pirates and chased them off their island; after Sandokan returned to Mompracem with a new and stronger crew off-page he eventually abandoned piracy, but halfway during <em>The King of the Sea</em> they're once again attacked by the British (manipulated by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Suyodhana's son</span>) and chased off Mompracem, though this time they're in the state to fight back with the title ship (the mightiest warship in the world, that they aquired too late to defend Mompracem) and spend most of the novel attacking British trade. By <em>Sandokan Fights Back</em> they have retaken Sandokan's ancestral homeland, and after the British sell it to the Sultan of Varauni they retake Mompracem in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Return to Mompracem</a></em>.
</li><li> In <em>The Pirates of Malaysia</em>, having entered in conflict with James Brooke the Rajah of Sarawak, join forces with the nephew of his dispossessed predecessor Muda Hashim to depose the White Rajah. Brooke also left behind a remnant, who by the time of <em>The King of the Sea</em> has put his nephew Charles (Brooke's actual successor in real life) back on the throne.
</li><li> After the destruction of the Thuggee cult at Sandokan and Tremal Naik's hands in <em>The Two Tigers</em>, a handful of survivors, armed with their immense treasure and led by the son of their defunct leader Suyodhana, acts to take their revenge on the Tigers. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They're the ones who bribe and threaten enough British officials to have them launch the attack on Mompracem in <em>The King of the Sea</em>, and show up in person with a flotilla of warships crewed mostly by mercenaries at the end of the novel, defeating Sandokan... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems">Only for Suyodhana's son to disband the group due falling in love with Tremal Naik's daughter</a></span>.

Some of Sindhia's followers survived, helping the White Rajah of Lake Kini Balu in <em>Sandokan Fights Back</em> (and proving far more effective than the now senile White Rajah) and attacking directly Surama in <em>The Brahman</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekDeepSpaceNineRelaunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekDeepSpaceNineRelaunch">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Relaunch</a>, a small fleet of Jem'Hadar warships, led by Kitana'klan, continue to wage war on the Dominion's rivals for several months after the peace treaty is signed. Ashamed of their species' failure to take the Alpha Quadrant, they're determined to renew the fighting even against the will of the Founders. Three months after the conflict's conclusion, they attack Deep Space Nine, destroying the starship <em>Aldebaran</em> with all hands and damaging the starship <em>Defiant</em>. They are in turn attacked by the loyal Jem'Hadar Taran'atar, who was en route to Deep Space Nine as an envoy on the orders of Odo. He defends the station with his own warship, and eventually foils a secondary plot by Kitana'klan to destroy the reactor core.
<ul><li> In the pre-relaunch series of books, <em>Station Rage</em> involves Sisko and Odo stumbling upon a hidden room on Deep Space Nine containing the last surviving members of the Crescent Order, an old Cardassian military unit left over from a war that ended eighty years earlier. After Garack revives them from stasis, the holdovers mistakenly believe that "Terok Nor" has been occupied by a hostile force, and set about trying to force Sisko and his crew out.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a> novels set in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Legends</a></em> continuity, the Empire (referred to as the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">Imperial Remnant</a>") continues to be the major antagonist despite the Emperor himself dying in the Battle of Endor. (When people wonder why in various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> stories, it's pointed out that if the entire ruling council of the New Republic was killed in an attack...they'd be replaced by people who probably wouldn't be as good at the job; hardly a crushing blow.) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HandOfThrawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HandOfThrawn">Fifteen years later</a>, they are reduced to less than a hundredth of their former strength, and there are <em>still</em> politicians and commanders who refuse to give up—even though the Supreme Commander notes that the average Imperial citizen probably realized it years ago, and decides on his own to arrange for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeaceConference" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeaceConference">Peace Conferences</a> with the New Republic so that the Empire could survive to rise again, one day.
<ul><li> That day came <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StarWarsLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StarWarsLegacy">many years later</a>, long after the Vong Invasion. At some point the Empire reformed and the Republic became The Remnant, and as the entire galaxy had become rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">darker</a> by that point, that Empire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGreyMorality">doesn't come off as too evil</a>.
<ul><li> Of course, by this time the Empire has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">softened considerably</a> from the days of Vader and Sidious — the Emperor is very strongly hinted to be a descendant of Han Solo and Leia (through their daughter, Jaina — admittedly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheForce">being called Solo isn't an anti-dark side guarantee</a>); the anti-alien doctrine is gone to the point where you have Devaronian stormtroopers and Kel Dor admirals; and the new version of the Royal Guards are basically Jedi whose first rule is that if the Emperor goes to the dark side, they kill his ass (the official word from the Jedi Order proper is that the Emperor and his guards are neither dark nor light side). Then, of course, the Sith perform a coup and this Empire becomes a <em>second</em> Remnant, locked in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar">Enemy Civil War</a> with a Sith-run Empire where it's pretty much back to the old business of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh">maniacal cackling</a> and sneering at opponents. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> is still (mostly) gone though.
</li></ul></li><li> Another example would be the scattered remnants of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Officially known as Separatist Holdouts, the ones which weren't destroyed by the Galactic Empire were absorbed into the Rebel Alliance.
</li><li> In a much smaller example, there were two separate soldiers who crashed on two different essentially uninhabited jungle planets and didn't hear that their war was over for some twenty years. The first, apparently based on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> Japanese soldiers, was a TIE pilot on Yavin IV who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungJediKnights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungJediKnights">found by the Solo twins</a>, antagonized them, eventually helped them, and went back to living alone in the jungle, then aided them again against the Vong. The second, chronologically the first, was <a class="urllink" href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Able">Able 1707<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a clone trooper whose troop transport crashed. The other troopers died — most clone troopers age at twice the normal rate — leaving him to wait until Imperial and Rebel forces skirmished near him, when he had to try and figure out which side was his. He eventually ended up as a rather Badass and slightly antiheroic commando for the Rebellion, only to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">transformed into a rakghoul monster</a>. Sigh.
<ul><li> Oddly enough, while individuals like Qorl (that'd be the aforesaid TIE pilot) happen quite often, the <em>Imperial</em> Remnant is never <em>The</em> Remnant — they remain a full-function government, albeit with less territory every year.
</li><li> It is also worth noting that, depending on the time period, it is not always a united <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">Vestigial Empire</a> as much as a series of rival factions. During his life, the Emperor deliberately tore down the bureaucracy of the Old Republic, replacing it with something akin to a feudal system, with regional governors having direct control over their territories, all of whom were loyal to him, with the military might of the Empire to enforce it. When the Emperor was killed, those factions had no supreme leader holding their allegiance anymore, and many different regional governors had different ideas about succession and policy. After Thrawn's and the reborn Emperor's deaths, the Empire disintegrated as a unified force and spent the next decade or so in an off-and-on state of civil war, with former governors and high military officers setting themselves up as despots. This lasted until Admiral Daala resurfaced and brought together most of these leaders to hash out an Imperial alliance that could strike back at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">the Rebellion</a>. This failed, and she simply had them all killed and took over the whole shebang pretty much by default. When her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure">latest master plan failed</a>, she turned over leadership to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Admiral Pallaeon</a>, who ruled the still-unified Empire in a kind of military junta with a group of civilian Moffs as an advisory council, a situation that carried all the way through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NewJediOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NewJediOrder">Vong wars</a> and most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheForce">new Galactic Civil War</a>.
</li><li> Daala herself, when introduced, could be seen as another analog to Japanese soldiers found years after WWII who didn't know the war was over. The Maw Installation that Daala was in charge of was almost completely cut off from the rest of the galaxy by a series of black holes, so as such, they didn't even know about Palpatine's death, let alone the formation of the New Republic and disintegration of the Empire. It was only when the heroes of the Rebellion stumbled upon her that she found out, leading to her emergence and the events listed above.

Since JWA was a men company, The All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling Club was the cornerstone of an association set up to oversee multiple women's pro wrestling companies after the WWWA stopped by on their world tour and proved women wrestlers could draw.

All the sides are technically at peace, but one of the main aspects of the setting is that the peace is so fragile that any kind of major incident (which the player characters will no doubt get involved in) could start another war.

The Netheril Empire pretty much collapsed entirely in the event known as Karsus' Folly, which destroyed all their major cities. Thultanthar survived by being thrown into the Shadowfell, where it remained for millennia, until events preceding the cataclysmic Spellplague shifted it back. Being an Empire, they went to work rebuilding in the most imperialist fashion. The enclave was destroyed permanently by Elminister during the Second Sundering.

</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue">Playable Epilogue</a> to four of six plotlines in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeVelocity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeVelocity">EV Nova</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">the Bureau</a> is ousted from their control of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">the Federation</a> and its lawfully elected government is restored to power. But you periodically run across Bureau remnant forces flying their trademark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship">RAGE Gunboats</a>, battling Federation Navy ships.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> series has plenty, since it takes place <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a>.
<ul><li> The series' recurring villainous faction is the Enclave, éminence grise members of the pre-war U.S. government who rode out the apocalypse in their bunker before emerging to retake the wasteland. Responsible for unscrupulous projects such as the Forced Evolutionary Virus and Vault Experiment, over the course of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em> they try to kill everyone that doesn't match their criteria of "pure" human, which considering all the radiation is pretty much everybody except themselves and Vault Dwellers who have never left their vaults. They get defeated. So when you encounter them in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>, you're fighting the remnant of The Remnant, and then in the <em>Broken Steel</em> expansion you fight the remnants of <em>that</em>. As of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> the Enclave is all but extinct, but you can convince a handful of survivors to rally for one last hurrah at the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, where they'll become the stuff of legends. That said, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">the game hints that there are probably more Enclave holdouts in the Midwest, such as the Chicago outpost visited by ED-E.</a>
</li><li> Many members of The Master's super mutant army survived his death, and by the time of <em>Fallout 2</em> eighty years later, the smarter ones have settled in peace in the city of Broken Hills. While super mutants can be encountered as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">particularly dangerous</a> raiders, <em>New Vegas</em> reveals that most are happy to readjust to a peaceful life. Unfortunately, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Nightkin</a> have had their sanity shattered due to use of their stealth technology, and still wage war on non-mutants for various crazy reasons, even as their non-nightkin brethren are working to cure them of their afflictions.
</li><li> The Brotherhood of Steel technically qualifies, as they're descended from a group of former United States Army soldiers. In a twist, it's revealed in the first game that the soldiers were <em>mutineers</em> and the Brotherhood was effectively a secessionist movement. Unlike most examples on this page, they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGreyMorality">relatively</a> heroic, if rather racist and exclusionist.
<ul><li> The Brotherhood of Steel itself seems to be heading this way after the events of <em>New Vegas</em> and <em>Fallout 4</em>, potentially much more so if the players don't like the Brotherhood. First <em>New Vegas</em> canonized the NCR-Brotherhood war, which either eradicated most West Coast chapters or drove them into hiding like the Mojave chapter. The tone of Elder Maxison's terminal entries make it sound as if the East Coast chapter of the Brotherhood is by far the most active chapter and that the Brotherhood as a whole depends on them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Fallout 3</em> features the Chinese Remnant, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhoulsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhoulsAreDifferent">ghoulified</a> pre-War Chinese infiltrators lurking in the ruins of Washington D.C.
</li><li> The <em>Point Lookout</em> DLC also has Desmond Lockheart and Professor Calvert, two high-ranking pre-War intelligence officers who have carried on their old rivalry for two hundred years, even though the nations they once represented no longer exist. And it's implied that there are others like them still playing the "Great Game."

By that point in the game, nearly all of the founding members are dead, with only one of the two Reed brothers left to carry the name of the Fang.

<ul><li> In the first game, is a Vasudan group calling themselves "The Hammer of Light" who refuse to accept their government's cease-fire with the Galactic Terran Alliance, and believe that the genocidal Shivans are a prophesized god-race. The Vasudan Empire declares them a terrorist group and they are believed to have been wiped out some time after the formation of the Galactic Terran-Vasudan Alliance.
</li><li> In the second game, the Terran Admiral Bosch forms a Polaris-based militant group called the Neo-Terran Front. Their aims are to overthrow the current Terran government and break ties with the now-friendly Vasudans, motivated mainly by good old-fashioned racism (speciesism in this case). They are declared a rebel group and wiped out over the course of the game. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It was actually all a front by Bosch, who really wanted an excuse to plunder some Vasudan ruins and revive an abandoned Terran project to communicate with the Shivans. He is successful in this endeavor, and survives the game... albeit in the custody of the Shivans, and who knows what they intend to do with him.</span>

His father, King Adelbern, refuses to surrender his homeland and continues fighting against the Charr as did the Ebon Vanguard to the far north. Between games Adelbern's war ended with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">Last Stand</a> in Ascalon City where he invoked the Foefire, killing the remaining Ascalonians and binding them as ghosts to continue fighting.

</li><li> The White Mantle ruled over Kryta for a few years before they and their Mursaat masters were defeated and driven out. Centuries later the cult lingers in secret, stirring up political dissent and funding bandits to harass the Krytan rulers they view as usurpers.
</li><li> Ebonhawk was the last bastion of Ascalonians against the Charr conquest of their nation. This ended when the threat of the Elder Dragons forced the races to unite. The people of Ebonhawk are bitter about this betrayal with many forming the Separatists, a band of outlaws intent on sowing discord between Charr and human.

In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld">Homeworld</a></em>, exiles literally march to the heart of their very empire.

In the time of the expansion, the Imperial capital is controlled by the exiles, and the rebellion is establishing a new government. However, this fails to stop several Taiidan warlords and splinter factions from trying to attack the still vulnerable ex-capital and try to establish the empire again. By the time of the full sequel, whats left of the Taiidani joins the Vaygr in trying to destroy Hiigara.

Canada (now the home of the exiled British monarchy), large parts of the Caribbean, Australia and New Zealand (now united as the Australasian Confederation), and a democratizing rump of British India continue to identify as parts of the empire, but in reality they are a coalition of independent states.
</li><li> The remnants of the Third French Republics military managed to hold on to much of Northern Africa after socialist revolutionaries seized mainland France, forming the second major arm of the Entente.
</li><li> Lastly, theres the Kingdom of Sardinia, the last territory ruled by the House of Savoy, the former reigning dynasty of the now-dead Kingdom of Italy.
</li></ul></li><li> If Germany is overrun during the Second Weltkrieg, but still holds its African colonies, the German monarchy and government can flee to them and attempt to keep fighting. The Netherlands can do the same if they still hold Indonesia.
</li><li> Several examples in China:
<ul><li> After Chiang Kai-sheks defeat in the Northern Expedition, the Kuomintang has been scattered, but remnants of their forces survive in Yunnan and Fujian provinces, waiting for their chance to rise up again.
</li><li> After the German-backed restoration of the Qing dynasty in Beijing, the Fengtian clique in Manchuria is now the last remnant of the Xinhai republic.
</li><li> During the course of the game, if one of Chinas major factions is defeated, but has allies in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard">Sichuan Clique</a>, they can retreat there and form a last redoubt.

But the sequel keeps the camera running. Ganon's warriors have regrouped and summoned up new allies, and now they're harrying the countryside and making reconstruction impossible. They have two objectives: to keep Hyrule weak enough that it can be reconquered easily, and to draw out Link so they can sacrifice him and get their master back. It doesn't work in the actual story (Link was just that good), but Ganon's return is the Game Over screen, so you'll be seeing it happen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">a time or two</a>.

Sergei's top guy, Ocelot, hints that certain corners of the Russian armed forces are disgusted with the current state of their country. The Colonel himself has a personal motive: After the USSR collapsed, his hometown was bought up by the U.S. and turned into an atomic testing site.

It even goes so far as to have the solution be an analogue to bringing in the old commanding officer (the Federation brings out the Female Changeling imprisoned after the war, and gets her to co-operate by offering to return her to the Dominion for her assistance). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> That is to say, the <em>intended</em> solution.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">Genrikh Yagoda</a> has relocated the remnants of the Soviet government to the Siberian city of Irkutsk, but controls only the surrounding area, with the rest of Russia crumbling into warlordism:
<ul><li> The West Russian Revolutionary Front was formed by surviving Red Army divisions west of the Urals. It saw some success, briefly re-starting the war with Germany and nearly seizing Moscow. However, their offensive ran out of steam, and the Front became a remnant of <em>itself</em>, holed up near Arkhangelsk and only surviving because the Germans were too exhausted to keep pursuing them.
</li><li> East of the Urals, theres also the Central Siberian Republic, a democratic state founded by prominent Soviet intellectuals with dissident sympathies. It saw some brief success, but also collapsed when its own generals (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">being former Red Army officers with no loyalty to democratic institutions</a>) mutinied at the first sign of trouble. It now only controls the minor city of Tomsk.
</li></ul></li><li> The Chinese Right-KMT and the Chinese Communist Party were nearly annihilated after the Japanese sacked Chongqing. However, some warlords in the mountains loyal to the Right-KMT were never fully defeated, and theres still some scattered bands of communist guerrillas in Shanxi.
</li><li> The very last Free French garrison continues to cling to the Ivory Coast.
</li><li> Whenever one of Nazi Germanys <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FascistButInefficient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FascistButInefficient">far-flung, poorly managed, guerrilla-laden</a> colonies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">inevitably collapses</a>, theres often a faction (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar">or two</a>) representing the stranded German settlers and garrison personnel.

</li><li> Abundant in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em> universe — enemies are never fully killed off, they periodically return after slowly rebuilding.

<ul><li> The early missions of <em>Warcraft III</em> feature orcish holdouts from the Second War, clinging to "dying traditions" and using armies evocative of <em>Warcraft II</em>. Later expansions, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, turn the tables by featuring a xenophobic Alliance admiral campaigning against the (reformed) orcs even after a truce between the Alliance and the Horde.
</li><li> The upper reaches of Blackrock Mountain are ruled by the remnants of the "Dark Horde," the few ogre, troll, and orc clans that fell under the rule of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonTheirFeet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonTheirFeet">Rend Blackhand</a> decades ago, and who feel that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftII">Second War</a> has never really ended. What makes this self-proclaimed "true Horde" dangerous is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeterminedDefeatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeterminedDefeatist">they know their ongoing battle is largely hopeless, but they keep fighting anyway</a>.
</li><li> Meanwhile in Outland is the "Fel Horde," demon-corrupted orcs left behind following the destruction of the Dark Portal. They've since thrown their lot with Illidan after he conquered Outland from the Burning Legion.
</li><li> The trollish tribes such as the Amani or Gurubashi are actually the remnants of ancient, mighty empires. Thousands of years later, their capitals are mostly ruins, and their (cannibalistic) culture and technology are primitive compared to the rest of the world. As of the "Rise of the Zandalari" patch, these remnants have united under the Zandalar tribe, the oldest troll civilization, in a last-ditch effort to reverse their race's decline and build a civilization capable of surviving their island home's destruction.
</li><li> When Arthas rolled into Quel'thalas at the head of the Scourge forces during the events of <em>III</em>, 90% of the High Elf race was slaughtered. The survivors, few in number and cut off from the Sunwell, took to naming themselves Blood Elves in remembrance of their fallen. The Scourge not only devastated their population but their cities and their culture as well; Blood Elves use different magic (fire rather than frost or water, and more Blood Elves are becoming warlocks, something inconceivable to many High Elves), and they dress differently. Taking this further, the Blood Elves have thrown their lot in with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorde">The Horde</a>, and the scant handfuls of High Elves who still cling to the old culture and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance">The Alliance</a> view them as race traitors.
</li><li> After Arthas' death at the end of <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em>, Bolvar Fordragon becomes the new Lich King in order to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">keep the Scourge in check</a>. However in the subsequent <em>Cataclysm</em> expansion it's revealed that Darkmaster Gandling took advantage of the new Lich King's weakness to take control of the Scourge forces in the Plaguelands.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Scarlet</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters">Crusade</a> see themselves as righteous successors of the kingdom of Lordaeron, which was destroyed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">the Scourge</a> in <em>Warcraft III</em>. This naturally brings them into conflict with the Forsaken, the Horde-aligned faction of free-willed undead that the Crusade <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanHelsingHateCrimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanHelsingHateCrimes">sees as indistinguishable from the non-sentient undead Scourge.</a> But with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">both</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">factions</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">using</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithSyringes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithSyringes">rather</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague">questionable</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">methods</a>, their conflict can be seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGreyMorality">Black and Grey Morality</a> at best.
<ul><li> The Scarlet Crusade is a particularly enduring Remnant as well. Over <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em> it lost its leadership in Northrend, and by the <em>Cataclysm</em> expansion their forces in the Eastern Plaguelands were turned into undead, their fortress in the Western Plaguelands was taken over by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Argent Crusade</a>, and they're basically down to the Scarlet Monastery and some scattered holdings in Tirisfal Glades. The game attributes their continued survival to High Inquisitor Whitemane — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">as a Priest, she can revive the fallen.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> The Twilight Hammer cult served the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of <em>Cataclysm</em> and by the final raid of the expansion, their numbers were supposedly down to only a few dozen. They nonetheless continue to show up in both <em>Legion</em> and <em>Battle for Azeroth</em>, albeit as minor enemies rather than a significant faction.
</li></ul></li><li> Any time a faction is defeated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarlockMasterOfTheArcane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarlockMasterOfTheArcane">Warlock: Master Of The Arcane</a></em>, all their cities and units remain in the game as "Neutrals". These cities do no longer play to win and are hostile to everyone, except other neutrals.

During the time of the first game, this was one of the most powerful factions in Temeria. By the time of the third game, the faction lost almost all of its power due to the political schemes of King Radovid V. What is left of the Order are nothing but roving bandits wearing ornate looking armour.
<ul><li> The Scoiatael (elven rebels) had also become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant">The Remnant</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant">The Remnant</a>.

He only finds out the war has ended by stealing Archer's smartphone and looking up old newsreels which displayed the dropping of the bombs on Japan, although Archer reunites Kintaru with his still-alive family.

During seasons 1-5, the Foot frequently used vehicles, mecha and scientifically created mutants. In <em>Back to the Sewer</em>, all that remains are Khan, a bunch of Foot Ninja and a digital clone of the Shredder.

</li><li> Japanese holdouts, also known as stragglers, were soldiers (usually stationed on small islands in the Philippines or up and down the Pacific coast) who either did not learn or did not believe that World War II was over, and Japan had surrendered. The latest confirmed holdouts lasted until 1974, a full <em>twenty-nine years</em> after the war's end, with more rumored until the turn of the century. This was a particular problem as these holdouts were often single soldiers, resorting to guerrilla tactics against local law enforcement in fighting a war they still believed was ongoing.
<ul><li> Onoda Hiroo would not believe the news until his now-retired former commanding officer was flown in to personally order him to stand down. In 1974. When he surrendered, he still had his army sword and original issue rifle in full-working order. During that entire time, Onada continued to fight as a guerrilla force, raiding and burning the property and crops of local Filipino villagers; it is estimated that he killed about 30 people during his private war.

<ul><li> The last ship to fly the Confederate flag (CSS Shenandoah, a commerce raider) reached port (in England to avoid accusations of piracy) and officially struck its colors in November of 1865 (about 5 months after most of the rest of the Confederate forces). It spent most of the intervening time getting months-old bad news occasionally whenever it would raid "enemy" shipping.
</li><li> Robert E. Lee deliberately refused to go down this path, against the advice of several of his subordinates, and chose surrender rather than continuing increasingly futile bloodshed as bandits for years or even decades to come.
</li><li> Part of the reason for the popularity of the Ku Klux Klan was a romantic desire to continue the fight and ensure the South rose again. The Klan soon chose to direct its violence towards the most visible symbol of the North's victory, emancipated negroes (they also shot back less than US troops).
</li><li> "Confederados" are Brazilian descendants of Southerners who accepted subsidized transport to Brazil, cheap land, and tax breaks from the Brazilian Empire to establish a new life away from the destruction of war and Northern rule, as long as they cultivate cotton.
</li></ul></li><li> This was a feature of some nations' defense planning during the 20th century; in fact, during the Bush 43 administration, Donald Rumsfeld and Condi Rice used the German stay-behind "force" Werwolf as part of the justification for continuing the Iraq War. NATO, under United States direction, did much the same thing in much of western Europe as a poison pill in case of Communist invasion (the plan is best known by the Italian name, Operation Gladio); sounds sensible, right? Except many Gladio recruits were some of their nations' most outspoken fascists and thugs.
<ul><li> Became an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">Invoked Trope</a> with the Iraqi resistance being dubbed the "dead-enders" to suggest they were only resisting Coalition forces out of loyalty to the deposed Saddam Hussein. This was dropped when the war continued long after the Iraqi dictator was executed.
</li><li> Nevertheless, loyalists of Saddams Arab Baath Party formed a major faction of the Iraqi insurgency against the US and the new Iraqi government. Despite holding a secular ideology, they formed and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> with al-Qaeda and later, ISIS. As of 2020, some Baathist militant groups continue to hold out, although they are heavily diminished and no longer a threat to the Iraqi federal government.
</li></ul></li><li> For that matter, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Nazis'</a> <em>Werwolf</em> project itself. Originally devised as an underground network of soldiers that would conduct sabotage and guerilla warfare in those parts of Germany that would soon be occupied by the Allies forces, it was never seriously intended as a last-ditch effort to retain control over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a>. Its propaganda value far outweighed its practical use, and it is because of this that the Allies over-estimated its effectiveness and actual threat level.
<ul><li> Ironically, despite the popularity of "nazi holdout faction" idea in fiction, Hitler himself was strongly against any such ideas. In his view, the war was all about survival of the fittest, and therefore if Germany became defeated, then it failed as "master race" and have no reason to even exist anymore. Other Nazi leadership may have different opinion, but were sensibly reluctant do argue with increasingly more insane Adolph about the core points of Nazi doctrine.
</li><li> To this day there are neo-Nazi groups and indivduals attempting to reinstate fascism and racism. Unlike the originals however they're not a legitimate military power but more akin to terrorists. Often subverted in that they generally don't have a very good understanding of what the Nazis actually wanted. They will often say that Hitler just wanted "strong borders" and that he never really did <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust">the Holocaust</a>, despite saying that the Holocaust didn't really happen they will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">often say they want to do it again and that they're glad it happened.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> After ISIS lost its last territorial holdings in Iraq and Syria, many diehards continued fighting as insurgents. Their numbers are significant enough to pose a serious security threat to local authorities. Nonetheless, they are a shadow of the terror ISISs caliphate represented at its height.
</li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober">Russian Civil War</a>, there were several White warlords in the Russian Far East who were still fighting months or even years after the main White armies/governments in Crimea and Siberia were destroyed (1920). The most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinatoriffic</a> of these was General Pepelyaev, who led a raid on several towns in Yakutia in 1923, when the LAST White remnant in the Maritime province was already fallen. Another notable example is Baron <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RomanVonUngernSternberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RomanVonUngernSternberg">Roman von Ungern-Sternberg</a>, who kept raiding in the Soviet Union and Mongolia until his own men handed him over to the Bolsheviks and left for China and exile.
<ul><li> Some anti-Bolshevik holdouts in Russia either returned from exile or emerged from hiding to join the Nazis in the fight against the communists. It did not end well.
</li><li> A very unusual Russian example are the Old Believers, who were persecuted by the mainstream Russian Orthodox church and a fair number of whom still live apart from society. Why? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Old Believers continue using three fingers to make the sign of the cross while the church changed it to two fingers</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2nvwj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2nvwj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2nvwj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">though this was far from the only theological dispute of the <em>raskol</em>, it's the most iconic one.</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Eastern Europe's non-communist undergrounds left over from WWII certainly count. Many of these organizations had been fighting for nearly half a decade or more when WWII ended, and many continued the fight after the Soviets marched in and set up their clients. In many cases they were conducting guerilla warfare until the eighties. The last Polish group of freedom fighters was captured in 1965. Allegedly some of the groups were blowing up support trains for Germans on the Eastern Front. Many of them included former soldiers of the Waffen-SS Legion (often, locals who had joined the SS believing at the time that the Nazis were better than the Soviets).
</li><li> The various Anti-Soviet groups (Forest Brethren/Forest Brothers depending on translation from Estonian/Latvian/Lithuanian) in the Baltics in general. Though the Soviets moved in for good in 1944, guerrilla fighters in the woodlands remained active until well after Stalin's death, with pardons issued to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a> leaders and the mass deportations of rebels to the GULAG ended. Of course, some of them just stayed in the woods even after that and kept up the fight. The last fighters of the Forest Brethren (Metsavõnnud) of Estonia were crushed in 1979, the Latvian mea brāļi (pronounced <em>mezha braal'i</em> ) fought until ~1957, and the Lithuanian miko broliai (<em>mishko broliai</em>) until 1971, just in time for the 80s and Gorbachev to get everyone back in the habit of protesting those commies only to get their independence in 1991. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">The Determinator</a> anybody?
</li><li> Whenever the leadership of a terrorist movement decides to give up violence despite not having fulfilled its goals, it is likely that a splinter faction will continue fighting.
</li><li> After the Boer Wars, there were still groups of Boer guerrillas roaming the South African countryside; they were known as Bitter-Enders and refused to admit defeat against British forces.
</li><li> When Mao won the Chinese Civil War in 1949, most of his enemies fled to Taiwan. They fortified the island and prepared for the eventual reconquest of the mainland. Chiang Kai-Shek initially didn't even bother to develop the Taiwanese economy or infrastructure; he didn't expect to be staying there long. It wasn't until <em>1987</em> that martial law was lifted. The country is still officially called the Republic of China, founded by Sun Yat-Sen in 1911 before anyone had ever heard of Mao; and <em>to this day</em> there are hardcore members of the Nationalist Party who hope to see China reunited under their banners.
<ul><li> Not to say that all resistance had ceased on the mainland when Mao claimed victory in 1949: there was a fairly prolonged campaign of clean-ups, including pro-Chiang guerrillas operating from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThatSouthEastAsianCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThatSouthEastAsianCountry">Burma</a> in the '50s that were sponsored by the CIA, who helped them to smuggle Heroin and Opium to fund their war, until 1961 when a joint Sino-Burmese force forced the Nationalists to retreat to Laos, while others escaped to Thailand and returned to Taiwan (some choose to stay and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingNative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingNative">form families</a>). The ones in Laos returned to drug trade until the holdouts entered in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meleeatrois" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meleeatrois">three-way conflict</a> with local drug warlords and a rogue CIA-backed Laoting general for the control of 16 tons of Opium. At that point they were barely under control of the KMT and were no different from common drug dealers.
</li><li> Muslim chinese loyal to the Kuomitang led by the Ma clique warlords led a guerilla campaign in Northwest China and Yunnan until their leaders were captured and executed in 1958.
</li><li> The first wave of soldiers sent to fight in the Korean War were also comprised of some ex-Nationalist/ warlord troops who were more or less sent in as cannon fodder.
</li><li> This trope is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">enforced</a> for Taiwan: officially, the Republic of China not only claims the whole territory of the People's Republic of China, but also Mongolia, parts of Burma and Tajikstan and anywhere else even nominally part of the Empire when it fell apart (not much different from PRC today). This is because although even the hardliners have no intention of reconquering all of this territory, actually changing their definition of the Republic in any way would be an official acknowledgement of "two Chinas", and thus would be perceived as a provocative move by the People's Republic.
<ul><li> As of 2008 the claim on Mongolia has been officially dead, with ROC officials now says Mongolia has ceased to be "lawful territory" of Republic of China under current constitution. Other areas have only minor difference from PRC's claim line, and the full ROC map had fallen into disuse after 2000s—now map of ROC simply shows Taiwan and its associated islands, a number of islands in Fujian and South China Sea that are "free".
</li></ul></li><li> To clarify (or not): Both the government in Beijing and the one in Taipei agree that there is only one China, they merely disagree on who has the legitimate claim to be in charge and to some degree what the borders of that One China are. In recent years they have quietly taken on a policy of ignoring the elephant in the living room and hoping nobody brings it up, as neither side really wants the trouble of fighting a war over it.
</li><li> Both Taiwan and Mongolia have been homes of various remnants of Chinese dynasties at different times. After being displaced by the Ming in China itself, the khans of the House of Genghis Khan, who still ruled in Mongolia, claimed to be the legitimate rulers of all China as emperors of the Yuan Dynasty. Only the absorption of both the Ming and the Yuan remnants by the Manchu Qing dynasty extinguished this claim. After the fall of the Ming, Zheng Chenggong, a one time pirate also known to the Europeans as Koxinga, declared himself loyal to the fallen Ming Dynasty and established a de facto independent state called the Kingdom of Tungning on Taiwan after displacing the Dutch who had previously established an outpost there. This remnant lasted a full generation before being conquered by the Qing imperial troops in 1683 and Zheng remains a major folk hero in Taiwan.
</li></ul></li><li> Happened during the War of 1812 due to the amount of time it took for information to travel in those days; the treaty ending the war was signed in December 1814 but combat continued into the following year. Of particular note is the Battle of New Orleans, fought January 8, 1815, as the Americans' overwhelming victory both compelled the British to abide by the terms of the treaty and propelled Major General <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AndrewJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AndrewJackson">Andrew Jackson</a> to a successful run at the presidency.
</li><li> Even after Franco won the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishCivilWar">Spanish Civil War</a>, the Republicans' various remnants kept trying to fight him for decades, even until the day Franco died.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Belarus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Belarus">Belarus</a>, with its quasi-communism, state-controlled industries, a strong arm President backed up by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">State Sec</a> (which is even called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MoscowCentre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MoscowCentre">KGB</a>) and a very Soviet-looking flag and coat of arms, can be seen as The Remnant of the Soviet Union. Minsk remains quite possibly the only former Soviet capital to have kept virtually all of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommieLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommieLand">Commie Land</a> monuments, even most Belorussians (roughly 70%) list Russian as their primary language and it remains an official language still used heavily in education and politics.
<ul><li> The "Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic" is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentInExile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentInExile">Government in Exile</a> of the <em>Belarusian People's Republic</em>, a republic founded during the russian civil war and that existed until 1919 when it was invaded by Bolshevik troops. After the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessUp">fall of the Soviet Union</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightfulKingReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightfulKingReturns">many pre-communist governments-in-exile were able to take power back</a> (Like in the Baltics or Poland), however, Belarus instead was taken over by the current government instead, as such, the Rada has been in exile since 1919, making it the oldest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentInExile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentInExile">Government in Exile</a> existing.
</li></ul></li><li> Transnistria (an unrecognised but <em>de facto</em> independent breakaway state within the territory of Moldova) may similarly be considered a Remnant of the Soviet Union, continuing to operate a <em>literal</em> Soviet government (although not communist), and using the associated iconography (hammer and sickle, Lenin, etc.) on official monuments and state symbols.
</li><li> The followers of the British King James II, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HanoverStuartWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HanoverStuartWars">Jacobites</a>, became this after he is ousted in 1688, to the point of having two attempted rebellions to try and regain the throne; an abortive one in 1715, and an almost successful one in 1745.
</li><li> Enver Pasha, one of the Triumvirate of "Young Turks" that ruled the Ottoman Empire during World War I. In 1922 he turned up in Central Asia organizing Muslim tribes in the hope of recreating the Ottoman Empire from scratch, in the midst of the Soviet Union no less. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">It didn't work out</a>.
</li><li> The French OAS, consisting of disgruntled military leaders, pied noirs (descendents of European settlers) and far-right extremists, attempted to continue the Algerian War even after Charles De Gaulle began negotiations with the FLN. Unable to seriously disrupt the peace process through paramilitary attacks on Algerians, they soon began targeting French officials and ultimately De Gaulle himself.
</li><li> The Principality of Liechtenstein has been described as the last functioning remnant of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire">Holy Roman Empire</a>, having survived both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoléon Bonaparte</a>'s dissolution of said Empire and the later collapse of Austria-Hungary in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>.
</li><li> When the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RomanEmpire">Roman Empire</a> in the West fell in AD 476, it was survived by a number of remnant-states. Julius Nepos continued to address himself as 'Emperor', ruling from the province of Dalmatia in the Balkans until his death in AD 480.
<ul><li> The warlord Aegidius and later his son, Syagrius, continued to hold out against barbarian incursions in northern Gaul (France) from the city of Soissons until King Clovis I of the Franks conquered and added their lands to his own petty kingdom in 486. Clovis' consolidation of power and territory would lay the foundations for the medieval French monarchy.
</li><li> The largest, and most successful, remnant was the Byzantine Empire, embracing the eastern provinces of Greece, Anatolia (Turkey), Syria, and Egypt. The Byzantine Empire lasted for a thousand years, its rulers loftly styling themselves 'Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans'.
<ul><li> After the sack of Constantinople in 1204 during the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantine Empire itself spun off a number of remnant states, each of which claimed to be its rightful successor. One of these (the Empire of Nicaea) later recaptured Constantinople and put its emperor on the rightful throne, while the longest-lived successor state (the Empire of Trebizond) maintained an independent existence until 1461, eight years after the fall of Constantinople itself to the Turks.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Wales was conquered by England in the late 1100's. In the following centuries there were sporadic rebellions against English rule, the most successful being by the prince Owain Glyndwr in the 1400's. An organisation called the Meibion Glyndwr — Sons of Glyndwr — still exists today, although dormant, in the way a rump IRA continued between the War of Independence in 1921 (only to leap into active life again in 1969). In the 1960's, traffic signs written in English only were destroyed until the British Government agreed to dual-language signage in all of Wales, with Welsh taking precedence over English in the West. In the 1970's and 80's, second homes in Wales bought by English-speakers were under threat of being firebombed. In a very real way, a Remnant is still fighting English rule nine hundred years on — although very, very, much marginalised and made insignificant after a series of concessions to Welsh nationalism.
</li><li> The Kingdom of Navarre was a medieval kingdom in the northern Iberian Peninsula, at a time in which what is now Spain was divided between several petty kingdoms. Gradually these kingdoms conglomerated until all of modern Spain save Navarre was at least unofficially unified by 1492. In 1512, Spain conquered virtually all of Navarre except for a tiny portion north of the Pyrenees, where the former Kings of Navarre remained as a kind of government in exile. In 1589, King Henry of Navarre succeeded to the French throne. From 1589 right up to 1830, every French monarch (except Napoleon) styled himself 'King of France <em>and</em> Navarre' despite the overwhelming majority of what had been Navarre being part of Spain.
<ul><li> Fairly common in European history. Kings of England claimed to be legitimate kings of France, on the basis of the claims that Hundred Years' War were fought over in the Middle Ages, until after the French Revolution was well under way. This included the Stuart predenders who were subsidized by the actual kings of France! Kings of Spain still claim the title "King of Jerusalem," as in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, established (and destroyed) during the Crusades.
</li></ul></li><li> A man fled to the jungle during the 1969 "Football War" between El Salvador and Honduras. He finally "surrendered" to a group of lumberjacks he mistook for enemy soldiers more than 30 years later, telling them he was tired of running away. The saddest part is that the actual war lasted a total of <em>four days</em>.
</li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfTheRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfTheRoses">Wars of the Roses</a>, Calais gained an infamous reputation for being The Remnant of whichever faction was out of power at the time. Calais itself became The Remnant of the British monarchy's attempts to rule in France, remaining an English possession for another hundred years after Joan of Arc and her buddies kicked the English out of the rest of France. For that matter, British monarchs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact">continued styling themselves</a> King/Queen of France well into the 18th Century.
</li><li> The Channel Islands are the last remnants of extensive English holdings in medieval France. The Queen of United Kingdom rules them to this day as the Duke (not the duchess) of Normandy, as did William the Conqueror a thousand years before.
</li><li> The Sicarii, Jewish rebels who occupied the fortress of Masada for years after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JewishRevolts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JewishRevolts">Jewish Revolts</a> had been put down. They were eventually besieged by the Romans, and committed mass suicide to avoid capture.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNetherlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNetherlands">The Netherlands</a> fell during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars">The Napoleonic Wars</a>, the trading outpost of Dejima suddenly found itself as the only place left where the Dutch flag flew. The fact that the Dutch outpost also happened to be off the coast of Nagasaki in Tokugawa-era Japan probably helped.
</li><li> Pre-skinhead-era neo-Nazis — the kind who do not cut their hair and who embrace fascism as well as racism — are (or were) an interesting case. They seem to understand that Hitler's war is long over and do not launch military maneuvers, or for that matter even behave all that violently. But they're still wearing the now horribly outdated <em>Sturmabteilungen</em> uniforms, and speak of Hitler as an almost immortal being.
</li><li> The Spanish garrison in Baler, Philippines bunkered in the local church and resisted the siege by Filipino forces until June 2, 1899, missing out the Spanish-American War completely.
</li><li> Hermann Detzner was a German engineer who surrendered to Australian forces in New Guinea on January 5, 1919, two months after Germany signed the Armistice of Compiègne and four years and four months after the Australians conquered the German colony's capital. Detzner claimed to have kept the fight, flying German colors and singing German hymns for the duration of the war, and as a result, to be the last remaining soldier of the German Empire. The Australians insisted that he was a harmless civilian and that they had known his whereabouts the entire time, however.
</li><li> Ottoman Lieutenant General Fakhri Pasha rejected the Armistice of Mudros and disobeyed all orders from the Ottoman government to surrender Medina, where he was besieged by Arab forces. After two months, he was arrested by his own troops and handed to the enemy on January 9, 1919, who kept him as a prisoner for two years. He immediately joined Atatürk's forces upon his release and fought against the invading Greek and French armies in the Turkish War of Independence.
</li><li> After decisively losing the First Libyan Civil War in 2011, some forces loyal to ousted dictator Muammar Gaddafi continued fighting. They lacked any significant popular support, were generally disorganized and isolated, and proved to be only a minor faction in the Second Libyan Civil War that began in 2014.
</li><li> Multiple examples from the Vietnam War and subsequent conflicts:
<ul><li> Various insurgent groups comprised of remote ethnic minorities, most notably the Montagnards and Hmong, sprung up during the war and came to be supported by the United States. After communist victory in the war, many of these insurgent groups continued to fight, with some forces holding out into the 90s. Tragically, communist authorities in Laos and Vietnam responded with campaigns of collective punishment against the Hmong and Montagnards, which sometimes reached genocidal proportions.
</li><li> Remnants of Pol Pots infamous Khmer Rouge held out for twenty years. After being ousted in 1979 by their former Vietnamese communist allies, a large portion of their forces regrouped in Thailand. They then launched an insurgency against the Vietnamese-backed government of Cambodia, fighting as part of a broader rebel coalition that included non-communist and monarchist groups. In the early 1990s, the latter groups signed a peace agreement, but the Khmer Rouge continued fighting until its final collapse in 1999.
