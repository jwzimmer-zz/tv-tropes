<ul><li> The Wall Cult from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>. They began as an oft-ignored group of zealots that worshiped the Walls as a divine gift but rapidly gained influence and authority after the loss of Wall Maria. They oppose any and all efforts to strengthen the defenses of the remaining Walls and advocate for the execution of Eren. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out these efforts are to prevent anyone from learning the truth about the Walls, including that they contain dormant Colossal Titans. All of this is to keep the people trapped inside the Walls from escaping from the frying pan only to spread the fire — the Kingdom of Marley is a fascist country that wants everyone related to the Titans dead or enslaved as cannon fodder. That said, the church leader is also a ruthless jerkass who would rather let everyone behind the second wall die than face Marley.</span>
</li><li> The Religious Order of the Holy See of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> are as corrupt and tyrannical as you can expect a religious group with a good amount of power in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> of the series to get, made worse by clues that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they're actually worshipping the Godhand, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a> of the setting, rather than the Four Elemental Kings</span>. The main activity of its adherents seems to be stamping out "heresy" however they can, with Mozgus being the absolute worst in this regard.
</li><li> The Ripoff Church in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em>; it's unlikely their smuggling, their gunplay, their money-grubbing, or their hiring of foul-mouthed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardDrinkingPartyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardDrinkingPartyGirl">Hard-Drinking Party Girl</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NunTooHoly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NunTooHoly">Nuns</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGunslinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGunslinger">with guns</a> are endorsed by the Catholic church as a whole.
<ul><li> Not to mention that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the whole thing is a cover for CIA Station Post.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The Church of Ente Isla in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheDevilIsAPartTimer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheDevilIsAPartTimer">The Devil Is a Part-Timer!</a></em> turns out to be one. Their plan was to raise Emilia as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tykebomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tykebomb">Tyke-Bomb</a> and secretly sabotage the war effort so that the fate of the world fell on the shoulders of their chosen "Hero". Then after Emilia defeats Satan, the Church quietly gets rid of her (by faking a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>) so that they can take the credit and political influence. They even used Inquisitors to act as their own personal secret police and eliminate anyone who stood in their way. Though High Priest Olba is the chief architect of this, the other higher-ups aren't much better.
</li><li> The Vatican in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the entire upper hierarchy is apparently a bunch of blind-to-the-truth bastards... and are made of a couple akuma, as well.</span> Not the exorcists. Just the Vatican.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It is unknown to what extent the Vatican is corrupt but it is heavily implied that it extents to veeeery high level. And we have yet to see the pope...</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Dokuro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Dokuro">Dokuro</a></em>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cult">Nirvana Church of Creation</a>, a seemingly benevolent religion that uses assassins like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Takeo</a> to do its dirty work, and whose founder is corrupt as all get-out, with what he did to Takeo's mother not even coming close to the true extent of his evil.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullMetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullMetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> has the Church of Letoism led by Father Cornello, a priest using a philosophers stone ring to perform "miracles" and fool the citizens of Lior into believing a fabricated religion so he can use them as soldiers to help him take over the country.
</li><li> The Church of the Black Cross in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GlassFleet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GlassFleet">Glass Fleet</a></em>. The pope murdered the previous king and later stages a <em>coup d'etat</em> against the current emperor. Not to mention that the "black cross" it worships is actually a black hole that will eventually kill everyone if they don't move away from it.
</li><li> The Catholic Church in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em>. After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Millennium attacks London, they send their army of a couple thousand knights in helicopters to England. Will they aid in the purging of the undead? Well, yes, but they will also kill all English men, women, and children because they're all dirty heathens</span>. This may seem like a "normal" act of zealotry that would not fall under this category, that and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Maxwell was responsible for most of this</span>, but even before that, they still have <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a secret special force of kamikaze priests with guns and swords led by Anderson, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy">Axe-Crazy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> priest that kills zombies, vampires, and heathens alike. And don't forget the aforementioned mechanized army</span>.
<ul><li> In regards to the Protestant side, the Anglican Church certainly counts as well. Their primary fighting force, the Hellsing Organization, employs an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> as their trump card and unleashes him upon any monster or human that they view as a sufficient threat to the general populace of England. Very effective, of course, but Alucard can be even more homicidal and bloodthirsty than Anderson when Integra isn't exerting full control over him.
</li></ul></li><li> The Church of the Light Spirit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MaoyuuMaouYuusha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MaoyuuMaouYuusha">Maoyuu Maou Yuusha</a></em> is deliberately perpetuating the war in order to retain authority and undermine the southern kingdoms that are more difficult to control.
</li><li> The Church of the Three Heroes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheRisingOfTheShieldHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheRisingOfTheShieldHero">The Rising of the Shield Hero</a></em>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister">High Priest</a> takes advantage of the crisis with the waves, as well as the King of Melromarc's personal beef with the Shield Hero to demonize him and have the populace treat him with scorn. Later, they use the incompetence of the Sword, Spear, and Bow Heroes as an excuse to kill them, and then overthrow the government to take control of the kingdom, which not only succeeds in uniting the Four Heroes against him, but also is the only time that Naofumi and his archnemesis <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">Malty</a> join forces for a common goal, due to Malty, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">of all people</a>, being horrified at the true extent of the * High Priest's plan.
</li><li> The Church of Origin in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/RollOverAndDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/RollOverAndDie">Roll Over and Die</a></em> is this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. The rank and file are good and decent people genuinely trying to make the world a better place, but the upper echelons are corrupt as hell. Known to the general public, they have conspired with the nobility and royalty to outlaw any and all medical treatment that does not involve their own healing magic as "heretical," purely for the sake of maintaining a monopoly, dooming countless people to suffer and die under easily treatable ailments that their healers can't deal with because the effective medicine is outlawed. Clergy members who try to circumvent this and allow the herbal remedies to be used can find themselves <em>illegally</em> being dragged off to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">Kangaroo Court</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReleasedToElsewhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReleasedToElsewhere">"be excommunicated."</a> Flum and a young acolyte Sara find hard evidence that the church is involved in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodhoodSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodhoodSeeker">Godhood Seeker</a> human experimentation and that the most heinous of the atrocities laid at the feet of the Demons were in fact false flag operations, purely to get convenient true believers and test subjects. Even the "god" they want to release is implied to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a> that wants to wipe out all life.
</li><li> The Church in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SpiceAndWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SpiceAndWolf">Spice and Wolf</a></em> is considered essentially as an unfairly privileged business enterprise by the various merchants seen in the series, and practically everyone is willing to turn a blind eye to things the Church opposes, and even help its enemies, as long as there is no immediate threat of being caught. Since the Church considers being deformed a capital offense and happily uses its power to make profit at the expense of others, these opinions seem quite justified.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em> comics introduced us to the Order of St. Dumas, a heretical Catholic sect started during the Crusades by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">murderous Swiss knight</a> Chartrien Dumas. Dumas went so far as to have his men slaughter emissaries from the Vatican without provocation and declare himself Pope. He also began a tradition of "holy" vigilantism, wherein the title of "Azrael" (a sword-wielding "angel") would assassinate "sinners," often simply as a pretext for seizing their wealth from them. (For centuries, the Order of St. Dumas was — secretly — the single wealthiest organization on Earth.) Fathers prepared their sons to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeUpMySword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeUpMySword">succeed them</a> as the avenging angel, subjecting them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">grueling physical training</a> and weird, mind-warping rituals. The heir to this violent tradition, Jean-Paul Valley, moved to Gotham City to attend college and quickly became Bruce Wayne's apprentice. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">Things went downhill from there...</a>
</li><li> The Elseworld tale <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanHolyTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanHolyTerror">Batman: Holy Terror</a></em> depicts an alternate reality when Oliver Cromwell lived another ten years and turned the Church of England into a brutal theocracy, which arranged for the deaths of Thomas and Martha Wayne simply because Thomas Wayne treated 'undesirables' such as Jews and homosexuals, as well as conducting twisted experiments on metahumans like Barry Allen to try harnessing their powers for the use of the state.
</li><li> In the comic book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDarkness">The Darkness</a></em>, there's organization that formally employed The Magdalena, which is heavily implied to be descended from the Inquisition.

</li><li> With a more sinister intent, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackChick">Jack Chick</a> devoted his life to producing hair-raising comic tracts to push his view of Christianity. This was somewhere on the furthest paranoid extreme of American religion, where anything that did not think or act or believe in the same way Chick did represent a Satanic plot to drag people into Hell, even and especially other forms of Christianity. The Roman Catholic Church was one of his monsters — institutional, corrupt, evil, and thoroughly contaminated by Satan.

<ul><li> The Church of Humanity, an offshoot of the notorious anti-mutant hate group Friends of Humanity, also qualifies.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatWarriorSkanderbeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatWarriorSkanderbeg">The Great Warrior Skanderbeg</a></em> is a similar example to <em>Alexander Nevsky</em> due to being a Soviet-Albanian production and as such, any religious authority or figure represented in the movie is invariably corrupt.

</li><li> Taken to an almost absurd degree by the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingArthur">King Arthur</a></em>, going so far as to invent a martyrdom for the historical heretic Pelagius and portray Saint Germanus of Auxerre (who died two decades before the film is set) as a backstabbing tyrant.
<ul><li> Not quite as absurd as you might think, in the case of Germanus. While the example of Pelagius is a total slap in the face to history, men in Germanus' position — Roman Catholic Bishops of the time the film is set in — weren't above engaging in (by our modern standards) ruthless moves and chess-playing with the lives of men both powerful and influential (and thereby the lives of everyone beneath them or influenced by them) in their flock to ensure the church in the area they were Bishop of remained the sole ultimate authority. Granted, they were much more discreet and subtle in their machinations than Germanus ever was in the film, but much like the Pope of the time, the Bishops were equally ruthless political power-players. No act is too ill when you do it in the name of God, after all.

However, the director's cut features a fairly sympathetic bishop who stated that "Much is done in Christendom of which Christ would be incapable," and reveals that the actions of the priest in France were all against explicit orders.

</li><li> In the novel <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beyond">Beyond</a></em>, the church changes its doctrine to fit its political doctrine.

</li><li> French science-fiction writer Pierre Bordage is fond of this trope, which he included in many of his works. Often, the protagonists even discover elements proving that the founders of the church were truly inspired people and that the organization they founded simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">went horribly wrong</a>, sometimes out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">sheer fanaticism</a>.
</li><li> <em>Burden of the Emperor</em> series by Iar Elterrus (<em>Бремя Императора</em>, Иар Эльтеррус): the most successful conspiracy against the Empire heavily involved the church, including the death of the Emperor. An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">old document</a> testifying to the peaceful demise of an imperial dignitary in a monastery several centuries ago leads to a massive revision of the church history. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The church was actually slowly, carefully and deliberately pushed from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaintlyChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaintlyChurch">Saintly Church</a> into this trope with a good helping of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteXenophobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteXenophobe">Absolute Xenophobe</a> on the side</span>.
</li><li> Evangelical Christianity in America is this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChristianNation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChristianNation">Christian Nation</a></em> as they slowly take control of the government, going so far as to abolish the separation of church and state and declaring a "holy war" on the last holdouts of American democracy and freedom, eventually calling themselves Church Of God in America. They also use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherIsWatching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherIsWatching">surveillance technology</a> such as the Purity Web to keep tabs on the populace in the hopes of keeping them under their control.

In both, the generic "The Church" has no discernible reason for existing other than to make Our Heroes miserable, as it has no connection with the real life of the rest of the population, and no visible theology other than "wizards are evil".

In that one, an honorable and upstanding Parisian Jewish merchant named Abraham is constantly beseeched by his Christian friend and fellow businessman Jehannot de Chevigny to convert to Christianity; to decide whether he should do so, Abraham goes to Rome in order to observe the Church hierarchy — which causes Jehannot to go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a>, as although he's portrayed as kind of an idiot, he knows full well how corrupt the Church of his time is.

Since gods on the Discworld are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly">sustained by belief</a>, this has very negative consequences for Om himself.
</li><li> Dante's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy">The Divine Comedy</a></em> depicts a number of corrupt churchmen from Dante's time in Hell (including several popes), and one in Purgatory. Overall, Dante presents an extremely unflattering opinion of the 14th-century Catholic Church... which was, by all accounts, very accurate.

</li><li> Cosmic Unity in the science fiction novel <em>Heaven</em> by Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen. Starting with the idea that inter-planetary war would be so destructive everyone must join together to form a, well, cosmic unity, it has become a fundamentalist group bent on assimilating everyone, preaching tolerance to all differences as long as everyone consents to become exactly the same under the church. They combine a genuinely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour">Orwellian</a> attitude with some subvertingly literalistic applications of the original compassionate doctrines of their founders.

</li><li> The institution of the Magisterium in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials">His Dark Materials</a></em>. Distinct from the "thinly-veiled Catholic churches" of fantasy because it's not veiled at all; it is simply the Catholic Church in another dimension. It is one where John Calvin ruled as Pope from Geneva... The last one, because they dissolved the position following his death, opting for a more decentralized structure.

<ul><li> It's worth noting that although it's the antagonistic force in the first novel, the Magisterium isn't inherently evil — just misguided.

Nobody involved in it seems to do any preaching, praying, or worshiping. It seems to be simply a heavy authoritarian government. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Studios demanded it</a>. However, the robes are a giveaway, there's religious imagery on the door Iorek smashes through. Its members wear priestly uniforms and speak of "heresy".

The Brothers are often more interested in protecting their order's political power and influence than in doing good, positioning "spiritual advisors" (i.e. manipulators and spies) with as many ruler as possible. The Sisters don't have similar power but are riven by infighting, factionalism, and personal ambition.

Eco, an accomplished medievalist, delivers a decidedly unflattering image of an eminent abbey that has become a festering nest of petty politicking, depravity, cloak-and-dagger subterfuge, and outright religious lunacy. Just about the <em>only</em> clergyman treated somewhat favorably in the entire novel is Brother William — and he's a closet heretic.
<ul><li> Keep in mind that, in the time period that <em>The Name of the Rose</em> is set in, the Papacy and the monasteries were engaged in a <em><strong>civil war</strong></em> which only ended because of shady powerbrokering. And Adso, Severinus, and (to a degree) Salvatore are all treated favourably... but Salvatore's another heretic.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStormlightArchive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStormlightArchive">The Stormlight Archive</a></em>: Played with.
<ul><li> Thousands of years ago, the Vorin church formed the Hierocracy, a theocracy ruled by the priests. They taught that religion was a mysterious, supernatural thing beyond the understanding of normal people and that everything should be left to the priests. They justified their rule with prophecies and mystical promises from the Almighty. They even tried to conquer the entire world for its own good. Eventually, an Alethi warlord later known as the Sunmaker raised an army against the church. When he interrogated the priests, he discovered that there were no prophecies; everything was a lie. Vorinism was shattered into the Devotiaries, small sects of priests dedicated to worshiping the Almighty in one specific way. The priests were replaced with the ardents, slaves who learn and teach religion but leave enforcement to the nobles. The ardents help people choose a Glory and a Calling and let them advance themselves in the Almighty's eyes on their own. Anything more is expressly forbidden.
</li><li> One of the big flaws in the Devotiaries is that if the nobles decide to ignore religious rules, there is nothing his ardents can do about it. Highprince Sadeas, for example, uses slaves as cannon fodder, going through them at a horrific rate. This is against Vorin rules on treatment of slaves, but he's powerful enough that he can simply ignore the rules. Worse, his way is <em>effective</em>, and the other nobles start imitating him.
</li><li> Despite the fact that using ardents for politics is forbidden, some nobles have started using them as catspaws in their games. Again, there is nothing the ardents can do about this.
</li><li> Queen Aesudan is unintentionally at the center of one of the worst corruptions of modern Vorinism. She is in charge of Kholinar while her husband is off fighting for vengeance on the Shattered Plains. She is very worried about her place in the Almighty's plan and has many ardents to help her. Unfortunately for everyone involved, the ardents have discovered that all they need to do is lavish her with praise, and she will return the favor with expensive food, gifts, and other luxuries. A new ardent is horrified at both the material and spiritual cost and resolves to do something about it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This new ardent publicly denounces the queen's many failings, and the queen orders her executed.

Of course, they're just one source of trouble, as crazy Pagan fanatics and various people with no ideology besides gaining wealth and power also cause all sorts of problems.

Perhaps understandably so, as the churchmen cheerfully approve massacres and literal witch burnings of enemies of the faith, as well as the enslavement of captured Azanian Amazons and a holy crusade and war of annihilation against this unnatural, Godless society ruled by women.

<dl><dd><ul><li> The Catholic Church in The Black Scourge has all the corruption and nastiness of the pre-Reformation church and then some. Specifically, the Pope got tired of playing cat-and-mouse with the Holy Roman Emperor, has him assassinated, and claimed the throne for himself. The now Emperor-Pope declared himself humanitys sole link to God, and that humanity would be forever cut-off from Heaven were he to be killed. He and his minions gleefully engage in all manner of torture against anyone they deem heretics, or otherwise threats to their power. Theres also the priest who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> kidnapped Native American boys with intent to molest them</span>.
</li><li> Hannibal One gives us <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Cult of Baal. They practice human sacrifice, use drugs for their rituals, and use intimidation and threats of violence to keep dissonant members in line</span>.
</li><li> The priests of the pharaoh in May His Kah Endure Forever trick the peoples of Egypt into giving tribute to the deceased pharaoh. They pocket offerings for themselves and use the pharaohs necropolis as their private palace.
</li><li> Subverted in Mask of the Plague Doctor where the lone Catholic priest we see attempts to serve as the voice of reason as tensions run high due to the plague.
</li><li> The religion in Court of the Giants supports a strict caste system that discriminated against the more ape-like hominids.

<ul><li> The album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Alarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Alarma">¡Alarma!</a></em> had the title track (<em>"A wise guy in the sky invites you to a guilty party / Won't charge you at the door / But sure knows how to get your money"</em>) and "Colored By" (<em>"When someone with charisma tells me 'Don't wear shoes' / I tell them 'Go back, where did you get that?'"</em>).
</li><li> The followup, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Doppelganger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Doppelganger">Doppelgänger</a></em>, was an even more thorough critique of televangelists. "New Car!" and "Angels Tuck You In" mocked the Prosperity Theology that they preached; "Do Big Boys Cry" portrayed them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">hypocrites</a> who never admit to wrongdoing; and "Autographs for the Sick" portrayed them "counting dollars in the afterglow" while utterly failing to help anyone with their ministries. "I Didn't Build It for Me" described a real-life incident where a televangelist used his followers' donations to build an obscenely lavish ministry headquarters — then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleDeniability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleDeniability">tried to claim</a> that it was really for the use of all Christians, and besides, God told him to build it.

The faith is also split into several feuding branches, one of which is a group of murderous religious bandits. It should be said, though, that his faith is also one of the most ardent opponents of the living demigod Iuz and his demon empire, and they're downright mild compared to the devil-worshipping remnants of the Great Kingdom, where the state religion was dominated by the worship of Hextor, god of tyranny and the "Herald of Hell."
</li><li> The churches of the gods <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral">Helm</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Torm</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a> had both become corrupted before the Time of Troubles.

The <em>church</em> was set up by Vol for her own purposes.

Effectively, it is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PathOfInspiration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PathOfInspiration">Path of Inspiration</a> in terms of organization and a Corrupt Church in terms of ideals.

On the one hand, the Seers of the Throne did set it up in an effort to make organized religion heavily dogmatic, so that Sleepers would be discouraged from picking at the strands of the Fallen World. On the other hand, they bought all their own hype and <em>do</em> believe the Exarchs should be worshiped as divine emanations; it's just they believe the Sleepers should also be kept ignorant and blind, and that a Sleeper worshiping one of the Exarchs would be the utmost in profanity.

The former started off as an ancestor venerating religion honoring traditions, and the latter as a religious commune intending to create peace and unity. Now the former's the epitome of an evil, corrupt church so much that they practically worship money more than anything else, while the latter are a brainwashing cult that takes care of dissenters with their "quietmen" and makes the population submissive via their Conclave Song. Nonetheless, there's still a relatively nuanced portrayal of both guilds, with heroic characters in both.

This fits with the Renaissance setting, as the Church was very corrupt at the time. Also, their religious nature in the first game is largely a sham, and in the following games they barely even give it lip service. It is also even revealed that Templars know there is no religion but use religion as a tool to control the masses. Of course the same also applies to their sworn enemies, the Assassins who in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> were an Ishmaelian sect of Muslims. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The said Pope incidentally is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the second game, while in <em>Brotherhood</em> his son has taken the reins.</span> It doesn't help that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily">the Borgias</a> were particularly active in the Renaissance-era Church.

Initially, they were successful in helping many people... infecting most of Yharnam with Old Blood, which they only later realized was the prime vector for the Beast Scourge. Knowing full well it was their own fault, the Church organized massive witch hunts and openly encouraged the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchesAndPitchforks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchesAndPitchforks">Torches and Pitchforks</a> approach, which only helped the infection spread further. Hiding their experiments and the fact the worst monsters were actually their own clerics, the Church kept on trying even as it fractured into the Choir and the School of Mensis and everything around them sank into a nightmare realm. The low-level initiates do have many decent people but at heart, the Church was basically a fraud to use Yharnam's citizenry as guinea pigs.

The Septian Church is an unabashed force for good, and the vast, vast majority of its clergy are true believers in the goddess Aidios.

Harid, one of the playable characters, was an heir of said dynasty and has resented the church since then.

Not only is it founded by a madman in order to stave off a supposed apocalypse, it's also blatantly anti-magic, racist, and very corrupt. While it does attempt to do good in the form of the Order of the Flaming Rose, which hunts monsters and protects the common people, their rule in the city of Novigrad is essentially a theocracy, where witch hunters prowl the streets and burn people at the stake daily.

They took in people who had lost family to the Scourge and offered them a new life, battling their enemy. Unfortunately, its founders were charismatic and <em>completely insane</em>, so paranoia and fanaticism was the name of the game. Unless somebody wears their colors, they're automatically assumed infected with the plague and are killed on sight. What most likely ensured their fall into Corrupt Church status was their incorporation of the disguised demons Balnazzar and Mal'Ganis as high-ranking officials. By the time they've reached Northrend to attack the Scourge, they're actually using demonic magic and thinking it's a blessing of the Light!

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em>: It'd be easier to list the number of times the Church <em>didn't</em> fuck up in a colossal way or pin the blame on the wrong people just for being different <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which is exactly <em>once</em> when Trevor commissions a local priest to consecrate some holy water during the nightly demon raid</span>. It also didn't help their reputation with the fact that the Catholic Church in Wallachia was <em>directly</em> responsible for Dracula putting a death sentence on the human race when they burned Lisa at the stake for being a witch. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Taken to the logical extreme when a group of demons attack the Bishop in the church. The Bishop — who happens to be the one who ordered Lisa's death — tries to invoke God's protection, but the lead demon claims that God is so disgusted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister">the Bishop's actions and attitudes</a> that He has forsaken the church and withdrawn His protection.</span>
</li><li> Padre Serrano's church in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SeisManos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SeisManos">Seis Manos</a></em> turns out to be a front for his cartel, selling drugs and weapons. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's a bit more complicated than that, though. Serrano is actually the rival of Season 1's main villain, the <em>jefe</em> El Balde, and has been running drugs to keep him from taking over the town of San Simon. Once he's killed, there's no one to stop El Balde from taking over.</span>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS6E8RedHotCatholicLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS6E8RedHotCatholicLove">"Red Hot Catholic Love"</a> has Father Maxi go to the Vatican to discuss priests <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt">molesting children</a>. There he finds the Cardinals all are molesters and they claim the "Holy Document of Vatican Law" does not prohibit the behavior. Even worse, the "highest authority" the Vatican answers to isn't even God but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">a giant queen spider from another dimension</a>. The Vatican arguably becomes even more corrupt when William Donahue overthrows Pope Benedict (though at least Jesus is quick to deal with him). To make matters worse, The Vatican's agents have such tremendous power that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevilInPlainSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevilInPlainSight">they are able to flaunt it without fear of reprisal</a>, even to the point of dragging naked little boys around on leashes as their "pets."
<ul><li> Other episodes of <em>South Park</em> also depict various religious institutions, like Scientology and Protestantism, to be corrupt. Mormons however are generally portrayed rather positively.
