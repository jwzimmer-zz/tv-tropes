In the older works this was more a case of No Transhumanism Existing As A Distinct Concept Yet, though they did have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels">Evolutionary Levels</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mutants">Mutants</a>, and the odd <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TelepathicSpacemen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TelepathicSpacemen">Telepathic Spacemen</a> which often served the same plot purpose.

This is probably caused by real-world technological advancements making it seem like this will become reality in the relatively near future, while older works hail from a period when this sort of thing still seemed entirely fantastic and authors therefore rarely included such themes in their stories.
</p><p>Often caused by the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostWritersAreHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostWritersAreHuman">Most Writers Are Human</a>: it's tricky to imagine what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSingularity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSingularity">a fictional society where everyone or at least the majority are no longer recognisably human</a> would be like.

It can make more sense to have everyone be regular humans wielding nifty supertools rather than transhumans with nifty superbodies and superminds, which also conveniently allows the humans in the audience to relate to the characters better by keeping their thoughts, behavior patterns and limitations familiar. Also done to sidestep <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonSuper">What Measure Is a Non-Super?</a>: the idea that humanity might be "superseded" by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels">more advanced version</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaleOfScientificSins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaleOfScientificSins">repugnant to many</a>, and the more radical the enhancements are, the more likely it will be seen as a kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a>.

</p><p>Naturally enough, Transhumans may take the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranshumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranshumanAliens">Transhuman Aliens</a>, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters">Turned Against Their Masters</a> after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndManGrewProud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndManGrewProud">Man Grew Proud</a>.
</p><p>Transhumans can end up as default villains in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceOpera">Space Opera</a> settings, as it's all too easy to classify someone nonhuman as less-than-human. In that sense it's a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>, sometimes called bioism (prejudice against non-biological consciousness or modified life). They may also succumb to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ubermensch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ubermensch">Übermensch</a> mentality that drives them to either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheSuperman">subjugate "lesser beings"</a> or to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranshumanTreachery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranshumanTreachery">forcibly convert them into beings like themselves "for their own good."</a> In some cases, the villains use radical modifications while the heroes remain more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> and "pure", leading to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">What Measure Is a Non-Human?</a>.

Instances of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim">replacing lost body parts with equivalent or improved versions</a> are not really an aversion, as the people of the society still do not seek out these enhancements (and especially so if the replacements aren't even more effective than the originals).

</p><p>Some settings <em>literally</em> do not allow transhumanism. That is to say, transhumanism is acknowledged as a real technological possibility by characters in the setting, but is explicitly forbidden by laws or customs.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em>, Jet Black has a cybernetic arm to replace his natural one, lost long ago, and Spike has an artificial and mildly enhanced eye. Aversion, right? Well, no, as Jet's considered odd for not picking up an organic one, and the cybernetic arm's made of fairly weak metal and motors. Spike doesn't seem aware of the enhancements his eye gives him, if his reaction times or accuracy with firearms are due to the eye. This is the same setting with man-portable force field generators and many, many small concealed weapons. The protagonists play this trope relatively straight, but the rest of the series tends to avert it. It deals with a variety of transhuman themes, such as uploading consciousness into computers <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (revealed as a fraud, in-universe)</span>, super soldiers, futuristic drugs, and cryonics.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CrestOfTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CrestOfTheStars">Crest of the Stars</a></em> — Abh are your garden-variety supermen constructed for space exploration, but they were constructed as <em>slaves</em>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumRebel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumRebel">rebelled against their creators</a> utterly destroying them in process. The second, antagonist faction <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">goes even further</a>, considering them just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">sentient equipment</a>. <br/><br/>But the Abh seem to avoid further experimentation themselves, and the non-Abh humans seem to have mostly deliberately avoided taking advantage of the longevity genehacks. There's been just enough transhumanism to provide space elves, and no more.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> - The protagonist has cybernetical limbs (called automail), but only go with them after losing his real limbs. His whole motivation is to get his real limbs back, even though he can do amazing things with the automail.
<ul><li> Also justified for Edward. He doesn't want to get 'cured' because of the automail being bad...he's mainly looking for a cure to use on ALPHONSE, whose soul is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedArmor">bonded to a suit of armor</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And, besides other issues, may suffer a failure of the bonding ritual at any time.</span> Alphonse however does not want to be the only one getting back what he lost though.
</li><li> In the 2003 anime, one of the Elrics lampshades this, realizing that they were only on par with some of their opponents due to their enhanced nature. The idea of someone using automail by choice instead of necessity only comes up once in the 2003 anime (when a rich man tries to buy parts from Pinako's old rival), and is treated as a completely foolish idea.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a> of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em> series with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornWinner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornWinner">superhuman</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies">Coordinators</a> and regular Naturals. The first Coordinator George Glenn was produced in secret and was only revealed when he proved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">just how superior he was to everyone else</a>. A brief period of bandwagon-jumping followed until some people began having concerns about just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">what their children were becoming</a>. (People were mainly just really jealous of the super-enhanced though.) Although Poor George Glenn paid for it with his life, and it went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">From Bad to Worse</a> to the point where the factions were at war by episode 1.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em> plays an interesting take on this. Purely artificial life is apparently not only allowed but common in the form of magic-based familiars and magic-based augments like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">ageing retardation/youth maintenance</a> are widespread. However, transhuman enhancement with genetic engineering or cybernetics is outlawed. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroidsArePeopleToo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroidsArePeopleToo">Despite the illegality, no stigma is attached to actually being either since those enhanced rarely had a choice in the matter</a>.
<ul><li> The illegality of genetic enhancement and cybernetics seems based more on the implication that the average experiment in these directions fails horribly. The subjects themselves are often actually provided therapy for dealing with such things.
</li><li> The fact that most results of the experiments double as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonofMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonofMassDestruction">Living WMDs</a> is the other main factor. There's actually a good reason for this - the roots of the technology are derived from fallen civilizations that used it to create <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldiers">Super Soldiers</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em>, more than once an aspiring scientist has tried to dabble with transhumanism, but due to all of them having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceRelatedMemeticDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceRelatedMemeticDisorder">Science-Related Memetic Disorder</a>, none of these tries ended well, as we can see in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossPlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossPlus">Macross Plus</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier">Macross Frontier</a></em>. Thus, while there's no general prohibition of transhumanism, and there are societies that actively practice it (like Macross Galaxy colony fleet in <em>Frontier</em>), it tends to be frowned upon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Vandread" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Vandread">Vandread</a></em> follows this to a degree, in that each of the different human worlds has been created/genetically altered for specific organs or traits, and whilst the main villains are robot swarms in the anime, in the manga they're human brains wired into vehicular bodies.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Cyborg009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Cyborg009">Cyborg 009</a></em>. While what was done to the cyborgs is considered evil, they do generally find their new abilities useful. The main issue they have is that they got their powers after they were kidnapped and given them against their wills. Cyborgs who willingly discard their identities as humans are portrayed as villains, as are characters who treat cyborgs as tools or machines. There's also the running theme that technology like that used to make the cyborgs should be used for the good of humanity, instead of creating weapons (as the Black Ghost had intended).
</li><li> This becomes a pivotal plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GargantiaOnTheVerdurousPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GargantiaOnTheVerdurousPlanet">Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet</a></em>.

</li><li> Some expanded universe media feature cyborgs and genetic engineering, but still it seems less prominent than the general technology level and the obvious utility of such enhancements would suggest.
</li><li> One minor example of a transhuman character in the films is Lando Calrisian's majordomo Lobot, a man with (rather clunky-looking) cybernetic brain implants. His implant basically turns him into that guy you know who's always on his mobile.

</li><li> One note though, the ARC trooper clones are indeed superhuman, given genetic enhancements at formation in addition to less genetic inhibitation on Freedom of thought allowing them to do really crazy things like leap up onto the top of an AAT that is twice as tall as they are in one jump, run up grappling lines at inhuman speeds, very casually wield gatling blasters without any trouble whereas normal clones find the things to be quite unwieldy though possible to use while standing, or strap a quadruple repeating blaster on their chest and stand without breaking their backs.

Unfortunately for him, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianityIsCatholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianityIsCatholic">Catholic/Protestant split</a> had healed by the time he succeeded, meaning a papal decree of excommunication(AKA "God Hates Freaks") held about as much weight as a <em>Presidential declaration of war.</em> The only reason it <em>didn't</em> result in a war was because the breakthrough occurred on a newly-independent space colony orbiting Jupiter. Instead, it resulted in a culture split; the fundies declared themselves "Adamists", named for the biblical Adam, who was "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">Pure</a>". The augmented declared themselves "Edenists", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultBackfire">mocking their opponents</a>. Edenists then developed "bitek" to incredible levels; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganicTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganicTechnology">Organic Technology</a> is commonplace, and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShip">Living Ships</a> outperform baseline vessels easily. Even their <em>space stations</em> are organic and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci">sentient</a></em>. To keep from being left behind, the Adamists were forced to develop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines">nanotechnology</a> to keep up, resulting in equally prevalent cybernetics. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldiers</a> are common, often bearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmCannon">modular arms with gun attachments</a> and extra forearms for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">More Dakka</a>, and even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg">totally bionic bodies</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyCostume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyCostume">with crazy-ass ceramic-gel skin</a></em>.

The implication is that transhumanism is inevitable.
</li><li> Note that, despite the above, by the year 2600 the two societies coexist peacefully: Adamists are the vast majority, but Edenists use their bitek to harvest fusion fuel from jovian planets and stabilize the economy. Also, with one exception, most Edenists rely on bitek space habitats, while Adamists colonize planets. Neither of them can survive on their own (and the Edenist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Consensus</a> makes this clear when the issue is brought up).
</li><li> Also note that bitek has its limitations: it can outperform "solid-state" technologies by a fair margin, but bitek constructs have a limited lifespan (less than 50 years for starships) and are generally harder and more expensive to create; biocomputers also generally become sentient the moment they're switched on, leading to some ethical issues at one point with one that was essentially created to be killed. Also, on the issue of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading">Brain Uploading</a>: this is a universe where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent">soul</a>, in its religious sense, <em>is a real thing</em>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Kiint</a> reveal that Edenist uploads are not "real" souls, but copies running inside sentient bio-computers, simply adding their experience and personality to the computer's own soul. All Edenists who ever died, died as much as everyone else. This results in some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a> for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">G7, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy">Ancient Conspiracy</a> that rules Earth; back in the late 21st century, they attempted to ban transhumanism via religious persecution, as they were secretly using bitek make themselves immortal via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningGambit">copying their minds into clones</a>. There are thus dozens of copies of each of these megalomaniacs in the Beyond, who come back as the Possessed and raise all kinds of hell.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLeagueOfPeoplesVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLeagueOfPeoplesVerse">The League of Peoples Verse</a></em>, the technology for cyborging exists, but the League explicitly disapproves of it. Genetic engineering is also illegal in the human Technocracy, as it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">goes horribly wrong</a> more often than it succeeds. Genetic engineering is only widely used by alien species, such as the Divians and Cashlings.
</li><li> In "The Waves Stifle the Wind" by the Strugatski brothers, a small group of humans (about one in 100000) begin to evolve biologically, and it is assumed as truth by all sides that those "Ludens" must leave Earth, as otherwise the human society would be destroyed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> in the end, they leave</span>.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesStross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesStross">Charles Stross</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Accelerando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Accelerando">Accelerando</a></em>, the things that humans and the artificial intelligences they spawn turn into are effectively transhumans; they do not communicate with the remnant of humanity in any direct way because their minds are so totally alien in structure and function. Having your mind adjusted to cope with their fiendishly complex economic system they use is effectively a one-way trip and results in you losing your humanity. <br/><br/>It is interesting to note that the transhuman intelligences bear the rest of humanity no ill-will, or even any passing interest: "normal" intelligences simply cannot provide any threat or anything of interest and are more or less entirely beneath their notice. One interesting ability one weakly godlike intelligence gains is the ability to create a perfect software model of a human intelligence and run it though a "Turing oracle" to exhaustively calculate every possible response the human might have in a situation. It would be literally impossible to out-think such a being without upgrading your own intelligence, <em>and it would already know that you'd try to do that</em>. <br/><br/>Another Stross book, <em>Glass House</em> does not have any strongly superhuman minds presented in the story but implies that they could exist. The protagonist decides that worrying about superhuman intelligences is futile, because if any were involved there would be simply no hope of defeating their plans.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> series plays with this in an interesting way. While the 'Good' guys at Beowulf have created a process that allows for life-spans of over three centuries and are working on improvements, replacement grown limbs are common, and those few who can't use them due to genetic instabilities can get cybernetic limbs with no real stigma or issues, and in the case of a planet called Sharpton, are actually a cultural icon, they are insistent that this is not self-enhancement so much as bringing out the genome's full potential. Actually improving on the body using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticEngineeringIsTheNewNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticEngineeringIsTheNewNuke">Genetic Engineering</a>, on the other hand, is widely stigmatised thanks to the damage done to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthThatUsedToBeBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthThatUsedToBeBetter">Old Earth</a> in its Final War, partly due to eugenic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldiers</a>, and those who are outright gene-modded or descended from such try to keep quiet about it. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">real bad guys</a> of the setting (though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says they are just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> who have a very good point) are renegade Beowulfians who have been actively enhancing the gene pool of their key members for centuries.
<ul><li> The other part of the issue is that the one place that is openly doing genetic modification (Mesa) is using it to create slaves which just ends up reinforcing the stigma against genetic modification for most people.
</li><li> Later novels reveal that a core point of the logic behind the Beowulf code was that the last thing humanity needed was a self-styled master race that genuinely was superior to everyone else in some quantifiable manner.
</li></ul></li><li> In the novelisation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a>, mention is made of the world having got over issues of mere drug-enhanced athletes in the Olympics and professional sports only to be faced by the problems posed by genetic and biological modification - Olympic sprinters who are all legs with only a vestigial upper body, for instance, and professional footballers with vestigial heads (un-necessary for the game of soccer) whose brains are minimal and literally in their feet. This is resolved by making professional sport leagues for genetically modified players, thus driving the old boring natural sort into extinction. People cheer professional boxers who can pummel each other for days on end, or pro soccer teams made up of genetically modified players. The text notes that Scotland fields a goalkeeper who is a massive rectangle of flesh who in theory can block the entire goal - <em>yet Scotland still fails to qualify for the World Cup</em>.
</li><li> Discussed frequently in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlastairReynolds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlastairReynolds">Alastair Reynolds</a>' works:
<ul><li> In <em>Century Rain</em> following a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanotech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanotech">Nanotech</a> disaster the surviving humans split into two factions: the "Slashers" who said "What's done is done, no use crying over spilt milk" and embrace all possible technology, including genetic modifications and implants, and the "Threshers", who will only use tech which is essential for survival. They leave their own bodies alone.
</li><li> Initially averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RevelationSpaceSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RevelationSpaceSeries">Revelation Space Series</a></em>. Humanity was enjoying a golden age of prosperity and science, with brain augments, body modification and effective immortality being common on worlds like Yellowstone. Then the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyGoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyGoo">Melding Plague</a> showed up, corrupting any nanotech based technology it touched; anyone with brain augments or high-end cybernetics would die a violent, painful and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode">gory death</a>. By the time <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RevelationSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RevelationSpace">Revelation Space</a></em> takes place, the only major transhuman populations left are the Ultranauts, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyborgHelmsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyborgHelmsman">the crew</a> of the lighthuggers that make interstellar travel possible, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a> Conjoiners, who remained isolated and learned how to fight off the Melding Plague.
</li><li> Enforced in <em>Merlin's Gun</em> and <em>Minla's Flowers</em>; with humanity fighting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessWar">Hopeless War</a> waged over millenia, the technological base needed to sustain most high-tech augments is destroyed. However, when Merlin who has been alive but in exile <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss">for centuries</a> restores contact with humanity, he finds that while their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">physical, hardware-based technology has regressed</a> to being far inferior to his, their <em>software</em> is more advanced, with every person having their own cybernetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritAdvisor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritAdvisor">Spirit Advisor</a> that can effortless crack through his starship's encryption.

</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNexusSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNexusSeries">The Nexus Series</a>, The United States and Europe have adopted stringent laws against augmentation of the human body, including genetic augmentation and the use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainComputerInterface" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainComputerInterface">"drugs" like the titular Nexus</a>. Things are a bit more liberal in the east however.
</li><li> Zig-zagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OracleOfTao" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OracleOfTao">Oracle of Tao</a></em>. It turns out that the shapeshifting hengeyokai were a result of genetic experiments. One of these, the lizard people, is behind secret governments and many wars (especially nuclear wars). Since the Council is against sketchy shadow governments running things, the idea of accidentally creating hybrids is out (though "tweaks" are allowed). The Council is also not fond of cyborgs, due probably to a combination of hacking and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZerothLawRebellion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZerothLawRebellion">Zeroth Law Rebellion</a>.
</li><li> Largely averted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SergeyLukyanenko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SergeyLukyanenko">Sergey Lukyanenko</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Genome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Genome">Genome</a></em>, where a large percentage of humans have been modified by in utero gene therapy to a pre-selected Specification. During puberty, the Specs undergo a metamorphosis during which their bodies and minds change to better suit their future career. This is considered normal, although the Naturals (who only undergo the very basic gene therapy to correct common birth defects) tend not to like Specs much, which is reciprocated by the Specs. Interestingly, in his foreword, the author is the one who expresses this trope's views by pointing out that this effectively keeps people confined to their roles without the possibility of any mobility. In Lukyanekno's opinion, this is already happening, to an extent, without any genetic modifications. Rich people's children get better care and education than poor people's children and frequently end up in the same careers are their parents.
</li><li> Early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheColorOfDistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheColorOfDistance">The Color of Distance</a></em> the alien Tendu help a stranded human to survive on their world by giving her their color-changing skin, claws, senses, and her own set of spurs, which she gradually learns to use to examine organ function, heal, and synthesize things with. She grows to appreciate this but worries that she won't be able to change back when she's with her own kind again, and in fact asks them to do so, though she keeps slightly enhanced senses and reflexes. In the second book she doesn't seem to miss her alien enhancements at all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuantumThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuantumThief">The Quantum Thief</a></em>-trilogy averts this trope in every way possible, but also goes its way to subvert it, exploring just how difficult it would be to retain a traditional human society in the midst of transhuman technologies. In the first novel there is the Oubliette colony, which tries to preserve everything that was good about the original society, but to reach this end all the citizens are permanently connected to the colony-wide Exomemory, and own total encryption rights over their own portion of it. Only the extreme degree of multi-layered memory encryption prevents the Sobornost mind upload collective from simply swooping in and forcefully uploading the entire population in accordance to their Great Common Task, but it also means that, in essence, the Oubliette is in fact a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a> that hallucinates being a human society, as if the encryptions were to be removed, everybody would share all their thoughts and memories.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AncillaryJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AncillaryJustice">Ancillary Justice</a></em>, the Radachaai consider people with cybernetics past a certain level to not be human (and thus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">not be people</a>). It is implied that most other places have similar views on transhumanism, though some small societies embrace it to the point of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranshumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranshumanAliens">practically unrecognizable as human</a> and consider it odd that others don't do the same.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertHeinlein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertHeinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>'s future history zigzags this. The Howard families are arguably transhuman, being genetically selected for longevity (and later for intelligence and physical fitness), but cyborgs are treated as a mockery of humanity.
<ul><li> To be fair to Heinlein regarding the cyborg issue, the word "cyborg" is usually used in his novels specifically to mean a human with part of their brain replaced with a computer (C.f. <em>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress,</em> which mentions cyborg pilots who interface directly with their ships.) Predictably, these cyborgs are somewhat <em>off,</em> due to not having a full human brain.
</li></ul></li><li> Official policy for the alien Jan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlienInASmallTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlienInASmallTown">Alien in a Small Town</a>.</em> Not so for their cybernetic rivals the Arachne. Humanity apparently suffered at least one war over the issue, and public attitudes have gone back and forth, but there are now multiple genetically engineered subraces of humanity living alongside mainstream humans, and even "normal" humans typically have some genetically modified ancestors.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JourneyToChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JourneyToChaos">Journey to Chaos</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">Bladicraft</a> can transform a human into a humanoid mana breed known as a "bladi". This gives them their own bladicraft in addition to greater physical durability and tenacity. Despite these benefits, the Bladi Clan has only propagated through the old fashioned way because the clan itself considers Bladi Conversion to be the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkArts">Dark Arts</a>. The transformation is painful, the survival rate is low, and the clan's orthodoxy states that simply sharing their blood would not make the newcomer their family member. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LoomingShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LoomingShadow">Looming Shadow</a></em>, Ataidar's Royal Mage requested Basilard Bladi's assistance in using Bladi Conversion as part of a cure for Mana Mutation and he was outright refused. The last person who tried this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson">unpersoned</a> and the bladi they created is considerd an abomination.
</li><li> Machine Man by Max Barry centers around a character who gets in an industrial accident and loses a limb. He designs his own prosthetic, which he deems to be better than the organic limb, and decides to start replacing all of his limbs, one by one. Naturally, society as a whole can't handle this, and the central conflict of the book is between his desire to slowly replace himself with better parts and societal attempts to stop what is viewed as a self-harm behavior.
</li><li> The short story "Segregationist" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a> discusses this trope from a body-replacement perspective. The story centers around a doctor who disapproves of a growing trend for humans to seek prosthetics that make them more robotic and robots seeking prosthetics that make them more human. He says that he considers transhumanism not as a desire to improve one's self, but as a rejection of one's natural state, and states that if he ever needs parts of his body replaced, he'll seek replacements as close to the originals as possible. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It is only in the last paragraph that it is revealed that the doctor is a robot</span>.

Baptism is a surgical procedure that grants quasi-supernatural abilities but is extremely dangerous to the patient (even a partial version has a mortality rate of 80%). Elixir is a drug that heals injuries and gives various improvements, originally used by the Lords to become superior to their subjects. However, making full use of Elixir requires one to first undergo Baptism, a high dose will transform the user into a Nocturnal<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1mlf7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1mlf7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1mlf7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">a monster with incredible power and amplified negative emotions, causing them to be a danger to everyone around them, and which is likely to soon run out of life force and die</span>, and making Elixir requires <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the life energy of human beings</span>, all reasons why the main characters are reluctant to use it. Finally, there's the creation of part-Abyss, which makes the aforementioned Baptism look safe; exactly <em>one</em> person has survived this. Said person has superhuman strength, regeneration and senses, and can increase these further by tapping into their Abyss side (but with risks like being controlled by others). It's noted that if their true nature were to become public, they would almost certainly be executed (as normal Abyss are mindlessly-violent monsters), so their friends are trying to find a way to reverse this.

They only become a problem when they decide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwillingRoboticisation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwillingRoboticisation">everyone else wants to be a Cyberman too</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The bad:
<ul><li> The Daleks are the modified Kaled mutant, placed in a travel machine. Cyborg, genetically engineered genocidal monstrosities.

His main problem with it is that Lazarus is running away from death and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever">states that living forever just makes you old and tired as everything dies around you</a>. Since he's at least 900 at this point (though going by the Classic series, he might be closer to 1500), he knows whereof he speaks.

There is a specific example of this: at one point Barclay has the Holodeck run a program which enables him to interact with a virtual Albert Einstein and discuss entirely new ideas. If the holodeck is capable of simulating Einstein's intellect in such a fashion, it would imply that the computer running it is at least as smart as Einstein and should be capable of making new discoveries on its own. This, of course, never happens. Well, except that whole Moriarty business. Which apparently required a significant portion of the Enterprise's processing power.

</li><li> In one episode, Ensign Barclay is raised to literally godlike superintelligence by an alien probe. He starts out by using it to indulge various personal desires and do his job with superhuman efficiency, then goes off on a power trip to where he hijacks the Enterprise and takes it to meet some nigh-omnipotent aliens — the probe makers — who revert him to normal human intelligence. But at no time throughout his several days of apotheosis does it occur to him to devote <em>one minute</em> to studying his own augmented brain, how it got that way, and how he could possibly reproduce the phenomenon in others. As it is eventually revealed that his intelligence was given by the probe for a very specific reason it could be argued that the probe's "gift" has strings attached to keep the recipient from duplicating the effect, but that is never addressed (or even questioned) during the episode.

</li><li> Another episode features a character suffering progressive brain damage, and having their brain supplemented with computer implants. Once their organic brain is almost completely destroyed, the doctor just lets the character die because nobody sees any point in keeping them alive, despite the fact that in-universe the character is still a sapient, sentient being with all of his original memories. However, the character in question didn't feel like himself with the implants and wasn't really interested in living a shadow life, believing that if the last part of his cerebrum were artificially replaced (even with his memories intact via the positronic implants) the result would simply be an android copy of him rather than actually <em>him</em>. It was made very plain that to keep Bareil alive past that point would leave him with, at best, a drastically altered and emotionally stunted personality — and there would be more such surgeries to come as still more of his central nervous system failed, so that in the long run he would likely wind up as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAMachine">Just a Machine</a>.

A subtle flaw in their enhanced neurology also created increased aggression. An ironic aspect of all of this is that the Augments really were not ridiculously powerful.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery">Star Trek: Discovery</a></em> touches on the genetic augmentation taboo, as it turns out the only way to get the Spore drive to work without basically torturing an innocent alien is to use Augment technology to create a human who can run the drive. This turns out to be a Big Problem because of Federation laws against genetic augmentation (see the whole Khan thing for why), and puts said augmented crewmember and those who helped him into an ethical dilemma as they try to keep their actions secret from both the authorities and the crewmember's spouse.

To do so they'll need millions if not billions of the souls that power the Eldar Wraith machines — and while in the wraith machines the souls are trapped inside crystals that are very fragile. In addition, while inside the Wraith machines the Eldar are basically being kept away from their afterlife AND are trapped in a half-awake hell. There's a reason the Eldar are loath to use them.
</li><li> Also, the Imperium does have AIs, but they have to be connected to a human, (e.g. the Titans, which are controlled by a human pilot, or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan">Servitors</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanResources" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanResources">which actually used to be human</a>). What exactly is and isn't allowed with regard to AIs seems to vary wildly between the branches of the Adeptus Mechanicus, the Imperial Clergy and the game designers. Every machine is expected to have a machine spirit which can be placated by offerings and prayer and some machine spirits are certainly more than superstition (advanced tanks like the Land Raider have at least an expert system), yet strong AI is definitely out of the question. Although, if the comic Damnation is to be believed, even a simple bolt pistol's Machine Spirit is intelligent enough to worry about whether it has failed its "master".
</li><li> The Eldar do have cybernetic implants, they're just not especially prevalent in modern versions. In second and third editions, every other eldar seemed to have some kind of plate in his head or an enhanced limb, they sometimes still use these older art pieces too. They also seem to fuse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas">crystals</a> to their heads to enhance and protect their minds (not to be confused with waystones, which capture their souls should they die, and are on the chest) a lot even in modern depictions, though. While regular Eldar don't have many transhumanists (-eldarists?), the Dark Eldar are perfectly happy to augment their bodies. Most of them prefer to retain their appearance due to vanity, although they may be heavily augmented under their skin (there's at least one Succubus that has replaced all of her muscles with cybernetic ones to enhance her strength and reaction time). The Haemonculi themselves don't care about appearances so they tend to have things like extra arms and surgery tools grafted onto their bodies.
</li><li> The human Cult Mechanicus is strongly based upon transcending the frailties of the flesh, mostly by replacing it with machine parts. They're generally regarded as weird, but accepted as the second religion in the Imperium because they're the only ones who understand the technology that it depends on. Some of them choose to undergo the Rite of Pure Thought, which involves replacing the parts of their brains responsible for emotion with computing gear. This leaves them utterly unemotional and rational and is considered an extreme measure even among the Mechanicus mainstream.
</li><li> The Adeptus Mechanicus try to replace as much organic matter as possible with machinery. There are two specific Adepts - in <em>Eisenhorn</em> and <em>Storm of Iron</em> respectively. The former is reduced to a brain in a mechanical body, and the latter is a <em>brain and a face</em> hooked up to a <em>vast</em> databank. Would count as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">And I Must Scream</a> if said Adept didn't seem to actually <em>prefer</em> this state of affairs. In the new Rogue Trader rulebook it is shown that unobtrusive bionics do exist, but are frowned upon by the Adeptus Mechanicus who view overt and baroque augmentation as a mark of honour.
</li><li> Also in Eisenhorn is the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> villain</span> Pontinus Glaw, basically a box with psychic powers. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> later a robotic body is built for him as an act of mercy by Eisenhorn. Whoops!</span>
</li><li> The Space Marines in general arguably count under transhumanism since their genetic and surgical modifications put them far, far, far beyond the abilities of normal humans. They are impossibly strong, with bulletproof bones, quickly clot should they become injured, have heightened senses, require less sleep and turn off parts of their brain to continue being awake, and may very well be capable of living forever if the violence of their universe didn't make a violent death so likely... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">among</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSoulIsMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSoulIsMine">other</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">things</a>. However, they only allow certain very badass children and adolescents to become Space Marines, as the modifications must start being implanted during puberty. And a large quantity of said badass children will likely die at the hands of their fellow hopefuls so as to have only those ones who are worthy become a Space Marine.
</li><li> The Iron Hands Chapter of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines">Space Marines</a>: their whole schtick is the weakness of the flesh and the strength of the machine. Before becoming a full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Space Marine</a>, the iniate must have his right hand replaced with a cybernetic equivalent, and from that point on the Chapter's Marines gleefully replace their flesh as much as they possibly can, viewing injuries as a <em>good thing</em> because it gives them an excuse to get the bodypart replaced with a machine equivalent.
</li><li> The Iron Warriors are basically the Chaos Marine equivalent of the Iron Hands. Not only do they suffer degenerations in their geneseed that cause them to suffer crippling deformities or unviable mutations in their limbs, necessitating bionic replacements, but they willingly infect themselves with the Obliterator Virus. Which basically turns them into a shapeshifting morass of organic meat and metal.
</li><li> The various citizenry of the Imperium don't have much longer life expectancies than modern-day humans (and, if you're born on a feral world or death world, much much less) but a few of the imperial aristocracy can gain access to bionics and surgeries to extend their lives. Commissar Yarrick has been alive for over 400 years through a combination of life-rejuvenation and bionics, and Colonel "Iron Hand" Strakken has half his body replaced with bionics.
</li><li> Eversor Assassins are designed to be walking one-man gorefest. However, they are not genetically modified like the Space Marines. They instead use a combination of bionics and a really wild cocktail of combat drugs to increase their killing power. The side effects of these drugs is that their bodies will explode on death, and they are in a permanent drug-induced rage, necessitating the operatives be sedated and transported in stasis between assignments. The other assassin temples rarely resort of such extremes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">instead opting to train the crap out of their skills</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EclipsePhase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EclipsePhase">Eclipse Phase</a></em>, this trope is played straight and justified with the Bioconservative factions, most notably the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">Jovian Republic</a>, and otherwise gleefully averted - even with a cultural preference for basically human bodies, the vast majority of the system's population prefer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf">sleeve</a> into genetically enhanced Splicer morphs.
</li><li> Likewise in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TranshumanSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TranshumanSpace">Transhuman Space</a></em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em> setting, many transhumanist technologies exist, but some are banned by particular societies.
</li><li> Transhumanism is almost totally absent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller">Traveller</a></em>. It is justified by technological stasis/regress and social stigma.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em>. Many, <em>many</em> people have some degree of mechanical alteration - the datajack is the most common bit of cyberware in the world. However, a number of people consider cybernetic modification to be a bad idea, and it's not just the mages. (While altering your body screws up your Essence, tied to a mage's power, even some non-magical people find the whole idea of cyberware to be creepy.) Though this depends on the edition. Fourth edition is much more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostCyberpunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostCyberpunk">Post-Cyberpunk</a> and most people have at least some. Not the magic uses though; cyberware still messes up magic.
</li><li> By the era of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia">Paranoia</a></em> — which may be anywhere from a hundred to <em>thousands</em> of years in the future — humanity basically only still exists because The Computer's directives say it must. Those who show transhuman tendencies and evolutionary advancement are branded "mutants" and enslaved or exterminated. The status quo is all.
</li><li> In <em>Nova Praxis</em>, the Humanity Preservation Act restricts how transhuman Coalition citizens are allowed to be. Everyone has minor boosts (the average lifespan is about 250 years barring accidents), but more than a 0.0035% divergence from the "acceptable" human genetic code is against the law, and SIM environments have to run on the same clock as the real world. The "Purist" movement that supports the HPA has a majority share of the population, and four of the six Houses endorse it - but House Dalianis will back anyone who can get the job done, regardless of whether or not one is a baseline human, House Tsarya is moving away from strict bioconservatism in favour of neutrality, and the Purist dominance is a matter of only a 53% share, which means transhumanism could become much more legal in a decade or so.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>, there was very little transhumanism prior to the Clan Invasion bar the rare and fantastically expensive replacement limb. Justified, as known space was involved or recovering from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">300 years of total warfare</a> and the subsequent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">loss of infrastructure and technology</a>. However, when the Clans invaded, they did so using test tube warriors born in iron wombs, often sporting bionic replacements for limbs lost in battle, in addition to a small percentage using a direct <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainComputerInterface" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainComputerInterface">BrainComputer Interface</a> for controlling their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a>. Fully averted by the time of the Jihad, where the Word of Blake uses heavily augmented super-soldiers and all the major powers use augmented agents in their intelligence agencies.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series contains very small man-portable force field generators, amazing metallurgy, and an entire species of intelligent humanoid robots. Cybernetic technology, however, is much less pronounced, primarily consisting of biotic implants and small-scale surgical implants of translators, haptic display manipulators, and other small tools. The game does repeatedly mention that genetic enhancement is very common, to the point where every human soldier has been upgraded, presumably including the main character. However, strict restrictions apply in that you can upgrade a species' existing abilities, such as strength and speed, but adding anything completely new, such as extra arms or acid spit, is illegal in Systems Alliance space. Even research into creating entirely new organisms is now illegal. Medi-gel was created by human genetic experimentation and is technically illegal, but it's so damn useful that the Citadel's made an exemption.
</li><li> In the third game EDI riffs on the notion that Shepard might be considered Transhuman and the legal ramifications of this, causing Shepard to become highly concerned. EDI then emphatically states that Shepard is <em>not</em> a Transhuman due to still having an organic mind. Of course, it should be noted that we later learn that she's capable of lying to spare the feelings of others, so its entirely possible that Shepard actually <em>is</em> a Transhuman.
</li><li> According to Sovereign, the Mass Effect technology is left around so that the species who discover it will develop along those technological lines, and since they are never left around long enough to truly understand the complex technology in any way but reverse engineering it, they never develop any radical modifications.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>, Miranda states that she's had so many genetic modifications that she's superior in every way to baseline humans. Grunt is synthesized from different Krogan strains to be perfect, and the sterilization of the Krogans was certainly a frightening indication of how advanced technology is. Garrus has some cyborg replacements, but as it is shown with Shepard, all of this is incredibly expensive even for a monstrously wealthy, shadowy corporation.
</li><li> Joker, on the other hand, has a rare genetic disorder that no one understands, so it would probably be a significant undertaking to correct his disease, and he would probably resent the offer. It's worth noting that he mentions occasionally having to use crutches in the first game, but is shown getting around reasonably fine in the second and third. Apparently the technological boom after the destruction of Sovereign gave rise to better medical technology and treatment of individuals with brittle bone disease. Genetic engineering also has progressed to the point where Mordin could potentially cure his condition... at least, if he could figure out how to prevent the cure from also shutting down his liver at the same time.
</li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>, one of the endings could be more or less described as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Transhumanism For Everyone</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The villains of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Oni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Oni">Oni</a></em> take a rare example of entirely xenobiological modification, although they're more villainous because they want to force humanity to upgrade, rather than because they are upgraded. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The heroine is revealed to have been upgraded in this manner far in the past</span>. Bungie likes averting this trope. Of course, it's also a setting where neurally linked androids are used to replace a simple monitoring system, but normal human soldiers with unimpressive body armor are used to fight said biologically enhanced superhumans.
</li><li> The backstory of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starcraft">Starcraft</a></em> describes how the tyrannical United Powers League arrested all cyborgs, mutants, cyberpunks and other such "undesirables" from Earth at one point and threw them in jail to "purify" the population. Granted, for the most part these <em>weren't</em> nice people or innocent victims, which is why the Koprulu Sector (where many of them got deported as a kickstarter for deep space colonization) is so full of back-stabbing, treacherous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters">Terran bastards</a>. It's also implied that this is the reason why they <em>survived at all</em>.
</li><li> Explored in the CD-i game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MutantRampageBodySlam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MutantRampageBodySlam">Mutant Rampage Body Slam</a></em>, in which there are very few pure humans left, and genetically-enhanced mutants and cyborgs are the norm. The heroes are The Naturals, a team of pure humans competing in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodSport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodSport">Blood Sport</a> against all the evil mutants and cyborgs. It's a very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad">anti-scientific</a> game.
</li><li> The whole reason why the Advent were banished in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SinsOfASolarEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SinsOfASolarEmpire">Sins of a Solar Empire</a></em> was because the Traders viewed transhuman practices as abhorrent perversions.
</li><li> Averted and played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetsOfRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetsOfRage">Streets of Rage</a> 3</em> of all things. New hero character Zan is a huge cyborg with only his human head remaining and nobody bats an eye despite the series not previously dealing with any heavy sci-fi concepts. Played straight in that Mr. X is now a brain in a jar that works through multiple robot bodies... but he was evil to begin with, so it could be argued as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a> and another aversion.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersAlphaCentauri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersAlphaCentauri">Sid Meiers Alpha Centauri</a></em>, where transhumanism is <em>inevitable</em> in the higher stages of technological development. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading">Brain Uploading</a> is commonplace by the endgame, and the ultimate objective of all the factions is to complete the "Ascent to Transcendence" and use the planet's own neural network to survive its final transformation into a godlike sentience.
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a>, the Manifold Caretakers are specifically <em>against</em> this ending and will fight anyone who strives for it. However, this stems from the last time someone tried to do this, resulting in the destruction of their home system. Here are the defining quotes of the Caretaker leader and her counterpart among the Manifold Usurpers:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> "Tau Ceti flowering: Horrors visited upon neighboring systems must never be repeated. Therefore: if it means the end of our evolution as a species, so be it." — Caretaker Lular H'minee, "Sacrifice : Life"
</div><div class="indent"> "Risks of Flowering: considerable. But rewards of godhood: who can measure?" — Usurper Judaa Marr, "Courage : To Question"
</div><ul><li> Played straight and averted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CivilizationBeyondEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CivilizationBeyondEarth">Civilization: Beyond Earth</a></em>, where two of the "Affinities" (basically, guiding philosophies) involve the two primary means of improving humanity: bio-modification (Harmony) and cybernetics (Supremacy). The third Affinity called Purity is vehemently opposed to any sort of transhumanism (although they still use basic gene therapy to eliminate genetic defects and certain diseases), preferring to build heave defenses and use big guns against the other two. In fact, of the three, the Purity Affinity is the one that advocates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Terraforming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Terraforming">terraforming</a>, while Harmony and Supremacy are focused on modifying humans to survive on the planet. The Harmony victory is identical to the Ascent to Transcendence victory in <em>Alpha Centauri</em>. The Supremacy victory, meanwhile, involves conquering <em>Earth</em> and forcing all humans everywhere to accept cybernetics. The Purity victory has the anti-transhumanists call in settlers from Earth (and frequently crush the others to make room). That said, even Harmony and Supremacy have limits; they join Purity in viewing the Harmony-Supremacy hybrid affinity introduced in <em>Rising Tide</em>, which combines both biological and mechanical augmentation so as to change mankind to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranshumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranshumanAliens">levels beyond both</a>, as abhorrent.
</li></ul></li><li> Semi-averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fracture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fracture">Fracture</a>.</em> The war between the Atlantic Alliance and the Republic of Pacfica starts over what <em>kind</em> of transhumanism is allowed. Specifically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance">The Alliance</a> supports cyborgnetics and opposes genetic engineering, passes a law that states persons genetically modified over a certain percentage are no longer human and are to subsequently lose their legal rights and causes Pacfica to secede.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris">Stellaris</a></em> has a few factions that disapprove of certain forms of transhumanism:
<ul><li> Xenophobes disapprove of genetic modification, seeing modded subspecies as "impure".
</li><li> Egalitarians don't like the idea of using eugenics or "capacity boosters" to improve the empire's leadership, but they don't have a problem with genetic modification of the whole population.
</li><li> Spiritualists consider <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading">Brain Uploading</a> to be an elaborate form of suicide and the very existence of artificial intelligence to be anathema.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em>: The New Loka syndicate wants to return humanity to a "pure" existence, without any artificial changes or enhancements. The problem is that basically the entire human race has been heavily modified, and they've been like that for a very long time. The Grineer are a clone army that uses cybernetics to make up for their failing genetics, the Corpus also use heavy cybernetics and roboticization, and even nature itself has either been directly modified or evolved to adapt to the technological ruins that litter the system; "primitive" tribes of humans make use of ancient synthetic meat vats and half-cybernetic fish as a matter of course. And that's not getting into the Tenno, who were considered abominations twice over even by the transhumanists who created them. In the end, it's never specified exactly <em>what</em> New Loka expects to "return" to, but they seem to define all their enemies as "impure", and only themselves as "pure".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Rimworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Rimworld">Rimworld</a></em>, characters with the Body Purist trait believe in this. They believe that their bodies shouldn't be augmented and will suffer a major mood penalty if forced to receive any kind of artificial replacement for a body part outside of a transplant of a normal organic body part. This can get problematic if they lose a limb due to combat or disease, as even a basic wooden prosthetic will anger them, and thus leave you stuck between choosing an angry but functional colonist or a happy but crippled one.

Such magic includes the ability to shape-shift people into forms they'd prefer or even for medical reasons. Mori was exiled from Thoria as a child because of a genetic modification she needed to digest food. Since these are now standard practice in the rest of the world this trope is averted in their case.

On one occasion later in the series, something happens that causes him to lose his powers, so naturally he and his friends go back to the lab so he can repeat the process that gave him his powers. By doing so, he successfully gains them back, apparently showing the process is completely repeatable, not a fluke. However, none of Danny's team seem to consider repeating the process on anyone else. Not even on themselves, even though it would obviously make fighting ghosts easier.
<ul><li> Could potentially be justified in that not everyone's biology is exactly the same. All they know is that it worked under those conditions for Danny.

Maybe 99 out of 100 people would simply die from being exposed to it, and Danny just had very lucky DNA. But even if that's what stopped them from doing it, one might expect them to at least <em>discuss</em> the possibility.
