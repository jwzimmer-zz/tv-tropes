</p><p>The reasons behind this vary — sometimes the opponent is literally fueled by the hero's aggressive energy (or is a literal figment of the hero's imagination) so putting a stop to their hostility the enemy will literally weaken (and/or cease to exist). Maybe the opponent has an overdeveloped sense of honor and refuses to strike down someone who won't keep their weapon in hand. Or perhaps the confrontation was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsYouAndHimFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsYouAndHimFight">just a big misunderstanding</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">Poor Communication Kills</a>, you know) and standing down will buy time for both sides to figure out that they shouldn't even be fighting each other in the first place. (Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover">Crossover</a> stories are prone to this, with the heroes from each series somehow finding themselves in the others' crosshairs.) Overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillMeNowOrForeverStayYourHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillMeNowOrForeverStayYourHand">Kill Me Now, or Forever Stay Your Hand</a>, where Luka confronts an aggressive Alice with nonaggression and hopes to win by getting her to stand down too.

</p><p>When this is applied to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGames">Video Games</a>, it tends to mix elements of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless Boss Fight</a> (because, more often than not, the opponent is made literally invincible to all attacks), a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaitingPuzzle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaitingPuzzle">Waiting Puzzle</a> and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine">Hold the Line</a> objective (because if the party dies, it's still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a>).

Also note that depending on whether the game proceeds in real-time or in turns, sometimes simply <em>waiting</em> is not enough, and the player needs to take some kind of non-hostile action (e.g. the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefendCommand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefendCommand">Defend Command</a>) to make time pass.

Come at them all aggressive-like and they'll tear you a new one (unless you're just badass enough to take them on). Throw down your sword and make with the peacefulness, and they'll get bored and wander off.
</li><li> Used in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BraveStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BraveStory">Brave Story</a></em> movie during the climactic battle against their respective doppelgangers. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The hero Wataru ends up winning the fight by accepting that his shadow is a part of himself, all the parts of himself that he was afraid to acknowledge. The anti-hero Mitsuru wins the fight by stabbing his shadow through the chest... and you guessed it, dies of a self-inflicted stab wound.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> did pretty much the same thing against his inner darkness, and even acknowledges that it actually <em>helped</em> him in some points of his life.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> has this during the S Class trial arc. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">Natsu</a> has to fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor">Gildarts</a> in order to advance. After putting up a good fight, Gildarts says that Natsu is just missing one critical element to pass... and then he stops holding back his power. Natsu is so scared that he falls to his knees and admits defeat, which is exactly what Gildarts was hoping for.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MysteriousGirlfriendX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MysteriousGirlfriendX">Mysterious Girlfriend X</a></em>: Best option to use against panty scissors, unless you have your own special attack.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> Ichigo enters some last-minute training with Zangetsu before his final battle with Aizen. Zangetsu explains that he won't simply tell Ichigo the ultimate technique of his power and proceeds to fight him. After a bit of swordplay that doesn't seem to go anywhere, Ichigo figures out he won't learn the secret by pure force by fighting, but, rather, by letting Zangetsu stab him. This is exactly what the spirit wanted and gives Ichigo his power for the final confrontation. To be noted is how Zangetsu's second purpose was to get Ichigo to accept his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a> as part of him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em>, Kenshin has to fight one of Shishio's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mooks</a> in front of his archenemy. Not wanting to reveal any of his techniques, he wins the battle... by running away from him until the guy breaks his leg from chasing after him. But it's then subverted when Kenshin is forced to reveal one of his techniques to save the mook himself from Shishio.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UmiMonogatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UmiMonogatari">Umi Monogatari</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, Sedna, is a force of darkness that has corrupted the island and will consume both land and sea. Marin and Kanon are told throughout the series that they must seal her away with the Spear of Light, and to not hesitate to defeat Sedna even if it means attacking their friends. However, when they find out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sedna is really the islanders' combined sorrow</span>, they <em>accept</em> the darkness within their hearts and deal with it rather than throwing it away.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill">Kill la Kill</a></em>, Ryuko attempted this against Gamagoori, who gets stronger when struck, but it fails because he simply whips himself to get the strength he needs, and she's forced to find another way to beat him.
<ul><li> Another example in a previous episode when Mako's family is given better living conditions when Ryuko and her try to play by the Academy's rules by starting their own club. However, the richer lifestyle changes the family for the worst which Ryuko notices and quits the club. Satsuki gives Mako a two-star Goku uniform and has her fight Ryuko if she wants to keep her lifestyle. After a bit of fighting, Ryuko purposely de-powers, refusing to fight further and just lets Mako wail on her. This goes on till sunset till it looks like Mako is going to finish her. Mako stops short of the final blow and realizes her greed, calling out her own family for not trying to stop her. This of course was Ryuko's plan all along to get her to come to her senses.
</li></ul></li><li> Done in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em> manga when Yusei takes a test to gain the Stardust Spark Dragon. He starts out by riding at it full force to attack it head-on. But then remembers some earlier advice Akiza had told him and quickly snaps out of it. He then notices that the Stardust Spark Dragon is crying and sees through its memories of previous duelers who attempted to acquire it, making the mistake he nearly did. Yusei then drops his speed and lets the Stardust Spark Dragon attack him. Which allows him to be seen as worthy of wielding it and gain its card.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL">Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL</a></em> in Yuma and Nash's face-off: the Barian activated a card to decide the duel's outcome in a one-on-one battle between their ace monsters. Both duelists went on the offensive, only for Yuma to stop halfway and cancel his attack. Nash thought his former friend had a combo in mind, but Yuma <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Heartwarming/YuGiOhZEXAL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Heartwarming/YuGiOhZEXAL">merely didn't want to lose his friend</a>. Unknowingly to him, had he resumed his attack, he'd have lost the duel, and his noble gesture won him the game due to a loophole.
</li><li> This is how the fight between Mob and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">God Dimple</span> ends in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobPsycho100" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobPsycho100">Mob Psycho 100</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Upon reaching 100%, Mob realizes his powers are in the way of solving his conflict with Dimple, and they just need to talk it out like friends.</span>
</li><li> Touma does this to Mikoto in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em> to stop her from going to her death fighting Accelerator to stop the Level 6 Shift experiment involving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClonesArePeopleToo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClonesArePeopleToo">her clones</a>. Unlike all the previous "battles" they had, he refuses to use his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Imagine Breaker</a> to cancel her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">electric attacks</a> and instead takes them dead-on, refusing to fight back even as Mikoto screams at him to or get out of her way. This ends up shattering Mikoto's will to go through with her plan and she collapses in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryCute">crying heap</a>, and after comforting her it gives him a chance to settle things with Accelerator that ensures no one else has to die.

This has led to the "Deck out" style of play (also known as "milling"), where you remove cards from their deck, sometimes by making them draw, and do nothing else but defend against attacks. The downside to this is, of course, giving your opponent immense resources and could possibly allow him to pull off a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO">powerful combo</a>. A notable example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> is Kaiba using Crush Card and others to dump most of Ishizu's Deck in her Graveyard -which she then turns <em>back</em> on him with a card that switches the Deck with the Graveyard.

Once he realized that he likely would have killed Spidey if he had hit him, he just <em>let</em> Spidey punch him until Spidey realized it was pointless and gave up. (Then they finally realized they were on the same side, and joined forces against Lex Luthor and Doc Ock.)

Of course, since this Amazo had the personality of all the league and could get in tune with them, it resulted in him fighting himself until he self-destructed. It worked, but it was implied that it did more damage to the League in other ways.

They roll to hit like any other enemy, but do no damage unless you've attacked them first (thus showing you believe they actually exist); they vanish in a puff of smoke when killed and grant no Experience Points or item drops whatsoever. The area also contains "Shadow Fiends" that look the same, but are able to damage you regardless; it's these that you must actually attack. The hint that you're given to distinguish between the two is for your character to "Close your eyes and only strike back if it hurts you".

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em>, almost all encounters can be resolved through either fighting or granting mercy. Unlike most examples of this trope, however, the nonviolent option tends to require more effort than just not attacking, with some sort of action required to get the monster to stand down. Some encounters do result in a similar experience to the usual uses of this trope, though, such as the battle against Toriel, which is solved by repeatedly choosing the "Spare" option even though it initially doesn't seem to be doing anything, and trying to talk didn't help. There's also an inversion: in the Genocide route, the final boss eventually recognizes that you're winning, and plays with this trope to turn the tides. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He takes a turn in which he doesn't attack, meaning his turn never ends and yours never starts, so you can't attack him... in theory, anyway.</span> The main game itself has a different type of inversion: Asgore, at the start of the fight, will destroy the Mercy option, and you're forced to whittle his health until the game puts him at one HP, at which point you have the option of killing or sparing him.
<ul><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerspectiveFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerspectiveFlip">Perspective Flip</a> of this trope occurs early on in the Genocide route. Instead of trying to stop you through force of arms like Undyne <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and Sans</span>, Papyrus refuses to fight and offers you mercy and friendship.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControl">Star Control</a> II</em>, you encounter a lone Shofixti pilot named Tanaka who is hellbent on trying to destroy your vessel in revenge for the loss of his entire species, as he believes you to be an Ur-Quan starship. The proper course of action is to converse with him, use the various insults the game offers, and then warp out of the fight to repeat the cycle until it dawns on him that Ur-Quan don't insult opponents that way, so you're actually trustworthy. If you screw up and kill him in the fight (which is even possible on accident, as his ship is badly damaged and could careen into a planet if things go south), his brother Katana appears to let you try again. Kill <em>Katana</em> and the Shofixti's race <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">can't be recruited anymore</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris">Stellaris</a></em>, if you find yourself in a defensive war during the early game against a superior foe, the best advice is to keep building your economy and let them try and take your capital (hopefully armed with a defense station with a subspace snare by your starbase). The enemy fleet will be pulled right next to your starbase and fleet, and be unable to counter both. If you have a low enough war score, they will concede after a few tries at this and their economy will be in shambles. During the early game, your Starbase is your biggest gun and can take on all but the most Fanatical Militant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a> of the equivalent level.

Shooting Pyramid Head will speed up the battle and slow him down, making it easier to escape from a tight spot where it's hard to escape from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">a Great Knife to the head</a>.

As such, Velma directs everyone to sit on the floor and do nothing, prompting the AI to scream at them to pay attention to it until it overloaded and fried its circuitry.

Static learns the hard way that Tantrum is invulnerable and attacking him just makes him angrier and stronger.

<ul><li> This is basically the premise behind the martial art of Aikido, both philosophically (if you fight, you will lose against someone, it's only a matter of time) and pragmatically (the techniques emphasize the fact that you should not fight the opponent i.e. oppose his intention/movement or try to struggle with him).
</li><li> A lot of martial arts that are applicable towards self-defense seem to recommend the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">Screw This, I'm Outta Here!</a> school of self-defense: when confronted by (for instance) a mugger, you turn the hell around and run your ass off, or just give him what he wants. The "martial" part of the martial arts regimen only comes into play when avoiding physical harm befalling you or the mugger is no longer an option.
</li><li> According to legend, the Chinese philosopher <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Laozi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Laozi">Laozi</a> was never one to fight or argue, so when the border guard Yinxi demanded he record his wisdom for the good of the country before he would be permitted to pass, he simply said, "Eh, okay". He wrote for a month straight, eventually turning out the first draft of his masterpiece, the <em>Tao Te Ching</em>. (Or so the story goes.)
</li><li> Gandhi's resistance to the British empire. If the citizens had actively fought back against the empire (instead of resisting passively), they would have been violently suppressed by Britain's superior military, and the rest of the world would have thought it justified since the soldiers were only defending themselves. This only worked because of the British <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDissonance">Moral Dissonance</a> not really registering how brutal their regime was until they had to enforce it on people who refused even token resistance. Gandhi himself admitted it wouldn't have worked on someone like the Nazis, who just didn't care.
</li><li> The U.S. Black civil rights movement of the '60s. Fighting would have given their enemies ammunition.
</li><li> There is a Zen parable where a samurai asks a master if there is an afterlife and what it is like. The master challenged him, saying what sort of question was that for a samurai, and what worthless samurai would ask it? The furious samurai grabbed his sword and began to draw it, to which the master shouted, "Here open the gates of hell!" The shamed samurai, realizing his error, sheathed his weapon and asked for forgiveness, to which the master whispered, "And here open the gates of heaven."
</li><li> Nuclear war can be said to be this: The minute one nuclear weapon launches, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutuallyAssuredDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutuallyAssuredDestruction">it triggers a retaliatory strike by everybody with nuclear weapons</a>.
