Studios have long produced "extended" or "unrated" versions of movies that the directors were already satisfied with, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedSpecialCollectorsUltimateEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedSpecialCollectorsUltimateEdition">as a promotional gimmick to attract potential DVD buyers</a>. This is generally considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReCut">Re-Cut</a> or Director's Cut.
</p><p><em>This</em> trope goes one step past that, where a work is extensively changed by its creators (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodDoesNotOwnThisWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodDoesNotOwnThisWorld">and sometimes not even them</a>) to update the work with modern technology or new footage that was not available or recorded at the time the work was originally created. Film Purists (among both critics and directors) sometimes take issue with it, believing that altering the original film is diluting the charm of the original, diminishing the contributions of the original creative team (such as splicing in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">The Other Darrin</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeShemp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeShemp">Fake Shemp</a> over the original actor), or, worse, altering the context of scenes in how they played out originally and the plot itself. These changes include:

</li><li> Sound added to a silent film; the complications come from deciding on exactly what type of music to include, silent films sometimes had live accompaniment with music written especially for that film, but not all silent movies had a specific soundtrack attached to it.

</li><li> Adding new effects to existing scenes, which may include removing or adding people or objects.
</li><li> Newly recorded dialogue, sound effects or shots, often alongside a new edit to adjust the pacing.
</li><li> Color, hue, saturation and other image changes made for a new release. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalDestruction">Digital Destruction</a> covers when this is done to a detriment. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note05w07');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note05w07" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note05w07');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> This happens often incidentally rather than intentionally, as the nature of various image and viewing formats makes it almost impossible to say what was the original version as seen 100 years ago.

Some fans have widely criticized the reissues of the original <em>Star Wars</em> series, which they argue contrasts heavily with films otherwise <em>clearly</em> made between 1976-1983 but having bits and pieces of modern VFX tacked on. See the film examples for more on this and Lucas.
</p><p>Many times in the case of sequels and otherwise expanded franchises, these new versions are meant to help the franchise align better both visually and potentially fix <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">Continuity Snarls</a>. It's easier to sell box sets if they all have the same font.
</p><p>You can expect a considerable backlash when this trope appears, but as always consider that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">Tropes Are Not Bad</a>. Art is malleable, and having new work to appreciate can make us review both the old and new in a new light. These new versions are often intended to introduce the work to a new audience and often succeeds. In some cases the new version dominates the new releases, but in turn this can make the original almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudedInMyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudedInMyth">Shrouded in Myth</a>. Indeed, there are cottage industries on the internet of comparing different versions side by side, often using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">Keep Circulating the Tapes</a> methods to acquire the different versions. Conversely, similar complaints are leveled towards a Re-Cut in general, believing a theatrical release should be the end of editing.
</p><p>It's worth noting that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodDoesNotOwnThisWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodDoesNotOwnThisWorld">the majority of creators do not have final cut privilege or a copyright on their work, being really owned by the corporations</a>. Sometimes the new version is made by those who had nothing to do with the original, and the level of clout needed to do this to your own work is rare.
</p><p>This process is sometimes referred to as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Remaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Remaster">Remaster</a> but that is actually about cleaning the image to update it for modern entertainment formats, which often involves a brand new film transfer to help preserve it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Colorization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Colorization">Colorization</a> is similar, as making the colorization usually involves a remastering of the original to maximize quality<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2ua4k');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2ua4k" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2ua4k');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">People like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TedTurner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TedTurner">Ted Turner</a> restored the films in his library prior to colorizing them, and simultaneously released the restored black and white films alongside the colorized versions.

<ul><li> George Lucas is hugely infamous for constant tweaking of his films after they're "finished", starting all the way back to a 1981 re-release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em> where it got its <em>current name</em> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonCancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonCancer">Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope</a></em>), <em>Star Wars</em> was its original name and was eventually backpedaled into becoming the title of the franchise. He has said the reasons behind some of the changes were based on things they wanted to do but were unable to visualize with the budget or technology of the time, although some fans have misrepresented it as Lucas claiming <em>every</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodNeverSaidThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodNeverSaidThat">change was what he originally intended</a>. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.today.com/id/6011380/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/lucas-talks-star-wars-trilogy-returns/#.VCjpsVcyuIA">A 2004 interview with Lucas<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has him explain his feelings on the subject:
<div class="indent"><strong>Lucas</strong>: The special edition, that's the one I wanted out there. The other movie, its on VHS, if anybody wants it. ... I'm not going to spend the, we're talking millions of dollars here, the money and the time to refurbish that, because to me, it doesn't really exist anymore. It's like this is the movie I wanted it to be, and I'm sorry you saw half a completed film and fell in love with it. But I want it to be the way I want it to be.
</div><ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration">20th Anniversary</a> (1997) re-releases to theaters were billed as having newly included scenes, an additional 5 million dollars was spent on the new features. There are actually dozens, if not hundreds, of little changes made, most of which fans were ambivalent about (most are seamless unless doing an actual frame-by-frame comparison). The most infamous one was Han shooting Greedo in the cantina after a tense standoff which was altered to have Han dodge a "warning shot" by Greedo and return fire; it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalSelfDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalSelfDefense">changes</a> Han from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnscrupulousHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnscrupulousHero">Unscrupulous Hero</a> into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticHero">Pragmatic Hero</a>. This led to the internet meme of "Han Shot First!"
</li><li> The subsequent 2004 DVD release of the original trilogy included new changes to better align with the prequels, including an image of Naboo in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NationsOfTheWorldMontage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NationsOfTheWorldMontage">"Nations of the World" Montage</a> at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>. In addition, some changes were made to fix the new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectsFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectsFailure">Special Effects Failures</a> that happened with the alteration, including a less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel">Off-Model</a> CG Jabba the Hutt in a scene added in the 20th anniversary, and improving the matte lines of the rancor. They even cleaned up the "Han Shot First" scene by making it more of a simultaneous action (it's rumored the change only took place because of differing standards with the ratings board and PG movies, PG-13 didn't exist at the time of the original). Another change that didn't get criticized was changing the original Emperor hologram from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em> with one played by Ian McDiarmid, making sure Palpatine remains consistent through all films. <em>Return of the Jedi</em> featured the most controversial changes. Most notably having the unmasked Vader's face be digitally altered to make Sebastian Shaw resemble an older Hayden Christensen, and then replacing Shaw with Christensen as Anakin's ghost, which is the most hated change of all.
</li><li> The 2011 Blu-Ray release also made a few changes, the most obvious being a different Krayt Dragon call from Obi-Wan in <em>A New Hope</em> and Darth Vader giving another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo">Big "NO!"</a> before killing the Emperor in <em>Return of the Jedi.</em>
</li><li> A good deal of the enduring backlash comes with that Lucas has also been pretty apathetic about releasing the originals in their unaltered form. The limited DVD release was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanillaEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanillaEdition">Vanilla Edition</a> based off a quick transfer from the laserdisc print made in the early '90s.
</li><li> The restorations and resulting transfers also suffer from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalDestruction">Digital Destruction</a>, with lost color depth and the like from turning the contrast knob way up and other inept use of settings. It's unlikely the original, already bold and colorful, palette will ever return. The limited DVD based on the laserdisc transfer is more faithful but still washed out and has plenty of compression artifacts on fast motion.
</li><li> Of course, all of the above isn't helped by the fact that, in response to demands for an "unaltered release", Lucas has only acted by releasing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">a literally unaltered version</a> of the trilogy (i.e. exactly what you'd expect from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">an aged, mono-sound print from the 70s to be like today</a>). Naturally, the non-die hard fans were upset as they're either looking at a poorly aged version or a heavily modified one.
</li></ul></li><li> This not only applies to the original trilogy, but for home-version releases of the prequel trilogy as well. For instance, the Yoda in Episode I changing from a Puppet to a 3D Model when it went to DVD.
</li><li> Lucas made similar modifications to his first film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/THX1138" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/THX1138">THX 1138</a></em>, shooting new footage and using CGI to modify scenes by expanding crowds, settings and backgrounds and adding digital characters. Perhaps due to the fact this film lacked the iconic reputation of <em>Star Wars</em>, the changes weren't greeted with the same level of criticism, although fans were still upset that the original version of the film was permanently removed from circulation thereafter forcing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">Keep Circulating the Tapes</a> scenario involving earlier home video releases.
</li><li> With the backlash of the re-edits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>'s similar changes to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ETTheExtraTerrestrial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ETTheExtraTerrestrial">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a></em>, when it came to releasing the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones">Indiana Jones</a></em> movies on DVD they announced they would not make any changes. This was, in part, due to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> episode (listed below) mocking and condemning the practice.
<ul><li> There is a minor edit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></em> - when Indy falls into the cobra pit, in the theatrical cut it was extremely obvious that there was a pane of glass between Harrison Ford and the snake. The DVD version removes the reflection.
</li><li> Some recent airings of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></em> alter the scene where Gobler's car falls down the cliff. In the original film, it's done using a model of the car and a matte painting of a cliff and as the car falls it doesn't cast a shadow against the cliff, but for the TV airing, they digitally replaced everything - the cliff which now looks different and the car which is now in sharper focus and casts a shadow. Bizarrely, this version of the scene is only used for the TV airings. It hasn't turned up on any of the DVD and Blu-Ray editions of the film (which <em>do</em> contain the altered snake pit scene to remove the cobra's reflection).
</li></ul></li><li> Not even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanGraffiti" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanGraffiti">American Graffiti</a></em> was safe from this.
<ul><li> The first shot in the movie with Mel's Diner and the opening credits was given a digital sunset sky by Industrial Light &amp; Magic in 1998 replacing the overcast sky featured in the original version of the film. This was the only change though.
</li><li> Also, the 1978 reissue added two minutes of previously deleted scenes back into the film, and the soundtrack was remixed in Dolby Stereo. This is the version shown today.

<ul><li> Sometimes the artwork in manga originally published in magazines will be redrawn for the compilation volumes or tankoubon.
<ul><li> It also used to be common for manga to be flipped when exported to the US. This pretty much died in the early 2000s after publishers discovered that un-flipped manga didn't sell any differently, and after mangaka like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama">Akira Toriyama</a> spoke out against the practice.
</li></ul></li><li> It's pretty standard for anime episodes to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnhancedOnDVD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnhancedOnDVD">retouched or modified for reruns/home video</a>, sometimes with more obscene content, though usually it's just fixing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel">Off-Model</a> problems like bad eyes/animations or redoing the background a little, which is appreciated. The retouched versions are usually brought over to the states, but sometimes the broadcast versions are accidentally given to the US publishers.
<ul><li> On the other hand, the practice of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooHotForTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooHotForTV">removing censorship</a> such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryCensor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryCensor">Scenery Censors</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CensorShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CensorShadow">Censor Shadows</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CensorSteam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CensorSteam">Censor Steam</a> for DVD/Blu-ray releases, as compared to most TV versions, is generally just seen as a marketing strategy to sell more of the things.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal">Sailor Moon Crystal</a></em> is a recent show that benefited greatly from the Blu-ray remaster, which fixed many of the show's notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel">Off-Model</a> animation, continuity errors, and other glitches, resulting from the show's rushed production to premiere online. The Japanese TV broadcast features the revised episodes (with a couple more additional changes), as will the North American DVD/Blu-ray release.
</li><li> The second anime season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DateALive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DateALive">Date A Live</a></em> also got an incredible make-over for home releases, with over 40 minutes worth of content added, and fixing numerous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel">Off-Model</a> issues.
</li></ul></li><li> It also used to be very standard for anime series to be <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation">heavily</a></strong> re-edited when exported to other countries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">remove obscene content</a> among many other changes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">4Kids</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SabanEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SabanEntertainment">Saban</a> were notorious for practicing this.

</li><li> The 1995 movie adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em> was released on DVD and Blu-Ray in 2008 as <em>Ghost in the Shell 2.0</em>, with added CGI, modified scenes, and rearranged and re-recorded soundtrack and dialogue with a key character being voiced by another actor. The English Dub of the movie retained the original voice track, but re-mixed the audio and replaced the sound effects.
</li><li> The 1985-86 series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em> was turned into a 2005-06 movie trilogy called <em>Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam: A New Translation</em>, which mixed remastered and redone animation while also changing parts of the storyline.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWingEndlessWaltz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWingEndlessWaltz">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz</a></em> was originally released as a three-part OAV where some video releases had options of being linked together (skipping the opening and ending sequences) forming a near feature-length film. Several years later a new movie version was released for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration">Gundam's 20th Anniversary</a> that adds over 20 minutes of footage and key musical compositions rewritten. With the exception of a more elaborate and expanded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue">"Where Are They Now?" Epilogue</a>, all original footage is accounted for and the new footage is seamlessly integrated in between, fleshing out bits of the story along with more character pieces and extended action sequences. The new version has Dorothy make a cameo and factor into a major plot point while Heero's triumphant return to the battle is given a new scene showing his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicResolve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicResolve">Heroic Resolve</a>.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> movie trilogy was remastered for the 20th anniversary. Visually, nothing is changed. The surviving voice actors re-recorded their lines and several characters noticeably sound older than we remember them to be. The soundtrack was completely digitized but the futuristic gun sounds were replaced with more realistic sounding gunfire sound effects. The music for several scenes was either rearranged or more often removed in place of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">More Dakka</a> and explosion sound effects. The "Soldiers of Sorrow" song, for example, was removed from the Battle of Jaburo and replaces the original somber ending credits song of the second movie. In the third movie, "The Beginning" (Lalah Sun's theme) wasn't heard in her first scene. And its use in the end credits was replaced by the more upbeat "Encounter". Very few fans are actually aware of these changes unless they were familiar with UC Gundam prior to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">the late Nineties</a> so these changes have not met with much criticism from Western fans.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em>'s remastered release featured some new animation touch-ups and some creative changes like adding bodies to the coffins shown in the Black Rose arc. The audio was also remixed with new sound effects (although the English audio was untouched).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> This was a side effect of the Porygon incident, as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> had its first 37 episodes heavily altered to tone down bright light flashes. These post-Porygon masters were subsequently used for international versions of the series, though not for all of those that made the cut (some later episodes among this pack were imported in their pre-Porygon versions). Later, the first episode was remastered again, this time as a compromise between the pre-Porygon and post-Porygon versions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie">Pokémon: The First Movie</a></em> has the kanzenban ("full version"), which adds CGI effects and a ten-minute prologue about Mewtwo's origin not in the Japanese theatrical version. The kanzenban (though initially without the prologue) was the version released internationally and in all subsequent TV airings and video releases.
</li></ul></li><li> For its 10th anniversary, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh">Azumanga Daioh</a></em> gained a remake that had art and dialogue changes to existing chapters, as well as quite a few new ones as well.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> manga was reprinted in 2003 to coincide with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyGuardianSailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyGuardianSailorMoon">Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon</a></em>. It featured updated artwork and dialogue, and the chapters were reorganized into fewer volumes. These reprints were later used for Kodansha USA's 2011 stateside retranslated rereleases.
<ul><li> They were revised and re-collected again in 2013 to coincide with the 20th Anniversary and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal">Sailor Moon Crystal</a></em>. These are Japanese-only, not being available in the US as of this writing.

Some changes were corrections (like making the size of soul gems consistent, etc), while others were more noticeable—such as making one of Sayaka's battles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodierAndGorier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodierAndGorier">Bloodier and Gorier</a>, and turning Mami's stark and lonely apartment into a cozy space full of plush toys.

<ul><li> Reprints of earlier <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a></em> stories would change the Hulk from gray to green, but this is no longer necessary as the gray Hulk form is now established in continuity.
</li><li> Trade-paperback and omnibus collections may use digital coloring to make colors appear solid and brighter instead of washed out, and may appear differently than the original printed version. There may also be edits to infoboxes irrelevant to the story, such as referencing another issue or a notification of "to be continued".
</li><li> Reprinted Dr. Droom stories renamed the character to Dr. Druid.
</li><li> Earlier monster or horror stories framed with a generic narrator may be replaced with The Watcher or another Marvel-related narrator.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> reprinted the original series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest">ElfQuest</a></em> new pages had to be added by Wendy Pini to fit the total page count. Some of these were new episode titles and recaps, while others were new or expanded story pages. Most of the latter were included in subsequent reprints; due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a> it's usually not too hard to tell which. A few of the new episode titles were also included, causing some disruption to the original chaptering. Controversially, the series was also re-lettered with bigger balloons which obscured more of the original art and removed some special formatting. This was not corrected until the art was finally "remastered" with computer lettering and coloring, which is the version currently available on the official website. Another reformatting took place when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a> reprinted the series in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manga">Manga-style</a> volumes, requiring Pini to expand, contract or extend existing comic panels to fit the new page size.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke">The Killing Joke</a></em> was recolored for the 20th-anniversary edition, making the scenes darker and more muted, in contrast to its original, more garish colors. Almost inarguably an example of how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad">Tropes Are Not Bad</a>.

</li><li> The Absolute edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman">The Sandman</a></em> featured re-done colours (and for one issue, even completely re-inked linework) for some of the issues, which had been let down originally by time pressures or technical limitations.
</li><li> Some <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix">Asterix</a></em> comics have had their art reworked, often to deal with foreign markets. Perhaps the most obvious example occurs in <em>Asterix in Switzerland,</em> in which Asterix and Obelix get the wheel of their chariot repaired by a man resembling the Antar service station mascot. As Antar is not very well known outside of France, this was replaced with the Michelin Man in English editions.

When fans complained, further re-releases retained the original art with only a new coloring job—for the most part. While for some time, the first page claimed that the story was "reprinted with the original art from many years ago by popular demand," some stories would still have redrawn elements. On top of that, the stories that were redrawn in the first place have remained so, making the only way to see the original versions to collect the original printings or catch one of the limited edition "classic" reprints whenever they happen.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a> was unhappy with one artist's work in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheInvisibles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheInvisibles">The Invisibles</a></em>, so in the collected edition he had another artist redraw those pages. This is definitely a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad">Tropes Are Not Bad</a>: the pages in question are essential in explaining how time works in the Invisibles universe, but the original artist hadn't quite understood Morrison's script, whereas the replacement artist was much better at illustrating his ideas.

Though most of the rewritten dialogue is better that the original, the fans complained about two things. First, one or two funny <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">Getting Crap Past the Radar</a> moments were removed; and second, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales">DuckTales</a></em> crossover arc "<em>Dangerous Currency</em>" was not reprinted.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note47zvi');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note47zvi" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note47zvi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Neither is, however, Sparrow's fault: the removal of the risqué joke was naturally ordered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> and "Dangerous Currency" has the bad luck of having came out during a disagreement between Disney and the company that owned the license to publish the Darkwing Comics, which through a number of loophole effectively caused "Dangerous Currency" to be published illegally (i.e. at a time where the company actually didn't have the license anymore).</span> Following this collection published by publisher Joe Books, Inc., a new ongoing Darkwing Duck comic will begin, naturally ignoring "Dangerous Currency".

He admitted to this in the collection <em>The Pre-History of The Far Side</em>, with an example shown - a bulls-eye rug mysteriously disappears halfway across the panel in the original run, while it's completely filled in for the collections. As Larson became better at cartooning, this became much less frequent. Several of the collections (particularly in <em>The Far Side Gallery</em> collections) also have colorized versions of the strips, which most fans don't seem to mind.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Youngblood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Youngblood">Youngblood</a></em> was reprinted in trade form in 2008, its colors were altered to be more consistent and less garish, and certain scenes were re-done in order to fix continuity errors that were present in the original versions.
</li><li> In 2018, it was announced that Top Shelf would put out a new version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a> and Eddie Campbell's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FromHell">From Hell</a></em>. The original was in black-and-white but the second version would be colorized by the original artist Eddie Campbell with Moore's consent. The plan is to colorize the trade paperback edition, publish it serially in chapters, with a new epilogue written and drawn by Moore and Campbell.
</li><li> In its early days <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/DoctorWhoMagazine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/DoctorWhoMagazine">Doctor Who Magazine</a></em> used to have backup strips presented by the Fourth Doctor as a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHost">Horror Host</a>. When the Auton story "Business as Usual" was reused as emergency filler in 1992, the opening image of Fourth was replaced by Seventh.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DarkStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DarkStar">Dark Star</a></em> was originally a 68-minute student short film. When it was acquired for distribution, new footage was added by the producer. Later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCarpenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCarpenter">John Carpenter</a> and Dan O'Bannon re-edited the film into a "director's cut", removing much of the footage shot for the theatrical release and adding new special effects.
</li><li> Producer/cowriter John A. Russo decided to release a "30th Anniversary Edition" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightOfTheLivingDead1968" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightOfTheLivingDead1968">Night of the Living Dead (1968)</a></em>, with no involvement from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeARomero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeARomero">George A. Romero</a>, the director and Russo's writing partner. The reissued version added a new score, newly filmed scenes, and altered sound effects. Harry Knowles threatened to ban anyone from Ain't It Cool News if they defended or complimented this version of the film.
</li><li> Writer and producer William Peter Blatty produced a recut of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExorcist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExorcist">The Exorcist</a></em>, creating "The Version You've Never Seen". This version added some CGI fixes to certain scenes, added subliminal imagery, restored a scene where the possessed Regan carries out a contorted "spider-walk," and features a longer ending which sets up the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExorcistIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExorcistIII">The Exorcist III</a></em>. In this case all the added footage had in fact been shot with the rest of the film back in 1973, but the director, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamFriedkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamFriedkin">William Friedkin</a> simply didn't want to use it. Blatty did, and eventually got the chance to create his own edit.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halloween" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halloween">Halloween</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Halloween1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Halloween1978">Halloween</a></em> (1978) has an alternate extended version with 12 minutes of additional scenes shot in 1981 for television during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenII1981" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenII1981">Halloween II</a></em>'s production. These scenes do little to advance the plot, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCarpenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCarpenter">John Carpenter</a> prefers viewers view the film without them, but they do tie some things together with the sequel, and some fans insist on watching the movie with them intact.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenII1981" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenII1981">Halloween II</a></em> (1981) also has an alternate version that was shown on television. Unlike the above example, this alternate cut was almost completely different from the theatrical version as it featured many bits of scenes added in or taken out, and many scenes were re-arranged, resulting in noticeably different pacing. It also arguably featured better character development. Unfortunately, this cut only exists with cable TV censorship, even as an extra feature on the DVD release. Also, a lot of fans objected to Universal's Blu-ray release that replaced the "Moustapha Akkad Presents" title card with "Universal, An MCA Company, Presents." This was apparently an accident, as the fans complained loud enough for Universal to fix this.
</li><li> There was an alternate cut of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenTheCurseOfMichaelMyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenTheCurseOfMichaelMyers">Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers</a></em> (1996) called the "Producer's Cut." It's technically the original cut of the film before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">the Weinsteins</a> ordered re-shoots. It's often seen as superior to the theatrical version for having better character development and making more sense. It also was completed before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldPleasence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldPleasence">Donald Pleasence</a>'s death, meaning his character originally survived the film. The theatrical version was completed after he died, and his character was killed off in that cut. This is also the version Daniel Farrands (the original screenwriter) prefers, although he admits he's not a big fan of either one. Despite fans' insistence, the Producers Cut was never been legally available on home video for years, with it only surviving through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">bootlegs</a>. Fortunately, an official release finally happened on Blu-ray as a part of the complete franchise boxset from Anchor Bay and Shout! Factory struck from a print discovered in a vault in Canada. There's also a "Director's Cut" shown on television which is basically the theatrical version with some scenes from the Producer's Cut spliced in.
</li><li> Both "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobZombie">Rob Zombie</a>" films have theatrical and extended unrated director's cuts with alternate endings.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>:
<ul><li> He was the first person to make a special edition, for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CloseEncountersOfTheThirdKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CloseEncountersOfTheThirdKind">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a></em>. Due to the original production running over time and budget, many scenes had to be cut from shooting. But due to the success of the film, Spielberg managed to convince Columbia to allow him to film these sequences (like the ship in the desert) and release a new version (called the Special Edition) in 1980. However, there was one gripe: He also had to shoot a new ending inside the spaceship (something Spielberg never wanted to show) and it was of course this part that the studio wanted to focus on. This version also had many scenes from the theatrical cut, but with new ones instead. Then in 1997, he released a Director's Cut: Essentially the 1977 cut (though with some scenes, like the power station and a scene with a pre-Rocky Carl Weathers as a soldier cut) with most of the new sequences (besides the inside of the spaceship of course) inserted. All three are included in the Blu-Ray.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ETTheExtraTerrestrial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ETTheExtraTerrestrial">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a></em> had quite a few for its 20th-anniversary release. In addition to a few new scenes with a CG E.T., it had a scene in which the FBI agents' shotguns were digitally replaced with Walkie-Talkies, which was particularly derided by fans. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LewisBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LewisBlack">Lewis Black</a> jibed that the FBI agents were using the Walkie-Talkies to ask each other, "Where the hell are our guns?!? We're trying to stop an alien from escaping!" Unlike Lucas, Spielberg later regretted the changes and now only the original 1982 version is available on Blu-Ray.
</li></ul></li><li> The Director's Cut of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DonnieDarko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DonnieDarko">Donnie Darko</a></em> greatly alters the pacing of the film, adding deleted scenes and new special effects, and switching the soundtrack of the movie around. Author Richard Kelly regards this version not as a director's cut (this title was the publisher's idea) as he considers the theatrical version just fine in its own right. Instead, to him the new version is a special edition of sorts. Notably, many critics, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a>, preferred the director's cut.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HappyBirthdayToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HappyBirthdayToMe">Happy Birthday to Me</a></em>'s original DVD release from Columbia featured a different musical score. This version was actually taken from an old workprint that had a temporary musical score. Anchor Bay's re-release featured the proper score, as does Mill Creek's Blu-ray.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMonkey">Iron Monkey</a></em>: The 2001 Miramax release replaces the soundtrack, sound effects, opening and closing credits, and has over 100 edits, including slowing down sped-up fights, and removing moments of violence and comedy from scenes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheReturnOfTheLivingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheReturnOfTheLivingDead">The Return of the Living Dead</a></em> has a version that altered the voice of the zombie who says "Send more paramedics!" The zombie had a shriller, higher voice in the earlier version of the film, and lower voice in the newer version of the film. The result isn't as funny as the original scene was.
</li><li> There's a very bizarre DVD edition of Ulli Lommel's 1983 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBoogeyman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBoogeyman">Boogeyman 2</a></em>. The original version of the film wasn't very good by any stretch of the imagination, but it is unanimously preferred over what Lommel claimed was a "Director's Cut". This version consists of cheaply shot footage of Lommel being interrogated by off-camera police officers, and "flashbacks" that are 90% derived from Lommel's 1980 film <em>The Boogeyman</em>, which <em>Boogeyman II</em> was a sequel to. The original version of <em>Boogeyman II</em> did consist of a lot of flashback footage from the first film, but it did have some new content, whereas the 2003 version of <em>Boogeyman II</em> is 90% footage from <em>The Boogeyman</em>, 10% <em>newly filmed</em> content. So fans of the original version of the film were not at all pleased by this version, invoking the George Lucas Altered Version trope.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> classic film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoldRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoldRush">The Gold Rush</a></em> was re-released by Chaplin himself in 1942 with some edits, instrumental music and replaced the title cards of the original silent film with his own narration. Thus making this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTelevision">Older Than Television</a>. The original silent version of <em>The Gold Rush</em> was finally released on the Chaplin MK2 DVD, later on the Criterion Collection, being for a long time very obscure.
</li><li> From the '80s until its first DVD release in 2005, the English-dubbed release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DangerDiabolik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DangerDiabolik">Danger: Diabolik</a></em> suffered from this; the original track was presumed lost, and the recordings that existed were mixed with new voices of inferior quality; also, a reference to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobinHood">Robin Hood</a> was removed, possibly in order to avoid the ire of Disney (who made an animated movie about the legend) or Warner Bros. (who had just come out with their own Robin Hood movie around the time the VHS and Laserdisc of <em>Diabolik</em> was released). It wasn't until 2005 that a DVD was released with the original English track as heard in theatres.
</li><li> Towards the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997">Titanic</a></em>, a shot of the Milky Way in the night sky was rather lazily mirrored. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NeilDeGrasseTyson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NeilDeGrasseTyson">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a> pointed this out to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCameron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCameron">James Cameron</a>, who initially laughed him off but later enlisted him to provide an accurate star map, which was included in the 10th Anniversary DVD.
</li><li> This happened to the 1979 version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dracula1979" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dracula1979">Dracula</a></em> starring Frank Langella as the Count. Since the Laserdisc edition in 1991, every home video release of the film has muted, desaturated colors to better reflect the original intent of the director, who wanted to film in black-and-white. The 2019 Blu-Ray release contains the desaturated cut on the first disc, and the original theatrical version on the second.
</li><li> A unique version happens with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardDonner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardDonner">Richard Donner</a> version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanII">Superman II</a></em>. The original movie was mostly directed by Richard Lester, who was hired to replace Donner after he was fired partway through. To prevent legal issues in the original, the movie had to be at least 51% Lester directed and that required refilming a lot of scenes and changing the script by adding in a lot of comedic elements (which Donner opposed and is the reason he was fired). Donner was given the opportunity to put together a new cut that represented his vision for the film, called "The Richard Donner Cut" instead of simply a Director's Cut. It ended up being about 75% Donner in theory, re-editing Lester-directed scenes to the best of their ability and with others they made do with limited rehearsal footage. They included some deleted fx scenes (including one where Superman is thrown into the Statue of Liberty Torch) and he reluctantly included a CG creation of Zod and company destroying the Washington Monument, which replaced the more comedic defacing of Mount Rushmore (but kept the same reaction line from the President).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner">Blade Runner</a></em> was already famous for the number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Recut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Recut">Recuts</a>: theatrical, workprint, Directors Cut and Final Cut, in large part due to the mystique surrounding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RidleyScott" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RidleyScott">Ridley Scott</a> being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">removed in post production</a>. The biggest change noticed was the removal of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateEyeMonologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateEyeMonologue">Private Eye Monologue</a> in all subsequent versions along with the forced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyEnding">Happy Ending</a>, while the workprint and Director's Cut were not officially approved by Scott due to still being unfinished. The 25th Anniversary Final Cut fell under this trope as it fixed continuity errors, airbrushed revealing mistakes, added a few CG-assisted backdrops, adjusted the editing in key scenes and modified the color correction throughout. Unique to most examples of this trope, Ridley Scott made most of the previous, unaltered cuts of the movie readily available for anyone who wanted them in Blade Runner's boxsets on DVD, HD-DVD and Blu-ray.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture">Star Trek: The Motion Picture</a></em> was originally released on DVD on a director's cut that re-edited the movie while adding some new CG effects by Foundation Imaging to get closer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertWise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertWise">Robert Wise</a>'s intended vision (it is well known that Wise was unable to complete the film's effects to his satisfaction before its original release). Unlike what Lucas did with the <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy, the new CGI effects were made to closely resemble special effects in 1979 as opposed to souped-up modern-day visuals. Many found it an improvement to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveTheCameraRunning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveTheCameraRunning">an overwhelmingly slow feature</a> that became a bit more watchable, but given that Foundation went out of business one year after release, it has yet to get a Blu-Ray release due to the MIA status of the CG archives necessary for a proper remastering. There is some indication that the archives may still exist, as it was revealed in 2013 that some former Foundation employees made backups of their <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> archives (they had done extensive work on the later seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Deep Space Nine</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Voyager</a></em>); however, it remains to be seen if CBS/Paramount will act on this at all, and as of late 2015 the Director's Edition is still only available in DVD resolution. (The DVD release also includes, for those who want to see them, all the trims removed from the Director's Edition version, plus footage from the extended TV edition.)
</li><li> The original English-language version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoodTheBadAndTheUgly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoodTheBadAndTheUgly">The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</a></em> was significantly edited down from the Italian version before the dub was recorded, and the removed scenes went un-translated for decades. It wasn't until 2002 that a special edition was created which returned the 14 minutes of missing footage, with newly-recorded English dialogue. However, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeeVanCleef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeeVanCleef">Lee Van Cleef</a> had passed away, his character's lines had to be performed by Simon Prescott, and it's quite easy to tell that his voice isn't quite a match for Van Cleef's. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood">Clint Eastwood</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EliWallach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EliWallach">Eli Wallach</a> were able to return to record their character's lines, but their voices were noticeably older. Additionally, the entire movie's soundtrack was completely remixed and partially re-recorded, with several sound effects being noticeably altered, especially the gunshots. The DVD and Blu-ray also include a second audio track featuring the Italian dialogue and the original sound mix.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomOfTheOpera1925" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomOfTheOpera1925">The Phantom of the Opera (1925)</a></em> is an early and very mysterious example of a movie getting several alternate versions. The movie was originally released silent in 1925, but it was re-released with sound in 1930 to capitalize on the advent of "Talkies." About 60% of the movie was re-shot with sound (and with some changes to the cast), with the remaining silent footage just having new dialogue dubbed in. No film copies of the sound version exist (the soundtrack itself does, however), but there's <em>another</em> version of the movie called the Eastman House print, and nobody is really sure where it came from. It's silent, but some of the footage is obviously taken from the sound version, and the footage taken from the earlier silent version is slightly askew, suggesting it was shot from a secondary camera positioned to the side of the main one. There's also a scene that looks like it was shot for the 1930 version, but nothing that matches it can be found in the 1930 soundtrack. Home video releases offer several differing restored versions, one of which attempts to match up the soundtrack with the Eastman House print, ultimately making the situation even more confusing.
<ul><li> Some believe the Eastman House print was a silent edit of the 1930 version of the film made for overseas release or theaters not yet equipped for sound presentations.
</li></ul></li><li> The original CBS television edit of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheOther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheOther">The Other</a></em> changes the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a> with a voiceover where Niles tells Holland <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (his evil alternate personality that takes the form of his dead twin brother)</span>, that they can't play "the game" anymore, and that he'll ask the sheriff if they can play together in their new home when he comes to take them away for their crimes. This edit doesn't exist on any of the video releases.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dracula1931" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dracula1931">Dracula (1931)</a></em> was released so early into the era of sound films that it almost completely lacks a musical score; music can only be heard over the opening credits and when the characters themselves are listening to music. In 1998, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Universal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Universal">Universal</a> hired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilipGlass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilipGlass">Philip Glass</a> to compose a complete score for it, and the movie got a new VHS advertising the update. The DVD and Blu-ray releases give the viewer the option of viewing the film with the score turned on or off.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeDMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeDMovie">3D re-releases</a> of movies that were originally shot and shown in 2D have become the 2010s equivalent of colorization, though they tend to not attract as much controversy since there's little chance of the 3D versions ever replacing the originals. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCameron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCameron">James Cameron</a> kicked off the trend with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997">Titanic</a></em>, which lead to 3D conversions of other films such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace">The Phantom Menace</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">The Wizard of Oz</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994">The Lion King</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FindingNemo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FindingNemo">Finding Nemo</a></em>. Sometimes, as was the case with <em>Jurassic Park</em>, the CGI gets updated and elements like rain and debris get digitally beefed up to enhance the 3D effect.
</li><li> There's a short film parodying this phenomenon, styled as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mockumentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mockumentary">Mockumentary</a> about digitally remastering all the audio for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSting">The Sting</a></em>'s DVD release. The lead audio engineer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint">wildly misses the point</a>—for example, he adds sci-fi sound effects to all the outdoor scenes (because he insists the movie isn't set in the 1930s, but in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaysOfFuturePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaysOfFuturePast">a far future that happens to look just like the 30s</a>) and redubs Paul Newman with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">a campy lisp</a> (because that's <em>obviously</em> how director George Roy Hill meant for the character to sound all along), and so on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Deadpool2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Deadpool2">Deadpool 2</a></em>, when it was released on DVD/Blu-Ray, came out with a "Le Super Duper Cut", which includes a longer version of Deadpool's madcap assault in the beginning and a post-credits scene where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Deadpool hems and haws over if he should kill baby <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a></span>.
<ul><li> A new version of the movie called <em>Once Upon a Deadpool</em> had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">Framing Device</a> as Deadpool shared a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> version of the story to Fred Savage from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessBride">The Princess Bride</a></em>. This was an experiment, as the original graphic content meant the film <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EditedForSyndication" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EditedForSyndication">was vetoed for release in the lucrative Chinese market whereas this version passed</a>. The domestic reception was lukewarm, although box office was okay.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanleyKubrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanleyKubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a> also edited and altered his films between releases and for home video versions. The original version of <em>2001</em> was longer than the current version, and Kubrick himself cut down and removed the scenes. He did the same with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShining">The Shining</a></em> sending out an order to projectionists that part of the ending be cut from the film during its first week in theatres, and then paring the film down further for its international release.
</li><li> In the case of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spartacus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spartacus">Spartacus</a></em> which Kubrick directed, and was produced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KirkDouglas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KirkDouglas">Kirk Douglas</a>, Kubrick had long since considered that a studio assignment. When the film was restored, Kubrick was consulted but generally let the restorers go about their business. They restored the original film with 14 minutes that were cut from the original scene, including a scene alluding to Crassus' bisexuality. Since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenceOlivier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenceOlivier">Laurence Olivier</a> had passed away, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnthonyHopkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnthonyHopkins">Anthony Hopkins</a> voiced the character mimicking Olivier's voice in those deleted scenes. Kubrick approved the final version and addition of these scenes and this is the version of <em>Spartacus</em> available on home video.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLean">David Lean</a>'s original cut for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LawrenceOfArabia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LawrenceOfArabia">Lawrence of Arabia</a></em> was nearly four hours long with intermission. This was screened at the premiere but was cut down to three hours for the general release. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, Lean collaborated on the restoration and revived his four-hour cut which had never been widely distributed theatrically. He got the surviving actors to redub dialogue despite being older than they were when they played the roles. This is the version subsequently re-released later, and is currently on home-video.
</li><li> The French comic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JacquesTati" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JacquesTati">Jacques Tati</a> for his film, <em>M. Hulot's Holiday</em> (made in the '50s) added an entire new gag spoofing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws">Jaws</a></em> which he put in for the re-release in the '70s.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonWelles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonWelles">Orson Welles</a> himself was noted for making changes between previews and later versions. After the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTrial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTrial">The Trial</a></em>, he went back and removed an entire scene, and the film currently in circulation is this version. After the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TouchOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TouchOfEvil">Touch of Evil</a></em>, he wrote a memo detailing how he would like to salvage the film and this memo led to a new version in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> which created an entirely new version of the film, with altered scenes, some brought forward, others moved back, the opening credits removed entirely and moved to the end, and with a few inserts to suggest more nuance in character. Likewise, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, Welles tried to attract studios for a plan to salvage <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMagnificentAmbersons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMagnificentAmbersons">The Magnificent Ambersons</a></em> by shooting a few scenes with the surviving cast which, Welles argued, would seamlessly match the existing version but failed to attract interest.

</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em> got an authentic transfer in the 2012 Ultimate Trilogy boxset, the version released in 2014 was rife with this. It featured a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeContrast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeContrast">Blue and Orange Contrast</a> colour grade, various odd sizing changes such as the size of Rexy's head and making Muldoon's thighs bigger, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerize">removing Rexy chomping on the head of a Gallimimus</a>, or just cleaning up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeffGoldblum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeffGoldblum">Jeff Goldblum</a>'s hair for a specific scene (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalDestruction">not to mention heavy use of Digital Noise Removal, removing a lot of the finer details</a>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">On the other hand</a>, various infamous goofs are fixed, such as a light in the back of a shot or the cables used to flip the Jeep in the T-Rex breakout scene.
</li><li> The DVD version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Incredibles2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Incredibles2">Incredibles 2</a></em> removes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticFlashingLights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticFlashingLights">strobe effect</a> from most shots of the Screenslaver's hypnotic screens. This was most likely an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">Author's Saving Throw</a>, since these sequences faced criticism for being difficult on the eyes and potentially dangerous to epileptics while the film was in theaters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scarface1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scarface1983">Scarface (1983)</a></em> received a new surround sound mix when the film was re-released in 2003, replacing almost all gunshot sounds with newer ones, removing music added inappropriately to certain scenes and making some of Tony's dialogue more audible in the climatic mansion massacre. From 2006 to 2011, this new mix was the only one used in all future releases of the film. The original mix would eventually resurface in the Blu-ray release, albeit in 2.0 stereo sound.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GorillaInterrupted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GorillaInterrupted">Gorilla Interrupted</a></em> was shot mostly in a week by a few amateur filmmakers in their early 20s with no budget and very little motivation to do things well. Over ten years later, some of the filmmakers had formed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/RedLetterMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/RedLetterMedia">RedLetterMedia</a> and decided to create a remastered version with better editing and effects. While they found that their terrible coverage at the time meant that they could make very few improvements in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReCut">Re-Cut</a>, they did add some new visuals, such as making new UFO effects, turning the Jesus scene into a live-action sequence, and making a prop landscape for Hell. They bundled this version with a making-up documentary called <em>How Not to Make a Movie</em> and sold it on DVD.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ZackSnydersJusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ZackSnydersJusticeLeague">Zack Snyder's Justice League</a></em> is a different beast from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReCut">Re-Cut</a> of other films of his. It isn't so much an extended version as it is going to be a new <em>film</em> altogether (hence its own dedicated page). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JusticeLeague2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JusticeLeague2017">theatrical film</a> used very few untouched footage from what Snyder filmed (mostly action sequences), the rest was an amalgamation of altered Snyder footage (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid">Darkseid</a> — who was axed from the theatrical — was replaced by Steppenwolf in the ancient battle for instance) and footage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a> filmed on an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">executive mandate</a>. The theatrical cut thus told a different story and scrapped numerous characters, subplots and backstories, in addition to added humor in Whedon's style and botched special effects due to the limited time to work on it back in 2017.

The so-called "New York Edition" was what he saw as his true version of the books. In most cases, his revision, at least for <em>The Portrait of a Lady</em> are subtle, and alter and shift nuance in key scenes, and many see this as improvements but others prefer the originals and different publishers reprint either versions with notes specifying which edition is which.

In 1822, it was re-published in two volumes, this time attributed to Mary Shelley, but the text was unchanged. In 1831, the book was finally published in one volume, with a new introduction explaining how Shelley came up with the idea, and this time the text <em>was</em> heavily edited in order to make the story more conservative. The 1831 version is featured in nearly all modern editions of the book, unless they specifically say "1818 text" somewhere on the cover.

So far this has included works such as <em>Junky</em> and <em>Naked Lunch</em>.
</li><li> In 2008 they started reprinting books from the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Goosebumps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Goosebumps">Goosebumps</a></em> series under the name <em>Goosebumps Classic</em>. Several books were altered to "update" them:
<ul><li> In <em>Welcome to Dead House</em>, each grave's birth and death dates were moved forward several years to make them more recent (why this makes it scarier is up for debate). Now, some characters were even born <em>after</em> the book was originally published.
</li><li> In <em>The Scarecrow Walks at Midnight</em>, several things Mark brought with him to amuse himself at the farm are mentioned. The reprint changes "Walkman" to "iPod." This change is especially awkward, because it keeps a mention of his Game Boy in the <em>very same sentence</em>.

Some original music, most notably the opening theme, was also re-recorded. On the original HD-DVD release, <em>only</em> the "remastered" version was available at first, causing purists to accuse CBS Paramount of pulling a Lucas (made worse by the fact some minor editorial visual changes were made to some episodes as part of the remastering); however, subsequent Blu-ray releases <em>have</em> included the original versions, though <em>not</em> as the default option (you have to change <em>from</em> the "remastered" versions to watch them). CBS Paramount has also been doing their best to show <em>only</em> the "remastered" versions in syndication, at least in certain markets.

The key difference between the TNG and TOS remasters is that for TNG, CBS had an almost-entirely complete archive of the well-preserved original film to work from, and there were very few scenes that required all-new effects work (most notably the all-CGI crystalline entity from "Datalore" and "Silicon Avatar", which had to be recreated from scratch), and there were no redesigns or "editorial changes" involved (as was the case with the planets and other effects in TOS).
</li><li> A few DVD releases of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> (Including "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS2E2TheDalekInvasionOfEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS2E2TheDalekInvasionOfEarth">The Dalek Invasion of Earth</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E2TheArkInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E2TheArkInSpace">The Ark in Space</a>") have had new special effect sequences inserted, better than what was available with the technology (and budget) of the time. However, in all cases, the original broadcast version is also included and the viewer can choose if they want to watch the original or the 'improved' version. An especially heavily altered case is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS9E1DayOfTheDaleks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS9E1DayOfTheDaleks">Day of the Daleks</a> (Special Edition)" which replaces the effects with slightly jarring 00s CGI and some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux">Retraux</a> practical effects, adds additional Daleks to fill out invasion scenes which used only two wobbly props, edits out some of the worst <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure">Special Effect Failures</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OohMeAccentsSlipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OohMeAccentsSlipping">acting SNAFUs</a>, and redubs the Daleks with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicholasBriggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicholasBriggs">Nicholas Briggs</a>. Another special edition was "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS21E5PlanetOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS21E5PlanetOfFire">Planet of Fire</a>", which included the addition of some new scenes; once again, however, the original version was released alongside.
<ul><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS20E5Enlightenment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS20E5Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS26E3TheCurseOfFenric" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS26E3TheCurseOfFenric">The Curse of Fenric</a>" both have "Movie-style" editions on their respective releases, editing the episodes into one continuing feature-length episode, both reordering some scenes for better narrative flow and updating some effects. "Fenric" also features colour regrading to mask inconsistent weather conditions during the shoot, while "Enlightenment" has been given a 16:9 aspect ratio.
<ul><li> "Enlightenment's" special edition was supervised by the director of the original serial.
</li></ul></li><li> For its first DVD release, the 20th anniversary special, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho20thASTheFiveDoctors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho20thASTheFiveDoctors">The Five Doctors</a>" was issued in a revised edition with newly made special effects and other changes. The new version was heavily criticized by fans and for a time was the only version available in the format. Later, the original version of "The Five Doctors" was issued in a new edition alongside the remastered version, allowing viewers a choice. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5z5i9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5z5i9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5z5i9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Special Edition had originally been made as a VHS release, mostly as an experiment.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a> repeated this again in 2019 when they released the <em>Doctor Who Season 18 Collection</em> on Bluray. Tom Baker's swansong episode, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS18E7Logopolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS18E7Logopolis">Logopolis</a>", now has updated special effects, replacement of the model footage of the radio telescope in motion in Part 4 with live-action footage of the telescope at Jodrell Bank, and an additional scene <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> where, after watching his hand slip away from the strut as we do in the original, we see the Fourth Doctor plunge to his death</span>.
<ul><li> Similarly, the <em>Season 19 Collection</em> release of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS19E1Castrovalva" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS19E1Castrovalva">Castrovalva</a>" replaces the modelwork representing the titular city and the TARDIS being pulled into Event One, and reworks several visual effects, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienGeometries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienGeometries">the shots of Castrovalva folding in on itself.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> The <em>Season 23 Collection</em>, comprising the <em>Trial of a Time Lord</em> season, goes a step further by offering a complete alternate "Special Edition" cut of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS23E3TerrorOfTheVervoids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS23E3TerrorOfTheVervoids">Terror of the Vervoids</a>", with all of the <em>Trial</em> story arc's courtroom scenes removed, new CGI effects, and an entirely new title sequence that combines the style of the Sixth Doctor's sequence with the styles used in the modern show. To offer a bit of further context, the season proper involves the Doctor being put on trial and shown segments of his life from his past and future, with "Vervoids" being the story from the future, and part of the plot is hints that the story is being selectively manipulated in order to frame the Doctor. The joke, then, is that this edit is the version of the story from the unseen season that it was supposedly taken from, and the viewer is finally seeing what actually happened.
</li><li> A bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac">Fleetwood Mac</a>'s "Oh Well, Part 2" appeared on the soundtrack of Jon Pertwee's debut story "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS7E1SpearheadFromSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS7E1SpearheadFromSpace">Spearhead from Space</a>" on first broadcast (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">Stock Footage</a> workers in the plastics factory seem to be listening to Radio 1), but the rights were secured only for original transmission and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers">the song was removed</a> for rebroadcasts, exports, and home video release. The version as broadcast no longer exists.
</li></ul></li><li> The first three series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> (from 1988 and 1989) were released as "Remastered" editions intended for overseas sales in 1998. The changes included most of the model shots being replaced with CGI<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6fdyr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6fdyr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6fdyr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Actually intended to be better model shots, but the new Red Dwarf model was too big to fit in the studio</span>, a film effect being applied (despite the decade-old series obviously not being filmed or lit for it), a fake "widescreen" effect by cropping the picture, trimming some scenes whilst extending or replacing others and adding other new music and special effects.
<ul><li> The DVD release of <em>Red Dwarf VII</em> includes the made-for-VHS "Red Dwarf Xtended" releases of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RedDwarfSeasonVIITikkaToRide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RedDwarfSeasonVIITikkaToRide">Tikka To Ride</a>", "<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RedDwarfSeasonVIIOuroborous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RedDwarfSeasonVIIOuroborous">Ouroborous</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RedDwarfSeasonVIIDuctSoup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RedDwarfSeasonVIIDuctSoup">Duct Soup</a>", featuring material that had to be cut for time, but lacks an audience track due to this season having not been filmed with one. "Tikka" is also given an option to watch the episode with much higher quality CGI shots of Starbug, replacing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectsFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectsFailure">rushed and almost-cartoony original attempts.</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7eslo');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7eslo" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7eslo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This season <em>did</em> have an actual audience for its laugh track, but they were shown the finished episodes at an event pre-broadcast.</span>
<ul><li> The <em>'Red Dwarf VIII</em> DVD includes feature-length editions of "Back in the Red" (which had been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">meant to be a feature-length special on broadcast</a>), and <em>Pete</em>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>:
<ul><li> When the show was picked up for a fifth season by TNT, the pilot was reworked considerably, including redoing some effects shots, replacing the soundtrack, and dealing with various editing and pacing issues. The redone version was titled <em>Babylon 5: The Gathering</em>, and aired as part of the show's fifth season.
</li><li> The show as a whole is a massive subversion: it was filmed in widescreen and cropped to 4:3, but the CG effects were only animated in 4:3. The assumption was that advances in special effects would render it trivial to re-do the effects when it came time for a widescreen, higher-definition remaster. It wasn't, the show has only ever been released in 4:3 or a 16:9 format created by cropping even <em>more</em> footage from the top and bottom, and the low-resolution CG models, especially in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">first season</a>, have aged terribly, especially compared to contemporaries which used practical effects.
</li><li> Series creator JMS has stated that a Blu-ray version will likely never be available because it would require updating the SFX at a cost of approximately $105,000 per episode, or about $12 million for entire series. Though the live-action portions were filmed with Super 35 film so they can be scanned at higher resolutions, the CGI archives for all five seasons were lost by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a>. To make it worse, according to JMS, someone high-up at WB evidently has a grudge against him, and has been doing their level best to keep the show from being restored or bought by another network that might try to do something with it.
</li></ul></li><li> Some episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> were altered for their first re-airing, which is the version on DVD. For instance, "Adrift" added a shot of the World Trade Center towers to better establish the time frame of the flashbacks. Another episode removed a white car that was visible in the background during a scene on the Island.
</li><li> An updated version of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a></em> aired in 2010 on ABC Kids with updated special effects and comic book-inspired graphics.
</li><li> It is commonplace for TV series to be released to home video with some music either edited out or replaced by other recordings, due to licensing issues. Examples include <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren">Married... with Children</a></em>, which replaced its opening song by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> with a generic piece of music, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WKRPInCincinnati" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WKRPInCincinnati">WKRP in Cincinnati</a></em>, which had so much of the original music removed on its initial DVD release that critics asked what was the point of releasing it in the first place. In some cases (such as <em>MWC</em> and <em>WKRP</em>), later reissues have had some or all music restored. In extreme cases, some TV series releases have had to omit entire episodes due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers">insurmountable rights issues</a>. In a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">No Export for You</a>, North American releases of some <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> episodes have had to have recordings by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> removed from the soundtrack (i.e. "The Chase" and "Remembrance of the Daleks"); UK releases, however, are unaltered. (More examples under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers">Screwed by the Lawyers</a>.)

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder7');">    Music </div><div class="folder" id="folder7" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> This is often done with remixes in pop/hip-hop/r'n'b music, where the original artist gets other artists to perform new parts of their hit single on the track's original beat.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JayZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JayZ">Jay-Z</a> is a notable subversion, as his remixes generally involve the track getting a new beat, and very rarely do guest MCs perform. An exception for Jigga was "30 Something (Remix)", which featured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IceCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IceCube">Ice Cube</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OutKast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OutKast">Andre 3000</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rihanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rihanna">Rihanna</a> did this on her <em>Unapologetic</em> album with the tracks "Diamonds" and "Pour It Up". "Diamonds (Remix)" had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KanyeWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KanyeWest">Kanye West</a> lay a verse on it (coincidentally, Kanye also has a song called "Diamonds" in his own right), whilst "Pour It Up (Remix)" had a star-studded remix involving four guest rappers (Young Jeezy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RickRoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RickRoss">Rick Ross</a>, Juicy J and T.I.). The latter is notable in part because Ross and Jeezy were on the same track (most likely because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">Money, Dear Boy</a>), despite both being enemies at the time.
</li></ul></li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa">Frank Zappa</a> started reissuing his catalog on compact disc, he decided to completely revamp many of his albums. In particular, entries like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WereOnlyInItForTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WereOnlyInItForTheMoney">We're Only in It for the Money</a></em>, <em>Cruisin' with Ruben &amp; the Jets</em> and <em>Hot Rats</em> were completely different from their original vinyl incarnations. Zappa added newly recorded instrumentation to <em>Money</em>, <em>Jets</em> and a few other albums, like <em>Sleep Dirt</em> (originally an instrumental album, the CD featured newly recorded vocals by Thana Harris, with lyrics derived from the unproduced musical <em>Hunchentoot</em>, where many of that album's songs originated), which featured newly recorded drumming and bass guitar tracks by then-current musicians like Chad Wackerman and Arthur Barrow. Reportedly, the new instrumentation on these albums was because many of the original band members on the recordings, including drummer Jimmy Carl Black, were suing him over unpaid royalties. <em>Hot Rats</em> did not feature any <em>new</em> instrumentation, being that all of the material was recorded at the original sessions, however, the original recordings were sequenced, mixed and edited in a way that made <em>the exact same recordings</em> sound drastically different from the original album.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> was working on an album at the time of his death, to be titled <em>First Rays of the New Rising Sun</em>. It was never completed as intended, due to his death. The recordings were subsequently scattered across several different contractual obligation albums released by his label, with various alterations made after his death to complete the unfinished recordings. Producer Allan Douglas decided to alter these recordings further by releasing <em>Voodoo Soup</em>, which Douglas alleged presented the album as Hendrix <em>would have intended</em>, which is subjectively untrue, as there was no telling as to how Hendrix would have completed the album if he had lived. One of Douglas' alterations was to add newly recorded drum tracks played by Bruce Gary, of The Knack, a band that formed in 1978, several years after Hendrix died. After the Hendrix family gained the rights to his compositions and purchased the master tapes for his recordings, <em>Voodoo Soup</em> was pulled off the market and replaced by <em>First Rays of the New Rising Sun</em>, a purist-friendly reconstruction of the unfinished Hendrix album, which presented the songs in the versions that were mostly complete by the time of Hendrix' death, plus minimal overdubs in accordance with Hendrix's wishes (the vibraphone on "Drifting"), compiled and sequenced by Eddie Kramer and Mitch Mitchell.
</li><li> In 2002, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OzzyOsbourne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OzzyOsbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a> decided to reissue <em>Blizzard of Oz</em> and <em>Diary of a Madman</em> with the original drum and bass tracks replaced with new recordings from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Robert Trujillo</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FaithNoMore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FaithNoMore">Mike Bordin</a>. This was because his original drummer and bassist Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake had sued him in 1986 for royalties for the two albums. Fans were outraged and music critics derided the reissues. Ozzy later changed his mind about these reissues and had the original albums reissued in remastered versions in 2011, restoring all of the original instrumentation, causing much rejoicing among Ozzy's fans.
</li><li> On the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GetoBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GetoBoys">Geto Boys</a>' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum">Self-Titled Album</a>, "Gangsta of Love" was originally built around a sample of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteveMillerBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteveMillerBand">Steve Miller Band</a>'s "The Joker". However, the sample was not properly cleared, and it was subsequently replaced with a remixed version that instead samples <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LynyrdSkynyrd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LynyrdSkynyrd">Lynyrd Skynyrd</a>'s "Sweet Home Alabama". The remixed version isn't as effective.
</li><li> In 1996, guitarist Tony Iommi of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath">Black Sabbath</a> fame made some solo recordings featuring the drum work of Dave Holland, formerly of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JudasPriest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JudasPriest">Judas Priest</a>, but didn't consider them fit to release at the time (it was subsequently bootlegged). When Iommi was finally convinced to release the EP, Holland had been convicted of attempted rape, and Iommi decided to have his drumming re-recorded, as he did not want the album to be associated with a sex offender. The 2004 EP release <em>The 1996 DEP Sessions</em> therefore consists of 1996 recordings with 2004 drums (played this time by Jimmy Copley).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DarkLotus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DarkLotus">Dark Lotus</a>' <em>Tales from the Lotus Pod</em> was altered to remove the vocals of former member Marz. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/InsaneClownPosse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/InsaneClownPosse">Violent J</a> explained that he wasn't satisfied with the album as it was originally released, as he found Marz' raps to be too dark and morbid. Thus, it was reissued with newly recorded vocals by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PsychopathicRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PsychopathicRecords">Psychopathic Records</a> artist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AnybodyKilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AnybodyKilla">Anybody Killa</a>.
</li><li> In 1970, on the precipice of the band's break-up, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> released their 12th studio album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LetItBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LetItBe">Let It Be</a></em>, essentially cobbled together by producer Phil Spector from various studio recordings and out-takes. In 2003, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a> would release <em>Let It Be... Naked</em>, a remixed version of the album that stripped out Phil Spector's choral and orchestral overdubs (which were probably necessary at the time to salvage parts of the material), and digitally cleaning tracks using technology not available at the time. Unlike most iterations of this trope, both versions remained readily available.
</li><li> Dave Mustaine uses this as much as George Lucas with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Megadeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Megadeth">Megadeth</a>'s catalogue:
<ul><li> As part of an agreement to get out of his contract, Mustaine ended up "remastering" all of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Megadeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Megadeth">Megadeth</a>'s catalogue at Capitol Records (basically all their albums up to <em>Risk</em> minus the first one.) However, his idea of remastering involved creating completely new mixes of everything. The result is interesting, but fans still overwhelmingly prefer the original versions, especially as some of the master recordings were supposedly lost and had to be re-recorded. <em>Rust in Peace</em> in particular had missing vocal masters, meaning either alternate takes or new ones by 2004 Mustaine (which clash quite a bit with himself more than a decade prior).
</li><li> Mustaine also completely reworked MD.45's album <em>The Craving</em>, removing the input of Lee Ving (vocals and harmonica) entirely, and adding his own vocals and extra guitar. Mustaine initially claimed that Ving's parts were lost, but later said that he did it because he was disappointed in the failure of the original version, and thus effectively made it a Megadeth album.
</li><li> Mustaine also provided totally different covers for <em>Killing Is My Business</em> and <em>Risk</em> (in the former's case, to his relief, as the band was appalled at how cheap the original was and the illustration is closer to Mustaine's original sketch), a modified one for <em>Cryptic Writings</em>, and changed the color saturation and logo sizes on the others.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidSylvian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidSylvian">David Sylvian</a> finally released the Japan outtake "Some Kind Of Fool" on his 2002 collection Everything And Nothing...but added new vocals to the original instrumental. Whilst Sylvian's singing had definitely improved, the vocals were incongruous with the older music. He did similar versions of Ghosts and solo track Brilliant Trees, the former also on Everything And Nothing, and the latter on a limited 3CD edition of it.
</li><li> In 2009, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kraftwerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kraftwerk">Kraftwerk</a> released remastered versions of all their albums, save their first three which they've <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">more or less disowned.</a> Among other changes, the album <em>Electric Cafe</em> was changed to <em>Techno Pop</em> (its' original working title), and the cover of <em>Trans Europe Express</em> was changed to a simple train logo rather than a portrait of the four band members (possibly because two of them had long since split from the band, and not exactly on good terms either).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CirqueDuSoleil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CirqueDuSoleil">Cirque du Soleil</a> did this with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Saltimbanco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Saltimbanco">Saltimbanco</a></em> soundtrack in 2005 — along with adding two songs that hadn't appeared on the original 1992 album, all of the original release's songs either had re-recorded portions or were new recordings, reflecting the significant changes made to the show's orchestrations over the years to sound less like products of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>.
</li><li> For his 1998 career-spanning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedSet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedSet">Boxed Set</a> <em>Tip of the Freberg</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanFreberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanFreberg">Stan Freberg</a> decided to add some newly recorded material to the archived recordings on there. In one case, he re-recorded some lines cut from the original release of the 1954 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephMcCarthy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephMcCarthy">Joseph McCarthy</a> satire "Point of Order". In other cases, he did new re-creations of radio commercials he'd written and voiced back in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>. There was one big problem with this: Freberg was in his 70s and had a much deeper and throatier voice than in his younger days, so it was blatantly obvious where the 1998 material got shoved into the older recordings.
</li><li> A rather unusual example occurred with <em>Days of Future Passed</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMoodyBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMoodyBlues">The Moody Blues</a>; in 1972, it was discovered that the master tapes for the album had deteriorated to such an extent that only the essential parts of each track survived. As a result, the album was heavily remixed for all reissues from 1978 to 2016. The original 1967 mix was eventually recovered and digitally transferred in 2017, just in time for a 50th-anniversary reissue on CD, DVD, and LP.
</li><li> When John Fahey's 1959 debut <em>Blind Joe Death</em> was reissued in 1964, a few songs were re-recorded. In 1967, he re-recorded the album almost entirely, and did the same with its 1963 followup <em>Death Marches, Breakdowns &amp; Military Waltzes</em>. In the case of the first reissue of <em>Blind Joe Death</em>, this was done because he felt he'd become a much better guitarist in the five years since its release. In the case the <em>Death Marches</em> reissue and the second <em>Blind Joe Death</em> reissue, it was for the same reasons, but also in order to reissue the recordings in stereo. 1999 reissues of both albums consist of the original recordings followed by the re-recordings.
</li><li> Two years after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a>'s death, Parlophone announced a complete revamping of his much-panned 1987 album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeverLetMeDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeverLetMeDown">Never Let Me Down</a></em>. Dubbed <em>Never Let Me Down 2018</em>, it will feature completely new backing tracks produced by Mario J. McNulty, who previously produced a similar remix of "Time Will Crawl" for Bowie's 2008 <em>iSelect</em> compilation album. The album is expected to release on October 12, 2018, both as part of and alongside the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedSet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedSet">Boxed Set</a> <em>Loving The Alien (1983-1988)</em>; a digital release of <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTGGb2VUmGg">the remixed version of "Zeroes"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was released in July, with a physical 7" release containing an edited "Beat of Your Drum" as a B-side released in September. The new version of "Zeroes" on its own features a much more organic sound than the original 1987 version, lacking the heavy synthesizer work that marked the original album's perceived overproduction.
</li><li> Lawrence made several alterations to half of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Felt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Felt">Felt</a> catalog when all their albums were remastered in 2018. One album in particular, <em>Ignite the Seven Cannons</em>, was remixed in its entirety due to Lawrence being highly critical of producer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CocteauTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CocteauTwins">Robin Guthrie</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EchoingAcoustics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EchoingAcoustics">original mix</a>, whilst another, <em>Let the Snakes Crinkle Their Heads to Death</em>, was re-released under its original working title <em>The Seventeenth Century</em>. Martin Duffy's lengthy instrumentals on <em>The Pictorial Jackson Review</em> were also dropped in favour of two unreleased recordings, "Jewels are Set in Crowns" and "Tuesday's Secret".

For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em>, this often involved small adjustments to the placement of pipes and blocks.
</li><li> Following the extremely negative response to the original ending/s of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare">BioWare</a> spent several months working on an improved version, including the creation of many new cutscenes and the recording of new dialogue as well as some minor retcons to the original story. This would become available to download as a free DLC called the 'Extended Cut' several months later, which would replace the original ending if installed, and is thought considerably better by most fans. Still not quite the ending that they wanted, in many cases, but certainly better than what they had before.
</li><li> For the Orange Box, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ValveSoftware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ValveSoftware">Valve Software</a> enhanced <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em> with re-done HDR-compliant lighting in all the maps as well as replacing the named NPCs' original character models with the more recent ones made for <em>Episode One</em>. In 2010, they finally got around to pushing this as an update to the PC version, but introducing a few bugs in the process that never got fixed, such as the lighting breaking in some spots if HDR isn't enabled.
<ul><li> More blatantly, in 2010, they patched <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal">Portal</a></em> to, after the game is beaten once, add hidden radios in every chamber that have to be brought to a certain spot to pick up an encrypted signal; getting them all unlocks a new achievement, "Transmission Received". A further update added a new ending where Chell doesn't escape the facility after all, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain">gets dragged back in by a mostly-unseen Aperture robot</a>. These changes received surprisingly little outrage, as they ended up being the start of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateRealityGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateRealityGame">ARG</a> that ultimately teased a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2">sequel</a>.

The original MSX2 game featured photo-realistic portraits that were obviously traced from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed">real-life individuals</a> at the time. The later versions replaced these with more stylized depictions patterned after Yoji Shinkawa's art style from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em>, most likely done to avoid any potential likeness infringement issues.

However, some fans did not like it for removing or adding changes such as censoring out more swear words. As a result, the N64 version was emulated on <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RareReplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RareReplay">Rare Replay</a></em> instead of the Xbox version.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Devil May Cry</a></em> had this happen a few times: DMC3 had to be re-released in America as a mistake resulted in its normal mode being the Japanese hard mode. DMC4 got a few new scenes added in at the beginning and end for its re-release on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PS4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PS4">PS4</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne">Xbox One</a>, then the reboot <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DMCDevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DMCDevilMayCry">DmC: Devil May Cry</a></em> actually had some scenes removed for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> on the PS4 and Xbox One in order to resolve some pacing issues that reviewers and fans criticized the game for.

Both had improved visuals and a hint system, but the latter went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>, which was evident in the start of the game when the bank moves from West Clock Town to South Clock Town, Link can get the Bomber's Notebook without even going through the Bomber's quest, and even saving is much easier in that no longer do you wait for a sword and can do it even as Deku Link.

</li><li> Jynx might be the only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a> to have suffered from this. Originally they had black skin, but after the "Jynx is racist-looking" controversy that followed the US airing of "Holiday Hi-Jynx" it was permanently changed to blue skin by the time Ruby and Sapphire had come out. All reissues of the original games have since followed suit. Also, said anime episode was removed from rotation since 2013, alongside two others due to the American office's attempt to move the series to streaming services, with worries over kids discovering that Jynx used to look "different". However, the PokeRap feature was ignored so Jynx's original black skin may still be there if you look closely.

Most campaign heroes were given unique models instead of just using existing units. Some locations, like Stratholme, also have a new layout to match WoW. The previously cut final few missions of the Exodus of the Horde campaign (which explains how the Darkspear trolls joined the Horde) are also fully restored, with finished cutscenes and voice acting.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaryPoppins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaryPoppins">Mary Poppins</a></em> got this for the 2004 40th Anniversary DVD edition. The film boasted an "Enhanced Home Theater Mix", which replaced nearly all the original sound effects with new ones to make the film sound more "modern" and "realistic," along with similarly sweetening the music in some areas. ABC Family also aired this version of the film from 2006 to 2012. This redubbed mix does not appear on subsequent DVD and Blu-Ray editions, however (and the original soundtrack was one of the sound options on the 2004 DVD.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeautyAndTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeautyAndTheBeast">Beauty and the Beast</a></em> boasted some new animation, remixed audio and a new musical number based on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutSong">Cut Song</a> from the film's early development (that was later reused to much acclaim in its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScreenToStageAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScreenToStageAdaptation">Broadway adaptation</a>) in its 2002 IMAX release. The visual changes and the new musical number made their way to every home video release that followed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994">The Lion King</a></em> had the same treatment as <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> in both its own 2002 IMAX release and every home video release that followed. It also had a new song, also taken from the film's Broadway adaptation, replacing the original Pouncing Lesson scene on the 2003 Platinum DVD release. Unlike with <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>, however, this new song was later relegated to the Bonus Features on every home video release from 2010 onwards while the original Pouncing Lesson scene was restored (albeit with the IMAX visual changes the rest of the film had still present).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin">Aladdin</a></em> also received this treatment, but the low gross of the <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> and <em>Lion King</em> IMAX engagements compelled Disney to release this print directly to DVD.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WinnieThePooh">Winnie-the-Pooh</a> And Christmas Too!</em> was included in its entirety to pad out <em>A Very Merry Pooh Year</em>, the color of Rabbit's fur was changed from the pale green color it was in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNewAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNewAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh">New Adventures</a></em> era, to the yellow color it had been before and after that. Edan Gross's voice for Christopher Robin was also dubbed over by his then-current actor William Green.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClassicDisneyShorts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClassicDisneyShorts">Classic Disney Shorts</a>:
<ul><li> In 1948, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThreeLittlePigs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThreeLittlePigs">Three Little Pigs</a></em> was partly reanimated and redubbed so that the Big Bad Wolf's peddler disguise doesn't look or sound like a Jewish stereotype.
</li><li> The 1933 short <em>The Night Before Christmas</em> had a scene near the end where a kid looks into his fireplace and comes out in blackface from the soot. An edited version has since been made in which the kid, while still getting soot on his face, doesn't appear to be in blackface.
</li><li> When a shortened version of <em>Mickey's Parrot</em> was prepared for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel">Disney Channel</a>'s <em>Have a Laugh!</em> series, Mickey's shotgun was replaced with a broom.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Several <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em> cartoons have been altered by reanimating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncleTomfoolery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncleTomfoolery">Mammy Two Shoes</a> as <a class="urllink" href="http://heykidscomics.wikia.com/wiki/Mammy_Two_Shoes">a slim white woman<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and redubbing her voice. Those edits have been rarely seen since the early 90s when Mammy Two-Shoes was reinstated, but her voice redubbed with a more realistic African American voice instead of the stereotypical dumb-sounding black voice she had in the 40s/50s. The DVDs have a mix of both voices, depending on the cartoon, but the new Blu-rays retain the original voice for every cartoon.
</li><li> Both discussed and parodied in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> episode "Free Hat". The plot of the episode concerns the boys' attempt to get Lucas &amp; Spielberg to stop changing their films. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodyCommercial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodyCommercial">Parody Commercial</a> in the middle features Live-Action Matt Stone &amp; Trey Parker, creators of <em>South Park</em>, offering for sale an altered version of the pilot episode of <em>South Park</em> featuring all-new CGI.
<div class="indent"><strong>Announcer</strong>: Yes, all the charm of a simple little cartoon will melt before your eyes as it is replaced by newer and more standardized animation!
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Parker</strong>: In the scene at the bus stop, we always <em>meant</em> to have Imperial walkers and giant dewback lizards in the background, but simply couldn't afford it.
</div><ul><li> Also, when the boys break into the video library of George Lucas himself, they find not only home videos, but altered versions of them as well (e.g. "Kids First Swimming Lesson w/ Digitally Enhanced Weather").
</li><li> In the episode, George Lucas is more hesitant to changing the movies and Steven Spielberg is more antagonistic, but in real life, Lucas has continued to change his movies and Spielberg regretted doing it.
</li><li> <em>South Park</em> itself has re-animated HD versions of the first 12 seasons, which were originally animated in 4:3 in standard definition. The DVDs feature the original versions, but the reruns and streams on Hulu and SouthParkStudios.com feature the revised versions.
</li><li> Matt and Trey discuss this on the DVD commentary for the episode "A Million Little Fibers", saying that if they could "George Lucas" one episode, it would be this one.
</li></ul></li><li> Generation 2 of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> franchise was given its own television show, which was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">several episodes of the Generation 1 cartoon</a> edited to add CGI effects and other minor differences. Before that, the fifth season of the original cartoon, airing after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> "The Rebirth", consisted entirely of rebroadcasts of older episodes, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformersTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformersTheMovie">the movie</a> in five parts (albeit slightly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">bowdlerised</a> to remove both swears, as well as featuring the music video for "The Touch" due to the last part running slightly short), with additional live-action bookend sequences featuring conversations between Optimus Prime and a human boy named Tommy Kennedy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gumby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gumby">Gumby</a></em> was given this in the 1950s and 1960s episodes, when they were rerun as part of the 1988 reboot <em>Gumby Adventures</em>. All of the old episodes had their soundtracks redubbed with new music, voice tracks and sound effects to sound consistent with the new episodes of the time. Many <em>Gumby</em> fans did not like this change, and were very disappointed when the initial DVD releases of the series from Rhino used the redubbed soundtracks (due to legal rights involving the John Seely/Capitol stock music utilized in the originals.) Current DVD and digital releases of the 1950s and 1960s shorts utilize the original soundtracks, while the redubbed versions have become harder to find in recent years (thankfully).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em>: There were some occasions where certain jokes were redone, either due to sensitivity or for being severely outdated.
<ul><li> In the 1940 short <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AWildHare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AWildHare">A Wild Hare</a></em>, Bugs covers Elmer's eyes and tells him to guess who he is; one of his guesses is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CaroleLombard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CaroleLombard">Carole Lombard</a>. When the short was reissued after Lombard's death in a plane crash, Elmer's guess was changed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BarbaraStanwyck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BarbaraStanwyck">Barbara Stanwyck</a>.
</li><li> In the 1948 short <em>Bugs Bunny Rides Again</em>, Yosemite Sam introduces himself as "The roughest, toughest, he-man-stuffest hombre that ever crossed the Rio Grande — and I ain't no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MahatmaGandhi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MahatmaGandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a>!". When the short was reissued following Gandhi's assassination that same year, the line was changed to "And I ain't no mamby-pamby!"
</li><li> The 1959 short <em>Wild and Wooly Hare</em> features a scene where Yosemite Sam throws a tin can into the air and shoots it full of holes before daring Bugs to try it. The original cut had Bugs try to shoot the can on its way down and accidentally fire at Sam, but when the short had to be edited for Saturday morning television, the scene was reanimated so that Bugs now shoots corks to plug the holes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>: In the 2001 episode "The Day the Earth Stood Stupid", a stupefied Bender shouts "Let's all join the Reform Party". When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral">Comedy Central</a> acquired the show near the end of the decade, the line was changed to "Let's all join the Tea Party".
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ACharlieBrownChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ACharlieBrownChristmas">A Charlie Brown Christmas</a></em> went through several changes and touch-ups, apart from removing the Coca-Cola ads. <a class="urllink" href="https://vimeo.com/308488838">This video gives the complete rundown.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
