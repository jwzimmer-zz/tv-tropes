This reaction of humiliation and resentment may be spoken, acted upon, or merely felt, but it is some variation on "I don't want your pity," or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">"Don't You Dare Pity Me"</a>. This may be used as actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockPhrases" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockPhrases">Stock Phrases</a>, but the reaction does not have to be verbalized.
</p><p>The more serious the problem, the more likely this is to cause conflict. Temporary situations can invoke it for a time, as when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears">Manly Tears</a> or worse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandInMyEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandInMyEyes">Sand In My Eyes</a> causes another to try to comfort the weeping character.
</p><p>This is most likely to come from a character who does not deal well with sympathy, even in the best of times. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Broken Bird</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledButCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledButCute">Troubled, but Cute</a>, The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen">Ice Queen</a> are particularly likely to react this way. Indeed, it may develop that their touchy character stems from this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">can be resolved</a> if it is. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWomanWearingTheQueenlyMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWomanWearingTheQueenlyMask">The Woman Wearing the Queenly Mask</a> doubly so, since anything for which she can be pitied is a weakness and danger. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoicWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoicWoobie">Stoic Woobie</a> is often this trope embodied. Getting them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyreCalledPersonalIssuesForAReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyreCalledPersonalIssuesForAReason">fess up about it, much less confront it, can be a difficult prospect</a>.

They might accuse others of having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComeToGawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComeToGawk">Come to Gawk</a>. They might fear that any response to their problem will break them down when they cannot afford to break down. The pity may be effusive for a trivial problem, or something that the character does not consider as such. In other examples, the character cannot tell their remorse is sincere; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass">Handicapped Badass</a> is managing just fine, thank you.
</p><p>At the other extreme, the sufferer rejects sorely needed and selflessly offered help and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveMeAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveMeAlone">suffers all the more for it</a>. They might <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveHurts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveHurts">inflict suffering on others</a> in the process.
</p><p>Genuine pity is often portrayed as an affront to the dignity of the pitied, as the pity-er is at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CondescendingCompassion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CondescendingCompassion">implicitly signaling their advantage over and superiority to the pitied</a>, though there is also the popular Aesop that too much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">Pride</a> is foolish and shallow. The injured character may hide from others to preempt pity. For any such character, mentioning his problem may hit a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a>. The character can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">wallow in self-pity</a>, but that is different.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The effect is more dramatic if the characters knew each other before the injury or if the problem is invisible. The pitying character may change after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a>. If the other person is in any way responsible for the injury, things can get very ugly indeed.
</p><p>A hero <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryForTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryForTheDevil">sympathising</a> with a villain's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">backstory</a> may also incite this response, but be careful, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">this trope can be done badly</a>. A character frequently angrily rejecting any form of comfort may come across as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">Ungrateful Bastard</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallyUnsympathetic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallyUnsympathetic">Unintentionally Unsympathetic</a> when that may not even be the case. Alternatively, this can be presented as a genuine character flaw.
</p><p>Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkNothingOfIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkNothingOfIt">Think Nothing of It</a>, for when a character wants to avoid praise for admirable behavior, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveMeAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveMeAlone">Leave Me Alone!</a>, a common phrase also said by characters of this type, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PastExperienceNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PastExperienceNightmare">Past Experience Nightmare</a>, where the character tries to hide his pain but it still comes out in his unguarded moments.

No matter how strong she got — quickly going from being a joke to taking down championship-level wrestlers with a single attack — she still couldn't reach Maki's level, and every fight they had ended with Kaori unconscious or even near death. In the final episode, as Maki is on her way to face her final challenge against 'The Strongest Man,' Kaori challenges her one last time. She is at the peak of her power, even embracing a rage-powered near-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a>, and yet Maki and the viewers know that she doesn't have a prayer. But when Maki says "I'm sorry, but... it'll take only one minute," Kaori literally explodes in fury, not at Maki's confidence in her own skills, which is well-founded, but in the pity inherent in the first part of the statement. Taken aback, Maki apologizes and recants. "One minute." (It takes barely ten seconds, but Kaori is smiling as she goes down.)

<ul><li> Similarly, part of Haru's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">promiscuity</a> stems from it being one of the few ways she's found to have others treat her as an adult, instead of regarding her like a helpless child in need of protecting.

"<em>You</em> felt sorry for <em>her</em>? You felt <em>sorry</em> for her?" replies the prosecutor, causing both Tom and Atticus to immediately realize that the concept of a black man pitying a white woman will offend the jury so much that whatever extremely slim chance they might have had of acquittal has been lost, and Atticus's closing statement specifically draws attention to how having the "temerity" to pity a white woman is <em>not</em> reason enough to convict him.

But it's in Schuyler's closing argument that he really shines:
<div class="indent">Their whole case comes down to the premise that dwarf-tossing is cruel and depraved. This despite the fact that no tossed dwarf has ever come forward with a complaint.

That prejudice can be found in the premise that little people need protection. That little people are not competent to make the choices. We dont know what to do, so youll prescribe for us what we should do. I am an attorney. I became an attorney because I wanted to and because it is my right. It is also my right to become a human projectile if I wanted to. And if you limit that right in my best interests, you limit my freedom to make the choice. You erode my autonomy. You demean my individuality. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is a far greater detriment to self-esteem than being thrown around in some bar.

<ul><li> This carried over into the match; Flair was obviously unable to put up an actual fight, but he refused to simply lay down and be beaten.

Their pity usually actually makes things worse for him, such as preventing him from going on a camping trip for little reason or getting his crush suspended. Somewhat ironically, when Boyd is temporarily confined to a wheelchair, Pelswick feels sorry for him, and this is Boyd's reaction too.
