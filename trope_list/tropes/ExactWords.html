<ul><li> Cape Cod Potato Chips proudly advertises their low fat (6 g) chips as "40% reduced fat," and in tiny letters underneath, "compared to regular potato chips." This is entirely true — except that it's not <em>their</em> (kettle-cooked) "classic" chips (8 g) they're being compared with; it's <em>Lay's</em> and most (conveyor-cooked) store brands, which typically have 10 g fat and are, indeed, more "regular" to the average person's idea than kettle-cooked chips. By the same logic, they could sell their classic chips as "20% reduced fat."

</li><li> As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieBrooker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieBrooker">Charlie Brooker</a> has pointed out; wording in advertising is key. For example you can't say a toothpaste will "eliminate" plaque build up but will instead, "help fight". As you can fight a wall but you probably won't get far.
</li><li> Volkswagen ads spoof the exact wording of "sign and drive" car sales by having someone drive a car while simultaneously trying to sign a contract. This then segues into their "Sign, <em>Then</em> Drive'' Event promotion.
</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/TheSimpsons">Simpsons</a></em> Butterfinger commercial had this:
<div class="indent"><strong>Homer</strong>: I'm gonna open my mouth and close my eyes and <em>you're gonna give me a big surprise</em>. (Bart sticks Maggie's pacifier in Homer's mouth)

In 1986, Silo ran a commercial featuring a sale on stereo systems in which the $299 stereos were described as "<a class="urllink" href="https://priceonomics.com/the-stereo-system-that-cost-299-bananas/">299 bananas<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0bhra');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0bhra" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0bhra');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which ran between $35-$50 in 1986 dollars</span>. While most customers figured out what Silo meant, several customers in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OtherCitiesInTexas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OtherCitiesInTexas">El Paso, TX</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seattle">Seattle, WA</a> decided to test the "299 bananas" gambit, bringing in a total of 11,000 bananas to the local Silo stores. The chain, to their credit, accepted the bananas (the Seattle location donated the bananas they received to a local zoo, with the zoo keeping around 1,000 and donating the rest to area food banks) but quickly scrapped the ad after announcing a loss of just over $10,000.

Motu eats the samosas given to him anyway... but he takes the shells off of them and only eats the insides. He explains to Chaiwala that he can't have <em>outside</em> foods, so he's eating <em>inside</em> foods instead.
</li><li> In "Robot of Furfuri Nagar", the contestants of the robot competition are asked to read the robots' manuals, as "whoever drinks up the information in this manual tonight and digests it really well, only he will be able to win the competition". Motu complies by <em>turning his manual into a soup and literally drinking it</em>.

When Grany Dao Yang asks to go to the bathroom because he has a stomachache, the wolves refuse to let him go since they think he might be trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BathroomBreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BathroomBreakOut">escape their prison</a>. When Grany Dao Yang changes his request so that he has to go to the bathroom because his foot hurts, the wolves open the gate for him since they were never told that they couldn't let them go to the bathroom because their feet hurt.

<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildBallads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildBallads">Child Ballad</a> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfLornAndTheFalseSteward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfLornAndTheFalseSteward">The Lord of Lorn and the False Steward</a>", the hero had promise not to tell the truth to anyone. When the heroine overheard him lamenting his fate to a horse, she asked him to tell her; he refused, she sat down on the hay and told him to ignore her and go on telling the horse, and he did so.
</li><li> In one folk song, the two characters are in love with each other, but the woman's father has made her promise to say "No" to any request a would-be suitor makes of her. Once the man realises this, he asks her to <em>refuse to</em> date him, and she gladly denies this request, thus agreeing to date.
</li><li> The sea song <em>Paddy West</em> is about a "sailing school" in which neophyte sailors do such things as walk around a bullock's head (thus going "around the Horn") and step over a rope on the ground ("crossing the Line") in order to claim experience to potential employers with a straight face.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> runs on this trope.
<ul><li> Indestructible permanents can't be destroyed... but they can still be exiled (a stronger effect that pushes the card into the 'exile zone', outside the normal game<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1986u');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1986u" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1986u');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">it used to be called "removed from the game" until that term proved to be both too cumbersome and somewhat inaccurate</span>), bounced back into the player's hand, and (in the case of creatures) weakened with minus effects applied to toughness enough to die on their own. Hexproof creatures can't be targeted by spells or abilities an opponent controls... but their controller may be forced to sacrifice them, or an effect may be untargeted, affecting all creatures on the battlefield indiscrimiately.
</li><li> Similarly, there are effects that deal damage and those that cause loss of life. An effect protecting from damage won't help against loss of life. There are also effects that reduce a creature's stats, potentially even fatally, but these aren't considered to be damage and so won't activate corresponding effects like deathtouch.
</li><li> Many rules depend on <em>exactly</em> how things are worded, and slight changes will completely ruin the effect of the card. One notorious example is "Substance", an ability whose only reason for existing was to cheat around the significant length of time between "<em>at</em> end of turn" and "<em>until</em> end of turn," and certain cards <em>really needed</em> the second one.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note274nz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note274nz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note274nz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The problem here was that these cards were creature enchantments that could be played at instant speed, but if you did, they were sacrificed at the end of the turn. The idea was that you could use them to "save" a creature that was about to die, at the cost of the permanent benefit of the enchantment. However, the timing difference was crucial: If the card is sacrificed "at end of turn," the creature hasn't had its damage removed yet, so the effect of saving the creature is rendered moot. The fix was to say, essentially, "This has Substance until end of turn; when it loses Substance, sacrifice this." "Until end of turn" effects resolve at the actual, literal end of the turn, and the creature has had its damage removed by then. This no longer exists; as of the June 2009 rules overhaul, a special "at the beginning of the next cleanup step" trigger is used for these cards, which has (close enough to) the same timing as "until end of turn".</span>
</li><li> Many, many of the creative combos (most of which are tournament-winning level ones) and lockdowns are result of this and lack of creator's foresight. <a class="urllink" href="http://magiccards.info/query?q=Myr+Superion&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname">Myr Superion<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a card that was meant to be cast with mana generated from normal myrs, as that's what they're best known for. However its only restriction is that the mana used to pay its cost has to come from creatures. <a class="urllink" href="http://magiccards.info/query?q=Heartless+Summoning&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname">If you reduce its cost to zero<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, you don't need any creatures to play it.
</li><li> In early playtesting, one card had the effect "Opponent loses next turn". While the <em>intention</em> was that the opponent's next turn is skipped, many players instead interpreted it as "Opponent loses <em>the game</em> next turn". As a result, the <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=728">actual printed card<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> instead reads "Take an extra turn after this one."
<ul><li> Perhaps inspired by the above, there's another card with the effect "Take an extra turn after this one. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack">You lose the game at the end of that turn.</a>" This needed errata to specifically state that you don't lose if you've already won, to prevent people from interpreting it as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">causing the caster to lose even if they ended the turn by winning the game</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Unglued (joke set) card "<a class="urllink" href="http://magiccards.info/query?q=Chaos+Confetti&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname">Chaos Confetti<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" was inspired by an infamous incident at a tournament involving the card "<a class="urllink" href="http://magiccards.info/query?q=Chaos+Orb&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname">Chaos Orb<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>". You see, Chaos Orb's text declares: "If Chaos Orb is on the battlefield, flip Chaos Orb onto the battlefield from a height of at least one foot. If Chaos Orb turns over completely at least once during the flip, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TouchOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TouchOfDeath">destroy all nontoken permanents it touches</a>. Then destroy Chaos Orb." So the player in question <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">tore up the card</a>, and tossed the now-multiple pieces of it onto the field. The judge ruled it as valid at the time because <em>technically</em> they were indeed touching Chaos Orb... thus inspiring the "Confetti" card, which does almost the exact same thing but <em>requires</em> you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">tear it up in the process</a>.
<ul><li> And on that note, Chaos Orb itself's Exact Words have proven so problematic that its text got errata'd to refer to only Permanents, it's gotten banned in all tournament formats, <em>and</em> it gained multiple rulings (all of which were garnered on <em>the same date</em>), including:
</li><li> "Cards that are in the game but not on the battlefield, such as those in the Library and Graveyard, can't be affected."
</li><li> "You can arrange your cards any time before the Orb is put onto the battlefield, but not after. "
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious">It must flip 360 degrees (that's what "flip" means)</a>. And this flip must be in the air and not in your hand."
</li><li> "This is not a targeted ability."
</li><li> And "If you have sleeves on cards, they count as the cards."
</li><li> To which one player suggested: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer">So put your Chaos Orb deck in</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">really big sleeves</a></em>..."
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> There are several examples from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>:
<ul><li> An interesting side-effect of Equip Spell Cards that give Piercing is that you can inflict damage to your opponent by equipping them to your opponent's monster(s). Then, when your opponent attacks one of your Defense Position monsters with an ATK greater than your monster's DEF, he/she will take the difference. After all, even though it's your opponent's monster, it's <strong>your</strong> Spell Card, and thus it's your opponent — not <em>you</em> — who takes the extra damage, due to the wording on the cards.
</li><li> Some continuous card effects have linkage to another monster card, such as <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Future_Fusion">Future Fusion<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Call_of_the_Haunted">Call of the Haunted<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. However, when the monster is removed from the field other than being destroyed, the continuous effect card remains on the field meaninglessly. Those hinder the user more than helping them but not so with <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Premature_Burial">Premature Burial<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Its text states that when it is <strong>destroyed</strong>, destroy the equipped monster<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3iujm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3iujm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3iujm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">If you return it to your hand, it isn't destroyed, so the revived monster stays on the field and you can play the card again on your next turn. And the next... and the next..</span>. <em>That card</em> is the primary offender, so much so that it's been banned in tournament play.
</li><li> Another card that deserves special mention is <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Question">Question<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The card states that the opposing player must remember the name of the first monster card on the bottom of his/her opponent's graveyard or it gets special summoned to the field. This was fairly jarring if your opponent enforced including prefixes, such as if the monster's card name began with "The" (like many a Six Samurai deck) or enforces his/her own specific pronunciation of the card's name.
</li><li> A common mistake most beginners make is the difference between "destroying" a card and "negating" a card. The former simply means the card no longer exists on the field, the latter means its effects are stopped until the negating effect ends. This means that playing something like Mystical Space Typhoon on an activated spell/trap card with the same or lower spell speed is meaningless, as its effect is already in motion and it would go to the graveyard regardless anyways. Likewise, simply negating the effect of a continuous card without destroying it is moot, as the effect would resume as soon as the negation card is gone.
</li><li> There's a card called "Yu-Jo Friendship". When activated, you offer a handshake to your opponent. The effects of the card are dependent on whether or not the opponent accepts the handshake, but you can reveal a "Unity" card in your hand to your opponent, and then they must "accept the handshake". It doesn't say to apply the one specific effect, just that they must accept the handshake. So one player, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">after using this card</a>, stuck his hand down his pants, and then showed Unity to force a handshake. His opponent wisely chose to forfeit rather than to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">shake that hand</a>.
<ul><li> Of course, the opponent could have instead called over a judge and gotten the player penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct.
</li></ul></li><li> Not to mention the card doesn't even say that you have to shake your opponent's hand. It says your opponent must accept the handshake. A player could say "I accept the handshake" without shaking the hand.
</li><li> One of the main reasons <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Number_50:_Blackship_of_Corn">Blackship of Corn<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is popular: its effect doesn't say to "destroy" the target monster, but to "send it to the Graveyard". Cards that are destroyed go to the Graveyard, so what's the difference? Many monsters have effects saying either that they "cannot be <em>destroyed</em> by card effects", or that "when this card is <em>destroyed</em> by a card effect, do X", and many such similar cases. Due to the wording on Blackship's effect, it bypasses all of that since the card isn't technically being "destroyed".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>: Certain moves like Selfdestruct <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4gb5i');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4gb5i" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4gb5i');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which, in the mainline video games, has obscenely high power but causes the user to faint</span> don't tell you to remove the card as if it had fainted, but to put as many damage counters on it as it has HP. As seen in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy">Game Boy</a> version, this means that you can use a Defender card to remove two of those damage counters, allowing the card to remain in play for at least one more turn. This one got foreseen, as some Pokémon with Selfdestruct, Explosion, etc. do damage to themselves <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">greater than</a></em> their HP, and other self-sacrificial moves skip the self-damage and <em>do</em> outright state that the user is Knocked Out.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Munchkin">Munchkin</a> has had to do this a few times, since it's a game with a sizable player base of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer">rules lawyers</a>.
<ul><li> Errata for the Plutonium Dragon had to say that "You are roasted and eaten" meant that you were dead.
</li><li> A famous instance came from people using "Go Up a Level" cards to make their opponents gain a level, since there was no rule saying you had to use the level-up card on yourself, thereby forcing the other player to fight a monster they could have otherwise escaped from. The developers said that it was "a very Munchkin-y thing to do," and decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn">leave it in the game, unpatched</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SentinelsOfTheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SentinelsOfTheMultiverse">Sentinels of the Multiverse</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the lore, Wager Master is vulnerable to this. The Scholar once got shot of him by offering a deal of "take my Philosopher's Stone and go away". WM stuck with this deal even though the Scholar summoned the Stone back two minutes later.
</li><li> There are also plenty of mechanical interactions that qualify, such as the Jack Handle equipment for Mr Fixer turning all damage he deals into barrages of outgoing damage aimed at all the bad guys...including damage he would cause to himself or other heroes.
</li><li> Anything that just says "target" doesn't care about side. This allows Absolute Zero to use some of his attacks on himself to heal up, or allows heroes to trigger Kaargra Warfang's titles or shift their health to trigger a specific Wager Master card by hitting each other.
</li><li> Luminary has a card that lets him blow up devices and ongoings to draw up. This includes villainous devices (most of which, to be fair, he built in the first place).
</li><li> Some villains counterattack anyone who damages them. Including themselves. This makes redirection effects hilarious against, say, the Chairman or Greazer Clutch.
</li><li> Nemesis symbols <em>always</em> boost damage regardless of what side the targets are on: for example, the Ennead share Ra's nemesis icon and so will deal bonus damage to each other.
</li><li> Legacy's Take Down card specifies that it will damage him at the end of <em>his</em> turn, so it becomes harmless to him yet still fully effective if played on someone else's. There are several ways to abuse this. One of them is an infinite combo that can lock a villain deck indefinitely.

<ul><li> In a comic, the company is at thirty dollars a share when Dogbert offers to buy them, but their value promptly falls. Dogbert then offers to pay "the full thirty dollars" for their stock. They ended up selling him the entire stock for thirty dollars and not thirty dollars <em>per share</em>.
</li><li> Dogbert does this a lot. At one point he ran an investment firm, and promised clients that if they let him manage their investments, they could one day own "this", said while holding up a photo of a mansion.

<ul><li> For example:
<div class="indent"><em>(Peter is doing the dishes)</em> <br/><strong>Peter:</strong> It's unbelievable how much homework I have to do tonight! I can't remember the last time I had this many things due! I don't know <em>what</em> all my teachers were thinking! <br/><strong>Andy:</strong> In that case, Sweetie, why don't I do the dishes? <br/><em>(later on)</em> <br/><strong>Jason:</strong> I thought you had <em>no</em> homework... <br/><strong>Peter:</strong> It's all in how you say it.
</div></li><li> Jason asks his mom if he can keep playing a driving game for a sec. He later clarifies that he meant <em>a parsec</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0n3fu');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0n3fu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0n3fu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Seeing as a parsec is a unit of <em>distance</em>, not time, he's <em>really</em> grasping at straws, thought it is a driving game, so...</span>. Obviously this doesn't work.
</li><li> Andy discovers that a plate of fresh cookies was missing, and she asks Paige if she's <em>seen</em> what happened to them. Paige calls back that no, she hasn't. Cut to her and Jason, eating cookies while wearing blindfolds and Jason saying that he had been wondering why they had to wear them.
</li><li> Those instances where Andy tells the kids they can have <em>one</em> piece of candy, or <em>one</em> scoop of ice-cream... Jason has melted all his candy to form one giant piece, Paige manages to take the entire tub of ice-cream out in one scoop. Really, the kids are <em>amazing</em> at this.
</li><li> Peter gets this probably even more since he's the Stomach of the family. For example, Andy said he could eat "the last doughnut"; he eats the full box to find out "which one." Another time, he tries to eat a pan of brownies which is, at that point, <em>technically</em> one brownie. Andy catches him that time.
</li><li> Some other examples: Peter and Jason saying they ate one slice of pizza apiece: a large pizza cut in half. Another is Paige asking if she can have a banana as a pre-dinner snack. She eats half a loaf of banana-chocolate chip bread to get to the banana.
</li><li> Andy catches Peter when he mentions he's halfway done with his summer reading list. She realizes correctly he means he's halfway through reading the list, not halfway through reading the books on the list.
</li><li> Jason allows Peter to go see the film <em>Thor</em> with them for the weekend (even though he's only going to see it for Natalie Portman), although under the condition that he dress up as Thor for the movie like themselves. Peter then asks what qualifies as wearing a Thor costume. It then cuts to them on the sidewalk with Jason and Marcus wearing Thor helmets, a long blond wig, and Thor's hammer with Peter wearing an outrageous costume that is composed of a Philadelphia Eagles helmet, a utility hammer, and a curly blond clown's wig, with Peter saying "What?! You said a hammer, a blond wig, and a helmet with wings!" to an embarrassed Jason and a shocked Marcus when about to enter the car.
</li><li> Still another strip has this:
<div class="indent"><strong>Andy</strong>: Jason, I thought I told you to turn that off at 8:00! <br/><strong>Jason</strong>: Okay, mom. <br/>(Jason turns the TV off with his remote, then turns it back on a second later) <br/><strong>Andy</strong>: What did I tell you? <br/><strong>Jason</strong>: It's 8:01 now.
</div></li><li> And another has Andy ask Paige how she did on her test, and Paige responding, "Infinitely better than I expected." In the final panel, she reveals that the trick is to expect a zero, since any positive number would be an infinite percentage greater than 0. Peter says he should try that some time.

</li><li> Michael was saving up his allowance for a pair of roller skates. He ended up spending the money he had saved up to that point, and when he told Elly, she just said, "Money seems to burn a hole in your pockets." Cue Michael and Elizabeth fearfully checking his pockets to make sure they were all right.
</li><li> During supper, Elly suspiciously asked Michael if he was feeding Farley under the table. Michael said he wasn't. He was actually feeding Farley by surreptitiously tossing food scraps behind his chair.

<ul><li> Common in meta-jokes, including why the chicken crossed the road.
</li><li> A riddle you may have heard in elementary school: "Can you stick out your tongue and touch your nose/forehead/ear?" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The answer is yes. The trick is that the wording doesn't specify whether you're meant to touch your nose/forehead/ear <em>with</em> your tongue.</span>
</li><li> Somewhat related: can you make 35 cents with only two coins, one of which isn't a quarter? (Yes: the <em>other</em> one is.)
</li><li> Another; can you jump higher than a house? Yes; a house can't jump.
</li><li> And another: can you stand on one finger? Sure: just stick out one of your fingers, put it on the ground, and stand on top of it with your foot.
</li><li> An old Russian joke/urban legend: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockCharacters">Rabinovich the cynical old Jew</a> applies to the Soviet government for permission to emigrate to Israel.
<div class="indent"><strong>MVD Official:</strong> You say you have no relatives abroad, but that you also have a brother in Israel? <br/><strong>Rabinovich:</strong> Yes, but <em>I</em> am abroad, <em>he</em> is at home!
</div></li><li> A very rich man dies, and demands that he be buried with his entire fortune (9,450,356 dollars and 39 cents). On the day of the funeral, people are surprised to see the normal-sized coffin, and demand an explanation from the widow. She replies that his last wishes were obeyed: His coffin contains a check for 9,450,356 dollars and 39 cents.
<ul><li> There's a variation where the man gives his doctor, his minister and his lawyer each the same amount and asks them to toss it in his grave. At the funeral all three toss envelopes in his grave. The minister admits to the other two he used part to pay for a new roof for the church, the doctor admits he used some to buy an X-Ray for the hospital, while the lawyer says he is ashamed of both of them, as he followed the instructions and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLawyerJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLawyerJoke">put a check for the full amount in the envelope</a>.
</li><li> It should be noted that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw">Artistic License  Law</a> is in effect here: A check merely certifies its bearer's <em>right</em> to receive a certain amount of money from a designated bank account. The money doesn't even become his property until <em>after</em> he submits it to the bank.
</li></ul></li><li> This joke:
<div class="indent"><strong>Dad:</strong> Son, I told you not to eat the cookies before dinner.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Son:</strong> I didn't touch one of them, Dad.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Dad:</strong> But there's only one left.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Son:</strong> That's the one I didn't touch.
</div></li><li> One joke has someone boasting that they can lift an elephant with one hand. When challenged, the boaster replies, "Well, find me an elephant with one hand and I'll lift it!"
</li><li> Another joke has a man boasting that he could "carry a mountain across the town on his back". When challenged, he asks for the mountain to be placed on his back, because he only said could <em>carry</em> the mountain, not <em>lift</em> it himself.
</li><li> Yet another joke has a man boasting that he could "drink all the water in the river". When challenged, he promptly takes water in a glass, walks into the river, and drinks the glass of water, thus drinking <em>all</em> the water <em>in</em> the river.
</li><li> A man is reading the classifieds (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">or Craigslist, depending on when the joke is set</a>) and sees a notice announcing an almost brand-new Porsche on sale for twenty dollars. Thinking it's a trick, he goes to the address in the ad—a large mansion—and meets a wealthy middle-aged woman who takes him to the garage, where the newest model of Porsche is waiting. The man goes for a test drive, and finds that the car works perfectly. When he gets back, he takes a twenty from his wallet and hands it to the woman, but he can't resist asking why she's selling such an expensive car so cheap. The rich woman explains that her husband recently ran off with his secretary, and sent her a message from Europe telling her to "sell the Porsche and send me the money"—which means he neglected to tell her how much to <em>charge</em> for the Porsche.
</li><li> There's a joke about a man who tells a new acquaintance how he divorced his wife because she was having an affair with a man who worked as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoofySuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoofySuit">a Disneyland mascot</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Old Friend:</strong> I thought you divorced her because she was crazy. <br/><strong>Divorcee:</strong> I didn't say she was crazy, I said she was fucking Goofy!
</div></li><li> One day, a cop pulls a van over, and when he walks up to the window, he sees ten penguins in the back. The cop asks the man, "Are those your penguins?" The man says, "Yes, they are mine." The cop says, "You need to take them to the zoo right now." So the man agrees and drives off. The next day, the cop pulls over the same van, walks up to the window, and sees the ten penguins again. The cop says to the man, "I thought I told you to take those penguins to the zoo." The man says, "I did! Today we're going to the movies!"

</div><div class="indent"><strong>Visitor:</strong> Could you please tell me where the Harvard Library is at, asshole?
</div></li><li> Canadian government offices are required to offer service in both English and French.

After all, he had only asked for <em>service</em> in French; he never claimed to speak or understand French himself.

<ul><li> Both of Mulaney's parents are lawyers and he has quite a few bits about how this made him and his siblings learn how to say things exactly the right way to get anywhere with them. One time they were on a road trip and all four of the kids were getting rowdy because they were hungry. Mr. Mulaney didnt want to stop because they were almost there. They saw a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds">McDonald's</a> and started chanting McDonalds! over and over.

John admits this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny">Actually Pretty Funny</a>.
</li><li> One routine from the special <em>Kid Gorgeous</em> has John explain that unlike some comedians, he would never make jokes about how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulWeddedLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulWeddedLife">his wife is a bitch and he hates her</a>. He then goes on to say "My wife is a bitch, and I like her <em>so much</em>!"

A local aristocratic woman writes a letter to the captain, requesting to send her a dozen well-behaved men for a ball she's throwing for the young ladies in her boarding house. But no Jews. At the appointed hour, she opens the door and sees a dozen black guys in uniform. The shocked woman says, "There must be some mistake!" One of the sailors replies, "Madam, Captain Rabinowitz is never mistaken."

</li><li> There's one Dutch song by the group Kadril, "Het Heerke van Maldegem" (the lordling of Maldegem). The song tells the story of the main character, who goes out hunting and instead of game finds a group of robbers, who organise a party and make him pay for the booze. He asks them to let him go, and in exchange promises not to speak to anyone about them. When they agree, he goes on to Bruges and writes down what happened to him and where the robbers are, making his original hunt successful.
</li><li> In 2008, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BiffyClyro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BiffyClyro">Biffy Clyro</a> performed an acoustic cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RageAgainstTheMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RageAgainstTheMachine">Rage Against the Machine</a>'s "Killing In The Name" at the Reading Festival. Since the performance was being broadcast live over BBC Radio, the band agreed that they would censor the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb">Cluster F-Bomb</a> at the song's climax. The <em>audience</em>, however, were bound by no such agreement, and happily filled in the blanks.
<ul><li> Robbie Williams pulled the exact same trick when he performed at the BBC's annual New Years' concert to ring in 2017. He told the audience that, before the concert, the Beeb had pulled him to one side and told him not to swear during any of his songs: he then noted that there was nothing stopping the audience from swearing, before launching into a rendition of "Come Undone" during which the audience happily swore in his stead. He later told the audience a story about his young daughter innocently dropping an F-bomb, which also counts as this: he'd only been told not to swear during his <em>songs</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> "Changeling Child" by Heather Dale tells the story of a woman who bargains with the faeries for a baby. They give her exactly what she asked for:
<div class="indent">"But soon they saw the years that passed

</div></li><li> Pete Best just can't resist making puns on his name and famous former occupation. In 1965, for example, he released an original album called <em>Best of the Beatles</em>. As in, <em>Pete</em> Best, <em>formerly</em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>.
<ul><li> This is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> to the Beatles' early days, when the compere of the Cavern Club always described it as "the best of cellars".

<ul><li> Even the gods fall for this one occasionally. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a>, Loki, the God of Mischief, made a bet with the dwarf Brokk; the bet was for his head, which at the time meant "the sum that your head is worth" (i.e. to ransom himself). When he lost, it turned out that Brokk wanted his head — literally — due to his cheating over the wager, but still losing. Loki, being who he is, still managed to turn the tables, however, by pulling some Exact Words right back: "My <em>head</em> may be yours, but my <em>neck</em> is not." Hence, Brokk couldn't decapitate him to "claim his prize" because they couldn't manage to define which part of Loki was his head and which was his neck. Brokk still got the last word, however, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MouthStitchedShut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MouthStitchedShut">sewed Loki's mouth shut</a> to keep him from performing any more trickery, hence one of his nicknames, Loki Scar-lip.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Greek Mythology</a>:
<ul><li> Apollo offered Sibyl her fondest wish if she agreed to sleep with him. She held up a handful of sand and asked to live for as many years as there were grains of sand in her hand. Apollo agreed but Sibyl still refused him. In response, Apollo cursed her by giving her the years she desired... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeWithoutYouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeWithoutYouth">but she would not be eternally youthful.</a> After a few hundred years, she became a shriveled gnome.
<ul><li> Eos of the dawn once fell in love with a mortal and asked for him to be immortal... but this only resulted in him shrivelling into a grasshopper or cicada, as she forgot the youth. When Selene, Eos' sister was in a similar situation, she asked for her lover to remain the way he was when she first saw him forever, forgetting that she is the titaness of the moon, so Endymion was asleep at the time.
</li></ul></li><li> When Icarius' daughter Erigone was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a> by hanging, she or Dionysus cursed the maidens of Athens to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism">swing</a>" as she had. To save their children, the Athenians developed the Aiora rite, in which young women literally swung from the trees... safely, on rope swings.
</li><li> A seer said that Psyche's mysterious betrothed "is a monster whom neither gods or men can resist". She was not speaking <em>literally</em>; Cupid is mostly human (except for his gorgeous angelic wings), attractive, and compassionate. He's a monster in the sense that he's the god of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveHurts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveHurts">love</a>. (As for the second part of the prophecy...she never said that gods or men would <em>want</em> to resist him in the first place, did she?)
</li><li> When Thetys, the beautiful nereid, got to marriage age, a prophecy said her child will be more powerful than the father. Wanting to avoid the fate of his own father, Zeus with the agreement of the other gods hitches her with a mortal - since she is a goddess, the child would be a demigod, which would mean the child would be stronger than the father by definition.
</li></ul></li><li> According to the Quran, Iblis, the Islamic equivalent of the Devil, fell from grace after falling foul of this trope. When Allah made a prophecy that one of his most devoted servants would rebel against him, the Angels were greatly troubled and begged Iblis, one of the Djinn, to speak to Allah on their behalf; Iblis, who was loyal to Allah at the time, made Allah swear a promise that none of the Angels would be forced out of Allah's service. When the Angels and Djinn were commanded to bow before Allah's third creation, Adam, Iblis arrogantly objected, and was cursed for his disobedience; Allah had made no mention of Iblis or any of the Djinn in his promise.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> tells Abraham to bring his son Isaac up to the mountain and offer him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice">Human Sacrifice</a>. That, it turns out, is all God wants—Isaac <em>offered</em> as a sacrifice. Once it's clear that the two have enough faith to go through with the killing, God sends an angel to stop it from actually taking place. (Abraham then spots a ram stuck in a nearby bush and sacrifices <em>that</em> to prove his seriousness—and possibly to get some mutton for his trouble. We don't know what happened to the ram, exactly.)
<ul><li> In some versions of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">Biblical</a> story of Jacob, this is pulled by Laban. Jacob was in love with Laban's daughter Rachel, and asked her father for her hand in marriage. Jacob couldn't produce the normal bride-price for Rachel, though, so Laban told him that he could work for him for seven years instead and afterwards, Jacob could marry his daughter. However, Laban had <em>two</em> daughters, and he never specified which one Jacob would marry, leaving Jacob with Rachel's sister Leah as his wife.
<ul><li> As the story continues, Jacob then worked <em>another</em> seven-years so that he could finally marry Rachel.
</li></ul></li><li> Elisha served this up with a side of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist">Prophecy Twist</a> in II Kings 8:7-15. A lot of translators have trouble with 8:10 because the Hebrew seems ambiguous, instructing Hazael either to lie or tell the truth to his master King Ben-Hadad about whether he'd recover from his illness. However, as the story goes on to reveal, what the prophecy really meant was "Tell him his illness won't kill him, although I'm telling you he's going to die anyway." Taking his cue from a further prophecy that he would soon be the new King, Hazael returned to Ben-Hadad and told him Elisha had promised he would recover; but the next day, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">cured Ben-Hadad of his illness</a> <em>once and for all</em> by suffocating him with a washcloth. Then he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">seized the throne</a> for himself.
</li><li> Jesus pulls a particularly effective one in Luke 20:25 when challenged by his opponents to take a stand on whether the Jews should pay taxes to the Romans. This <em>should</em> have put him on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">Morton's Fork</a>: say yes, and his detractors could frame him for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs">boot-licking Roman collaborator</a>; say no, and either Pontius Pilate or Herod Antipas would have to have him arrested for preaching sedition against Rome. However, "He said to them, 'Then give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's.'" Arguably, since he was pointing to a coin with Caesar's image on it at the time, that does amount to saying "Pay <em>this</em> tax." What he didn't actually say is what—other than the coin used in paying this particular tax—rightfully belongs to Caesar. People in the audience wouldn't have automatically assumed that <em>anything</em> they had rightfully belonged to a foreign pagan occupier such as Rome. Thus, no patriotic Roman listener could honestly claim Jesus had told anyone not to pay taxes, and no loyal Jew (even the Zealots, who were violently anti-Roman hardliners) could claim that Jesus had told them they had to pay <em>any</em> and <em>every</em> tax Rome might think to levy on them.
</li><li> "The wages of sin are death" which means just about every human on Earth will die. But there's no rule saying that humans right with God cannot be <em>brought back to life</em>, afterwards, by Him.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the origin stories of the Red Hand of Ulster, the symbol of the Irish province of Ulster, is said to be the result of this trope. The story goes that the Kingdom of Ulster was without an heir, so a boat race was held so that "whosoever's hand is the first to touch the shore of Ireland, so shall he be made the king". As one potential king was losing, he made use of this trope by cutting his right hand off and tossing the blood-soaked hand ashore. As his hand was the first to touch the shore, he was awarded the crown.
</li><li> King Conchobar of Ulster was honorbound to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroitDuSeigneur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroitDuSeigneur">be the first man to sleep with any woman</a> in his province on her wedding night<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note64vze');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note64vze" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note64vze');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In contrast to most examples of droit du seigneur, this was started by the populace as a means of "blessing" their new marriage.</span>. One of these women he was obliged to sleep with was Emer, newlywed wife of Conchobhar's <em>very</em> tempermental and deadly nephew (or grandson; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">the myths vary</a>) Cu Chulainn. Thus, Conchobor chose to interpret his obligation as literally as possible.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Jupiter</a> must have been in a bloodthirsty mood when Numa Pompilius, 2nd king of Rome, asked him how to "atone" a place hit by his lightning. Jupiter asked for a head. Numa said, "OK, head of an onion." Jupiter then further asked for a body part. Numa said, "OK, my cut off nails." Jupiter then further asked for something alive. Numa said, "OK, a small fish." Jupiter said something that's probably unprintable, but the deal stuck. (Sidenote: Numa's concubine was a demigoddess, it's not recommended for YOU to play silly bugger with Roman deities.)
</li><li> Also from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Roman sagas</a>; <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarpeia">Tarpeia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> once offered to open the gates of Rome to the Sabines, who were besieging Rome at the time, in exchange for "what they bore on their left arms." She was referring to the gold bracelets the Sabines wore, but they instead threw their shields — normally carried on the left arm — on top of her, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewardedAsATraitorDeserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewardedAsATraitorDeserves">crushing her to death</a>. Then they threw her body off a cliff.
</li><li> One ancient Roman myth details the founding of a city in an outpost of the empire. The occupants of the territory, angry at the intrusion, give the Romans a single cowhide and tell them that they're entitled to as much land as the skin can cover. After thinking about this, the Romans tear the cowhide into small pieces and scatter them across a huge field, allowing the group to build an enormous city—after all, they covered the ground with the skin, just as requested.

When he used them against Queen Maeve's army, they all missed, because there were no kings there. When they were thrown back, the first hit Laeg, considered a king among charioteers; the second hit Lia Macha, king among horses; and the third hit Cúchulainn himself, who was king of warriors.

</li><li> In the legend of Tristan and Isolde, in order to discover if Isolde was having an affair with Tristan, she was forced into a ritual where she would swear and grab a hot iron, which would burn her if lying. She swore that the only men who had ever been between her legs were her husband and the peasant who carried her across the river, who tripped and accidentally landed with his head between her legs. She was telling the truth and thus the iron didn't burn her. She just didn't mention that the peasant was Tristan in disguise.
</li><li> In one of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AesopsFables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AesopsFables">Aesop's Fables</a></em>, two boys enter a butcher shop. One snatches an expensive piece of meat, then passes it to the other boy behind his back. When the butcher discovers the theft, the boys defend themselves using this trope: the one who stole it doesn't have it, and the one who has it didn't steal it. Since the butcher can't technically prove the theft, he can't bring the law on the boys. In a subversion, though, he warns them that while <em>human</em> law is subject to exact wording, the law of the gods is not, and the deities will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">see through the trick and punish the boys severely</a>.
</li><li> In an ancient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend">Urban Legend</a>, a man entrusts his property to another while he's away, with the promise, once he returns, to give him back as much as he wishes. Upon the man's return, the other guy only gives him back a small amount, which he finds unfair, so he goes to the court. The judge states that the second man, as promised, is to give back as much as he wished... for himself.

Eventually, when the combatants fought their way to the stage, Triple H came out and hit Big Show with a sledgehammer to knock him out. Vickie reprimanded Triple H for violating her orders, but he pointed out the stage is nowhere near ringside and she grudgingly accepted it.

Promising his ancient enemies of House Kurita that "No Federated Commonwealth units would cross their borders" until the Clan invasion was dealt with, he found out soon after that House Kurita was on the verge of a catastrophic defeat. For a moment, it looks like Hanse, a man known as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CunningLikeAFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CunningLikeAFox">The Fox</a>", is up to something, and he is. He sends <em>mercenary</em> units across the border straight to the Combine homeworld. At first, several Combine high officers are furious, thinking they have been betrayed. This is quickly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inverted</a> when the mercenaries reveal that Davion has hired them to <em>defend</em> Luthien, not attack it as the Combine officers expected from Davion's Exact Words. By employing mercenaries rather than his own Federated Commonwealth forces, he stays true to his promise while also keeping the Combine from falling...so that he can use the Combine as a buffer zone between his realm and the invading Clans. There's a reason Hanse Davion is considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a>.
<ul><li> This is done against the Federated Commonwealth as well, when their long-time enemy, the Capellan Confederation, sends an agent to deal with the Northwind Highlanders, a mercenary unit that had been long loyal to the Confederation until an offer was made during the Fourth Succession War to grant them their ancestral home world of Northwind in exchange for defecting to the then-Federated Suns. Thirty years later, the Confederation's current ruler, Sun-Tzu Liao, sends a member of his elite special forces with Highlander ancestry on a mission to 'neutralize the Northwind Highlanders'. The agent, at first, believes that his orders mean for him to cause the destruction of the mercenaries. However, the Highlanders are struggling to fend off the Federated Commonwealth's liasons, who are trying to ensnare the Highlanders using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanyTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanyTown">company store tactics</a>. The agent ends up defecting to the Highlanders, but the mistreatment from the Commonwealth's liasons cause the Highlanders to declare independence, thus 'neutralizing' them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">as Sun-Tzu ordered.</a>

<ul><li> This is often considered the real reason players avoid casting <em>Wish</em>, as many DMs invoke this trope with its use. This is partially averted by kinder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">DMs</a> and in the computer adaptation, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateII">Baldur's Gate II</a></em>, by allowing characters with high wisdom and intelligence scores to close the more obvious loopholes if the wish is otherwise reasonable. Some sources indicate this as one of the advantages the clerical counterpart Miracle has over Wish — because it is not so much a wish as a requested miracle, it can be vetoed by your deity... but it also means that it will tend to be interpreted in your favour, whereas Wish includes a little comment about, if one goes beyond the list it has and requests a greater effect, there is danger of a literal but undesired fulfillment (that is, this trope) or partial fulfillment.
</li><li> One sourcebook suggests this as a way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePaladin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePaladin">The Paladin</a> can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> without being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">Lawful Stupid</a>. In the specific example given, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePaladin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePaladin">The Paladin</a> is honor-bound to follow the requests of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>: When the villain says "Bring me the head of the king", the paladin brings him the head... along with the rest of the king, and his entire army.
</li><li> This can be a way to beat truth-telling magic, depending on the edition and the spell — one book has a fallen paladin observe that very few truth-telling spells can tell a lie fashioned by putting two truthful sentences next to one another (in the case that prompted this observation, he had managed to give the impression that his dead niece had been responsible for summoning a fiend by saying there'd been a summoning gone awry by a foolish mage, and then adding that fortunately his (dead in the incident) niece had taken precautions in case something went awry like that. Not his fault if the one he was speaking to thought the foolish mage was the niece rather than the paladin himself).
</li><li> In the adventure book <em>Three Days to Kill</em>, the players are hired to wipe out the head of a thieves' guild, and assured that the town watch would be very grateful to have the guild become disorganized. This is quite true, but the person hiring them didn't say he worked for the town watch.. he works for an opposing thieves' guild. Technically, the players are still doing something good, and the person hiring them doesn't backstab them (as they might expect), so it's just an additional secret they might find.
</li><li> The <em>Plane Shift</em> spell allows you to specify a location you wish to arrive at on the plane you're travelling to. The rules note that if you wanted to go to a certain city, for example, the spell might deposit you outside its gates, right in the middle of its high street, or on top of a cliff gazing out at it from fifty miles away.

He meant "now" as in "at the present moment", not dismissing the possibility of future friendship. After the misunderstanding is cleared up, the Realm emissary agrees that indeed their nations are not friends "now".

<ul><li> On the other hand, this used to trip up Laurence, Archangel of The Sword, in his early days as Commander of The Host. Angels of The Sword must obey both the spirit and the letter of Laurence's orders, and when his commands were too detailed, the servitors were left with no way to adjust for conditions without earning dissonance.
<div class="indent">"Thus, Laurence will not tell a Servitor 'Take Highway 41 to Tifton, Georgia, find the Tether of Death just south of there, and bring me the Seneschals head.' Such specific orders could result in all kinds of dissonance  what if the angel knows a more efficient way of traveling to Tifton (or Highway 41 is washed out)? What if Laurences intelligence is flawed, and the Tether is north of Tifton, or its actually a Tether to Dark Humor? What if the Seneschal has been destroyed already  should the Tether be left intact? What if the Seneschal wants to redeem? What if the angel can only kill the Seneschal by some means which wont leave an intact head to bring to Laurence? Scenarios like this came back to bite the young Archangel of the Sword, until he learned to loosen his control  a little." — <em>Superiors 1: War and Honor</em>

There is a running joke that he has yet to discover the correct wording to obtain an ice cream: "I wish I had an ice cream" makes "Chuubo has an ice cream" a law of reality, meaning that he can't eat the ice cream, because he would then no longer have it.

What Usirian didn't say was that no soul is ever created equal; they can be extremely similar but each would be microscopically different on some level. Thus, Apophas is forever enslaved to Usirian as he can never fulfill his end of the bargain.

A strict reading of the decree does not support a ban on black powder firearms but the decree hasn't been updated to include them and since a handgun can kill a knight just as readily as a crossbow can, including them is in the spirit of the law.

<ul><li> During the War of the Beasts, the Imperial Fist Chapter was utterly destroyed to a man, with the Chaptermaster himself dying on an assault against the titular beast. However, just before the fateful assault, the Imperial Fist Chaptermaster had called all the Imperial Fist successor chapters together under a decree made by their primarch, Rogal Dorn, that would reform the Imperial Fist Legion in times of crisis to protect the Imperium. As the decree was still active at the time the Chaptermaster died, the gathered successor chapters deemed that, for the moment, they were all Imperial Fists and so even if the last actual Imperial Fist marine died, the chapter technically did not. Several members of each successor chapter then decided to take on the livery of the original Imperial Fists, effectively "reforming" the chapter before the decree was ended.

The moment the Changeling left, the device activated; it was the teleport homer from the Ravenwing Squadron and on the other side the entire contingent of Deathwing Terminators had been waiting for the signal. The battle was indeed ended.

<ul><li> Also, nothing prevents them from having the arms themselves - that is, huge stocks of weapons which, in an emergency, can be handed to <a class="urllink" href="http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/Frateris_Militia">untrained Ecclesiarchy members and huge mobs of faithful citizens<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li><li> <em>Yet another</em> dodge is that it is only the <em>Ecclesiarchy</em> that is to have no men under arms. Planetary Governors in the Imperium are allowed to raise armies, and many cardinals of the Ministorum are planetary governors as well, so while it is frowned upon by some, so long as the armies are raised in the role and legal persona of governor rather than cardinal it is not a violation of the Decree Passive.

</li><li> A servant character is tasked with guarding a rich man's house while he is away. When the rich man returns and asks if anyone has entered the house, the servant replies, "Not a fly!" The pleased master goes inside, only to discover dozens of people in the rooms. When he takes the servant to task for this, he responds that the master didn't find a <em>fly</em> in the house—he said nothing about people.

At the end of the musical, Sweeney discovers that the old Beggar Woman who has been harassing him throughout the show—and who he just murdered—<em>is</em> Lucy, driven insane by her rape, abandonment, and attempted suicide,</span> which leads to this exchange:

Grandpa Joe feels this is a cruel trick and he and Mr. Wonka almost come to blows over it, stopped only by Charlie Bucket, who understands that Wonka wasn't deliberately trying to trick them and regards it as a great present all the same (especially since he's never received presents from <em>anyone</em> outside of his family before).</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMusicMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMusicMan">The Music Man</a></em> combines this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnOneCondition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnOneCondition">On One Condition</a>. "Old Miser" Madison, a wealthy man, donates extensive property to River City after his death, including the Madison Public Library. But his will expressly states that he's left the city the library <em>building</em>—the books inside belong to Marian Paroo, the old man's only friend. It's implied that Madison did this because he realized that most of the people in town hate Marian; by making the library books her legal property, he guaranteed her a job for as long as she lives.

He is eager to leave the eponymous pirate band, and does so upon turning twenty-one. In the second act, the Pirate King and Ruth inform him that he was born on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeapDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeapDay">February 29th</a>, and that the apprenticeship was to end on his twenty-first <em>birthday</em>. Consequently, he isn't free to leave the pirate band until he's <em>eighty-four</em> years old. This makes things awkward for him when the Pirate King <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer">decides to hold to the exact letter of the contract</a>. In a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a>, Frederick points out that this is unfair, but as his whole character is defined by the concept of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a>, he begrudgingly rejoins them.

The goal, as given via a sheet of paper, is to find an exit, a door with a 9 on it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em><strong>A</strong></em> door. It never says there is only one, and in fact there are two, but everyone assumes there's only one door 9 because there's just one of every other numbered door, 1 to 8. When this is discovered, one character observes that there was no need for distrust and competition as two doors 9 are enough for everyone to escape. Of course, knowing that from the start might not have prevented various murders since the murderer was familiar with the game's layout anyway.</span>
<ul><li> Related to that, Zero also didn't specifically say that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the number 9 doors were at the very end of the game, as the party eventually discovers one more number 9 door blocking the final escape route that's actually a number <em>q</em> door (which, through the use of base-36 and digital roots as was used all throughout the rest of the game, makes it a number 8 door.)</span>
</li><li> Also, depending on if you mean the Japanese or English translation of the game, the set up for all this changes. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In Japanese, Zero makes his announcement over the loudpseaker and says to "seek a door that caries a <em>kyuu</em>", which the cast takes to mean the Japanese word for 9. However, he meant the above mentioned "q" door, the true exit to the ship. Meanwhile, to preserve the pun in English, the instructions are changed to written text given to each player, with the font choice making a lower-case q look like a kind of seven-segment-ish 9, (which can be confirmed by looking at the visual made to show the rules sheet in-game).</span>

This means its exact wording (including what is <em>not</em> told) is really important in figuring out what actually happened. For example, for the first twilight of the first game, it is said that "The identity of all unidentified corpses is guaranteed" and that "no body double was used". But no red truth says <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that there were six corpses in the garden shed. It turns out Shannon's corpse <em>wasn't actually there</em> from the beginning.</span> It's all because third-person narration is <em>not</em> neutral, and lies to the player in a number of scenes.

Some characters are very particular about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord">promises</a>, so a shrewd player pays close attention to exactly what is being promised before making a difficult choice.

It's amazing how a little freedom-or-death struggle brings out the manipulative sides of people.
<ul><li> Possibly the straightest example of this trope is in a possible bad ending, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">just before a certain Ally or Betray choice, Clover asks Sigma to choose "Betray", so she and Sigma can get more points and Clover in particular will reach 9 points. Clover promises Sigma that if Sigma chooses Betray, Clover will listen to <em>anything</em> Sigma says! But picking "Betray" at this point will get you the bad ending, because upon reaching 9 points Clover promptly goes for the exit. Sigma angrily shouts to Clover that she promised she would listen to anything Sigma said, and Clover replies that she <em>is</em> listening, she can hear Sigma very clearly even from all the way over there! The problem is that Clover only promised to <em>listen</em> to whatever Sigma says, not to actually <em>do</em> whatever Sigma says</span>.
</li><li> Another example is in Tenmyouji's ending. Tenmyouji and Quark <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">pick betray, and picking ally results in Sigma asking why they betrayed him. They don't answer, however Tenmyouji promises him that even though both him and Quark have 9 points, they won't open the number 9 door. A moment later, Clover, who had also reached 9 points in her own voting session, opens the number 9 door. Tenmyouji and Quark promptly move to go through it with her, much to Sigma's anger who reminds them of their promise. Tenmyouji then says to Sigma that he promised <em>they</em> wouldn't <em>open</em> the number 9 door. Which they didn't, Clover did. They didn't say anything about not escaping</span>.
</li><li> At any ending where someone escapes, the announcer comments that all doors other than the Number 9 Door have been unlocked. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This includes the door nigh-identical to the 9 Door that sits in the warehouse one floor down.</span>

However, due to Sasami's feelings for their friend Kengo, Riki and Rin fail to hook them up.

The fact that Aikawa can think about something besides Sasami and can focus on schoolwork again is enough to complete the mission.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/Tonin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/Tonin">Tonin</a></em>, a Brazilian web series featured in <em>Charges.com.br</em>, has many instances of this:
<ul><li> In <em>Tonin - O Ninja Que Veio da Roça</em>, , Vilano-san, the main villain, asked a spirit to make his body resistant to harm. The spirit said he'd only do it if Vilano defeated him in a card game. Vilano only agreed on the condition that each one would draw one's own cards. Instead of drawing cards from the spirit's deck, he drew cards from his pocket, getting himself a better hand. When the spirit protested, Vilano reminded him about the agreement about drawing one's <em>own</em> cards.
</li><li> In sequel series <em>Tonin - A Vorta dos Que Num Foi</em>, Tonin and his friends were stuck in the future and the spirit was their only chance to return. Being an oracle, the spirit said his only duty was of answering questions. The spirit also told that he's bound to this duty until Tonin dismisses him. Tonin then challenged the spirit to send them back to the past, promising he'd never ask any questions from that day onwards if the spirit succeeds. Once they went back in time, Tonin pointed out that, since they've gone back several years from the day he promised to stop making questions, he still has all that time back to make questions without going back on his word.
</li><li> Years later (from Tonin's perspective), he went back to the day he made that deal and asked the oracle how could there have two of him in two different places at the same time but, since they were in a period of time the oracle no longer had to answer questions as per the agreement, the oracle refused to answer. Tonin argued it was the other Tonin who made the deal but the oracle explained they were the same Tonin. Tonin then asked how this could be possible. By doing so, he unwittingly answered the question he initially refused to.
</li><li> In trequel series <em>Tonin - O Ninja dos Inferno</em>, Tonin sells his soul to the Devil in exchange for the power to defeat Vilano-san and Pai-Meio. The terms of the agreement stated that the Devil would be able to collect the soul once Vilano and Pai-Meio would no longer be able to pose a threat. The two villains were eventually killed. When the Devil tried to collect the soul, it was argued that Vilano and Pai-Meio being dead doesn't mean <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">they'd never be able to pose a threat again</a>. Considering the world where the story took place, the argument makes sense.
</li><li> In order to reach the Devil to strike the deal in the first place, Tonin had to, once again, outsmart the spirit. The spirit was unwilling to help Tonin in any way other than doing his job (answering questions). Tonin then asked if he'd make a good deal with the Devil. Since the only way to know was having Tonin meet the Devil, the spirit had no choice but to take Tonin to hell. Also, when Tonin proposed the deal to the Devil, Tonin offered his "<em>arma</em>". ("Arma" could be either the Brazilian word for "weapon" or the way Brazilian unsophisticated country people say "alma", the Brazilian word for "soul".) The spirit, who served as witness for the deal, said that either Tonin and the Devil reached for an agreement on which meaning the word "arma" would be employed for the deal, or the deal would be null and void. Unable to convince the Devil to taking anything from him as a "weapon", Tonin agreed to offer his soul.
</li><li> In <em>Tonin - A Saga Final</em>, a witch tried to avoid a witch hunter by magically disguising her appearance but he saw through her disguise and offered her a deal: if she taught him how to disguise himself, he'd leave her alive somewhere nobody would lay their hands at her. After she fulfilled her end of the bargain, he left her alive, but tied at a stake where nobody would lay anything other than fire.
</li><li> Also, hoping to have the same near-invulnerability his father won in the deal from the first season, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlordJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlordJr">Vilano Segundo (Vilano the Second)</a> sought the same oracle, who had him play a cheese eating contest against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a>. If <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlordJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlordJr">Overlord Jr.</a> wins, he'll gain said near invulnerability; if he loses, he loses his life. Being somewhat of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral">Chaotic Neutral</a> and considering the villain was alone while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> had lots of friends in the place where the contest was held, the oracle granted the villain temporary protection from harm until the contest was over. The oracle also ruled that the first contestant whose pile of cheese was eaten would be the winner; no cheese could be wasted; no cheese could be vomited; there was no time limit; and the villain would win by default if he had no opponents. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> shared his cheese with his friends because shared food isn't <em>wasted</em> food and there was no rule saying <em>who</em> had to eat his cheese. The villain then stabbed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> to death to invoke the win by lack of opponent rule because there was no rule saying he couldn't kill the opponent. Beause of the oracle's protection, nobody could kill the villain until the contest was over. Once the villain was declared the winner and the oracle declared the contest over, one of the good guys killed the villain before the oracle granted the powers. (The protection being over once the contest was over) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">Nobody mentioned it in the series but, since the powers came with vulnerability to cheese, the hero's friends could have hit the villain with the remaining cheese if the villain had been granted the powers</a>.

</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Vegeta</strong>: ...I won't <em>punch</em> you. <br/><strong>Krillin</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Oddly specific.</a>
</div><ul><li> This trope is also used to revive Nappa at the end of Season 2. Popo has Shenron revive everyone who was killed by Freeza and his men. Because Vegeta was still working for Freeza when he killed Nappa, that means Nappa gets to come <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>, much to Vegeta's annoyance.
</li><li> When a confused and frustrated Semi-Perfect Cell demands to know how Vegeta has gotten so much stronger, Vegeta smugly responds that "I trained all day yesterday." This really is what Vegeta did to get stronger, but he leaves out the fact that he did this training in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearInsideHourOutside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearInsideHourOutside">the Hyperbolic Time Chamber</a>.
</li><li> It's also used the other way once Cell has been killed; Yamcha wishes for everyone <strong>on Earth</strong> that was killed by Cell to be revived. That ends up excluding everyone that got killed when Cell blew up King Kai's planet, with the latter being quite upset about it.
<div class="indent"><strong>King Kai:</strong> Yeah, thanks for specifying "on Earth", by the way! <em>YAMCHA!</em> <em><strong>YOU ASSHOLE!</strong></em>

When Matt returns to point out the new problem, he requests that the photo focuses on the subject, so Chris focuses on the dogs having sex (mistakenly believing them to be the subject) and not Burnie. When he has that error called out and is told to focus on Burnie, he dresses Burnie up in a dog suit for the next photo, making him cry in the process, and points out he did exactly what he was told by making people's eyes go right to Burnie, albeit for the worst possible reasons. This last one is enough to get him fired by Matt, who is by this point exasperated.

Since then, he has Let's Played <em>Super Mario 64 <strong>DS</strong></em> and <em>Super <strong>Luigi</strong> Galaxy</em>. (And he fudged a bit on that first one too, by including parts of the original game whenever an original star was removed in the remake.)

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/PewDiePie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/PewDiePie">PewDiePie</a> caused an uproar when, as his channel was nearing the 50 million subscriber milestone, he released a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-_4Uoo_7Y4">video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> announcing to his viewers that he "would delete his Youtube channel once pewdiepie hits 50 million", grabbing widespread media attention.

This stunt especially earned the ire of all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">trolls</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom">detractors</a> who had subscribed to him at this point just to force him to quit.

</li><li> On his <em>Bad Gods</em> website, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LoreSjoberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LoreSjoberg">Lore Sjöberg</a> had skits about a radio station that plays nothing but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM">R.E.M.</a>'s <em>Stand</em>. One of them had the DJ excitedly announce that The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PussycatDolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PussycatDolls">Pussycat Dolls</a> had just released a cover of the song, and they had a copy, but since they play <em>nothing but</em> REM's <em>Stand</em>, he played that instead.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTimTebowCFLChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTimTebowCFLChronicles">The Tim Tebow CFL Chronicles</a></em>, this comes up when interpreting the rules of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Calvinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Calvinball">Canadian football</a>:
<ul><li> You can't ground the ball to end the play if you aren't <em>on the ground</em>. Which means there's no way to end a play (and conversely, nothing to stop opponents from trying to "force a fumble") if the carrier is in the third story of a house, or in water, or on a ship.
</li><li> In Greenland, Tebow uses a catapult to "throw" the ball over the horizon, based on a vague promise that there's an Argonaut over there to catch it.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Schooner:</strong> Are you allowed to throw it if there isn't an intended receiver? <br/><strong>Tebow:</strong> Sure there is. I intend for there to be a receiver.
</div></li><li> A long-standing gag of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd">The Angry Video Game Nerd</a></em> is that the video game of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DrJekyllAndMrHyde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DrJekyllAndMrHyde">Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</a></em> is the worst video game ever made, yet he's long-since played much worse ones like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BigRigsOverTheRoadRacing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BigRigsOverTheRoadRacing">Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PlumbersDontWearTies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PlumbersDontWearTies">Plumbers Don't Wear Ties</a></em>. He's since justified this with the Shit Scale, which categorizes the badness of video games. Jekyll and Hyde makes up the second-worse category all by itself while everything that's worse falls into the "so bad it doesn't even count as a game" category; as anything worse than Jekyll and Hyde no longer counts as a game, it makes Jekyll and Hyde the worst video <em>game</em> ever made.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Nerd:</strong> When ranking terrible games, there's usually a certain level of playability. Even though I maintain Jekyll and Hyde is the worst game I've ever played, there's still that unholy category that lies underneath; games that can't even be called games.
</div></li><li> This is an April Fool's Day tradition on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a></em> - the "Did you know?" section of the front page on April 1st contains a bunch of misleading but true facts, with the misleading nature of the assertions revealed if you click on the relevant link. One year, for example, it claimed that "The Australian government requires high-risk sex workers to wear full-face respirators"; clicking on the word "sex" revealed that they were actually referring to the chemical sodium ethyl xanthate, which is indeed a respiratory hazard.
