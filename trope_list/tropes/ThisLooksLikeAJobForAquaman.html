<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, Winry Rockwell's only real skill is working on automail, so she's only ever useful when Edward needs his automail limbs repaired, upgraded, or replaced. Fortunately for her, this happens numerous times throughout the series, ensuring she at least occasionally has a productive role in the story.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KonoSuba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KonoSuba">KonoSuba</a></em>, Aqua is overjoyed when she finds a quest on the guild job board that perfectly matches her skill set: Purifying a corrupted lake.

This allowed her to fight Snivy and let Ash catch her. Funnily enough, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfGameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfGameplayAndStoryIntegration">a regular Trainer probably would've used Pidove anyway</a> due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">Elemental RockPaperScissors</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew">Tokyo Mew Mew</a></em>, while Mew Lettuce's powers are less useful than those of the other Mews, she is useful on a few occasions. In one filler episode, she, being a bookworm, can resist falling asleep as a Chimera Anima made from a book reads aloud, and can counterattack. In another, when the Mews get bound in silk by a spider-like Chimera Anima, she can still use her castanets, which only require her fingers, and defeats the monster.
</li><li> Season 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack">Darker Than Black</a></em> has the character April, who in the first season used her ability (essentially to make it rain) primarily as support for her partner who can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson">freeze things</a>, gets a freak chance to use her ability offensively. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She happens to fight a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> and none of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers">Required Secondary Powers</a>, which made each raindrop impact with the force of a bullet.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SDGundamForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SDGundamForce">SD Gundam Force</a></em>, the Gundivers were only good for underwater missions, and as such were only useful whenever something important fell into the sea. By the final battle of the series they were upgraded with flight capabilities, becoming the Gunchoppers.
</li><li> Submarimon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em> can only used in water because he's... a submarine. However, he has flight abilities, but they were utilized only one time outside of water, during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em>, Crow's Black-Winged Dragon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CCGImportanceDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CCGImportanceDissonance">(though hyped up a fair bit)</a> is considered to be by far the weakest Signer Dragon by players in the actual game, because its only effect is being able to stop Burn damage - a strategy that is niche at best in real life, and it's not even especially good at it. However, nearly every time it appeared in the anime, the opponent played a deck that utilized Burn in some capacity, and the arc after he got it featured the card Speed World 2 (which had a Burn effect) in almost every Duel. Amusingly, cards with self-burn effects would have some synergy with this effect, but Crow doesn't use them!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> In Thriller Bark, Perona ate the Hollow-Hollow Fruit, which allows her to generate ghosts that cause whoever touches them to become extremely negative and emotionally hollow. This power has been shown to bring down even the 'Monster Trio' of the Straw Hats, Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji. Usopp, on the other hand, is so pessimistic that the ghosts have no effect on him, and in fact contact causes <em>Perona</em> to become negative!
</li><li> In the Dressrosa Arc, the situation of the Funk Brothers is pretty much tailor-made to make Kelly Funk's Jacket Jacket Fruit powers actually useful. Kelly can transform himself into full-body jacket that, when worn, allows him to take over the wearer's body, though that method makes it unlikely for him to take over someone who wasn't already willing. Bobby Funk is inexplicably strong and durable but has no fighting ability, and Kelly Funk is extremely aggressive but also relatively weak, with that combination allowing Kelly's ability to take over his brother's body to make them more formidable that way rather than simply fighting separately.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>:

Iggy's Stand, The Fool, allows him to control sand. Normally, this would be a very situational power since it's useless when there's no sand around, but given how the protagonists' destination is in Egypt, he's much more powerful in the desert environment.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureVentoAureo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureVentoAureo">Part 5</a> has Squalos Stand, The Clash, a shark that can teleport from one body of liquid to anothe, sizeshifting to match. This would limit his effectiveness if he didnt fight Buccerattis crew in Venice, where there are plenty of large bodies of water to unleash his full potential.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStoneOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStoneOcean">Part 6</a> has Survivor, which was said to be the weakest, least useful stand in existence by Dio and Pucci. Its power is to cause a weak electric impulse which stimulates the parts of the brain responsible for aggression, and allowing those affected to see their opponents' weak points, turning those affected into expert, relentless fighters who attack anyone they see. The reason why it's so useless is because it affects everyone in range indiscriminately, meaning that the user's enemies become expert fighters, while his allies turn against him. The only situation where it could be useful is if you have someone you really want dead, and they're trapped somewhere with other strong fighters who could probably kill your target if a big fight started. Like say, a maximum-security prison full of dangerous criminals...

Saitama has played the game and could beat a few of his adversaries but is ultimately overcome. Most of the others have never touched a video game in their lives and, despite their colossal powers, are quickly defeated. Up steps King, who proceeds to demolish all of Hellish Blizzard's other goons - including the pro - all by himself and without breaking a sweat. This comes up again in an OVA, when King demolishes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller">Garou</a> in a VR fighting game simulation, solidifying his legendary status as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">World's Strongest Man</a>.

This proves to be an essential power when Meruem, the Chimera Ant King, takes over her country and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartPeoplePlayChess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartPeoplePlayChess">challenges the best board gamers in the country to face him</a>. He quickly beats the others, but the fact that he cannot beat Komugi, no matter how hard he tries or how many games he plays, causes him to focus exclusively on playing gungi with Komugi. This results in Meruem being distracted for days, possibly weeks, and allows the heroes to stand a fighting chance against Meruem and his overwhelming power and intellect.

Later, when the students are seeking internships, Froppy went to work with the coast guard to make the best of her aquatic abilities. The other coast guard heroes also have water-related quirks, indicating that the Aquamen of this world go out and find jobs that suit their aquatic abilities.

He asked the audience what superpower a hypothetical Milky Bar kid superhero might possess, to which they provided a series of bizarre answers such as "super-taste", "the ability to turn people into chocolate", etc. O'Briain promptly mused that, if the hypothetical superhero possessed such a superpower, each episode of the hypothetical TV series would consist of this (and then provided an example of how absurd a crime for which "super-taste" would be necessary to solve it would be).

</li><li> His telepathy is also shown to have some limited degree of usefulness with non-marine species, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>. Some writers go to extremes by combining "can summon and control sea creatures" with "every living thing on Earth has evolved from sea life" to giving him power over more or less everything. Usually this was presented as near-total control over sea life and the ability to stun or confuse humans or other animals; Aquaman was able to induce a seizure in the Martian speedster Züm in an early issue of Morrison's JLA by attacking the parts of his Martian brain that had evolved from sea creatures.
</li><li> In another issue of JLA, as part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a> storyline kickoff, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Mageddon</a> initiated a riot at a super villain lockdown and the Justice League were sent in to contain it since the warden and all guards had gone cuckoo as well. While the rest of the team was handling things elsewhere in the building, Aquaman all by his lonesome busted into a room filled with about fifty bad guys with light-based abilities. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreAssKickingOneLiner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreAssKickingOneLiner">He just stared them down and said,</a> "Most of your powers are dependent on light.

Earlier in the series, Aquaman is being beaten up by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk">She-Hulk</a>... then realizes he doesn't need to beat her and succeeds in gaining one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffins</a> which is underwater. Later that issue he scatters a group of the strongest Avengers who are beating up Superman (including She-Hulk) by summoning a giant sea-monster while in the Savage Land.
</li><li> Perhaps Aquaman's most impressive showing is in the <em>Earth 2</em> graphic novel. When evil counterparts of the Justice League from a parallel universe invade Washington DC, Aquaman shows up to stop them — with the entire Atlantean navy backing him up.
</li><li> This led to a popular image macro with Aquaman handling a massive alien invasion that decided (fatally) to invade over water, <a class="urllink" href="https://thisispopcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/aquaman2.jpg">summoning an incredible number of super-sized sharks to launch into the air to chomp them out of existence, as Batman and Green Lantern look on in amazement<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>. "I'm useless, they said. I have stupid powers, they said..." The panel comes from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a></em> incarnation of Aquaman where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns">Geoff Johns</a> has been working once again to dispel the notion of Aquaman's uselessness.

</li><li> On the other hand, the original Aqualad knew his limits at times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheNewTeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheNewTeenTitans">The New Teen Titans</a></em>. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Robin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Robin">Robin</a> wanted him to join the team on an intergalactic mission, Aqualad declined, saying that his abilities were of little use in outer space.
</li><li> However, in the original <em>Teen Titans</em> books, this was played straight. Bob Haney clearly had a hard time figuring out how to make Aqualad seem useful, so he'd often throw in contrived water-based set pieces to give him something to do (such as a swimming pool in issue #4, a high dive tank in #6, and sewers in #8). He was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> and replaced by Speedy in issue #19, and after eventually rejoining the team, he ended up resigning in issue #51 precisely because he'd developed an inferiority complex over his perceived uselessness.

It's explained that the whole point of putting a civilian in charge is that the Stargate program shouldn't be a military operation, and since a large part of it involves meeting and trading with other civilisations a diplomat is the perfect person for the job. If anything her appointment inverted this trope, since everyone involved previously lacked this obviously necessary expertise and frequently got in trouble as a result.

Notable examples include:
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Heatmor_(Dark_Explorers_19)">Heatmor (Dark Explorers)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who has one attack, Hot Lick, that does a measly 10 damage but does 60 damage if the target is Durant—and was released at a time the <a class="urllink" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Durant_Mill_(TCG)">Durant Mill<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> deck was making short work of most other decks. In particular, Hot Lick needs only 1 Energy of any type to use allowing Heatmor to fit into any deck, including other Durant Mill decks.
</li><li> Not long afterward, the major force in the tournament scene were Pokémon SP, Basic Pokémon with decent strength that were augmented by a pretty large amount of supplementary cards. The result was decks centered around Pokémon SP having blinding setup speed and maneuverability, able to shift and adapt to anything any non-SP Pokémon can throw at it. Anything except for <a class="urllink" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Machamp_(Stormfront_20)">Machamp (Stormfront)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who has an attack that will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">immediately KO</a> any Basic Pokémon it targets. Machamp decks aren't designed to do much except end Pokémon SP decks, but there were so many Pokémon SP decks at the time that Machamp decks became an equally common scene in tournaments.

The Japanese unique unit, however - the Samurai - faces tough competition from Japan's other top-tier infantry (generic) unit, the champion. Samurai are only slightly more powerful than champions in their general stats, and they cost more gold to produce, which is a finite resource and makes samurai less cost-effective. However, if you're fighting civilizations which heavily rely on their own unique units, samurai gain an attack bonus against them, which turns them into terrifying killing machines capable of defeating all but the toughest unique units one-on-one.

However, it suddenly gains massive utility when fighting the Whip's Memory, which is <em>weak</em> to Dark damage, meaning you can easily defeat <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a simulated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaRondoOfBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaRondoOfBlood">Richter Belmont</a></span> just by tossing pies at it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiscoElysium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiscoElysium">Disco Elysium</a></em>, one of the skills unlocked with the Thought Cabinet gives the Detective a +2 to hit targets wearing T-500 armor.

</li><li> EMP weaponry in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EventHorizon">Event Horizon</a></em> disables any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields">Energy Shield</a> the enemy has. This is of little relevance in normal gameplay since most of enemies aren't shielded at all, but starbases of several factions rely on powerful shielding as their only form of defense and become laughably easy to destroy after it is disabled.

For an almost literal example, the Aqua Boy/Girl perk makes you immune to radiation from swimming and wading in water sources - the many irradiated rivers which criss-cross post-apocalyptic Boston suddenly turn from difficult barriers to inviting avenues of approach, and you can also easily fish goodies out of flooded basements.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder">Fate/Grand Order</a></em>, a number of characters are pretty useless for either wiping out mobs in farming missions or defeating difficult enemies in story missions, but are incredibly strong at handling "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel">challenge quests</a>" or certain boss battles.
<ul><li> Angra Mainyu is generally considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a>. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a> is Verg Avesta, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector">Attack Reflector</a> that allows him to take the damage he takes in a turn and send it back at double strength (increasing when upgraded). Ordinarily, a mix of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealthDamageAsymmetry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealthDamageAsymmetry">Health/Damage Asymmetry</a>, his poor survivability, and the likelihood of the enemy not targeting him makes this ability pretty useless. However, in one challenge quest, the enemies are giant hermit crabs with an irremovable buff that grants them pretty hefty damage reduction, such that even teams built to do massive damage struggle with taking them down. Since Verg Avesta <em>always</em> does double the damage Angra took, this means it bypasses the crab's defenses and lets him finish them off in only a few turns.
</li><li> Euryale is a fairly common and cheap Archer, with a kit designed to disable male enemies with Charm while she charges up her Noble Phantasm, then fire it off with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SituationalSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SituationalSword">extra anti-Male damage</a> and another Charm stuck on top to buy her the time to do it again. While she's helpful in her niche, she tends to suffer from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">Crippling Overspecialization</a>, as her damage output and utility against anything that isn't male tends to be kind of bad, and other single-target Archers can put in similar work. However, there's a very specific boss battle regarded as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>: namely, the fight with Gawain in Camelot. Gawain is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">dripping with durability buffs, has high health to begin with</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpamAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpamAttack">charges up his hard-hitting Noble Phantasm very quickly</a>. Against most teams, he shrugs off all damage and fires off a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HerdHittingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HerdHittingAttack">Herd-Hitting Attack</a> every two turns that will probably kill the entire lineup. Gawain is also male. Also, he has class disadvantage against Euryale, so she does double damage and takes half. Also, Euryale has a skill that drains enemy NP charge. Also, if Gawain is stunned by Charm, he can't charge. With her whole kit in play and some team support, Euryale can make an absolute mockery of Gawain, trapping him in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfHurting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfHurting">Cycle of Hurting</a> with Charm as she fires off shots that take off a quarter of his health bar each and never lets him get his big attack off. It's not uncommon for players to raise up Euryale <em>just to kill Gawain.</em>
</li><li> Mata Hari, generally regarded as one of the game's worst characters for her miserable stats, short-duration debuffs, and laughable damage, saw some use being pressed into service against the final boss of Part 1, Goetia. This is because one of her abilities is to seal skills, and Goetia always starts off his fight with a gigantic personal buff (which counts as a skill). On top of that, being an Assassin means that she can actually do some damage to him in the meantime.
</li><li> Ryougi Shiki is generally considered rather good, but one part of her kit that doesn't get much respect is her Instant Death abilities, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity">never work on enemies you'd actually want to kill.</a> However, in the event where she was first available, every enemy had a significantly reduced resistance to instant death effects, meaning Shiki usually had about an 80% chance of killing whatever she could hit with her Noble Phantasm. This is particularly evident in one sidequest where her Void Shiki counterpart is available as a support Servant: it consists of three enemies that all have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOfTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOfTheBeast">6,666,666</a> HP, in a game where the hardest bosses tend to have HP in the 1-2 million range. Void Shiki is pretty much the only thing that can kill them in a somewhat timely fashion, and she's very likely to wipe them out in one turn.

Coincidentally, the Giant Demon Boar challenge quest in Chaldea Summer Memory's rerun fits all these criteria, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">even makes sense in-lore</a> (Arthur has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">experience with these things</a>).
</li><li> Notably, this was infamously attempted in the Orleans singularity, which is full of strong dragon enemies, and towards the end, has you obtain Siegfried (a character with hefty damage boosts when fighting dragons) as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">Guest-Star Party Member</a>. As it turned out, though, Siegfried was not well-designed to kill dragons at launch, owing to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a> statline and lack of class advantage over the Rider-class dragons, meaning this instead became a Job for Sasaki Kojirou, who, despite being a one-star, was the cheapest character to boast class advantage over Riders and the only one to have an evasion skill at base level. This resulted in Kojirou becoming something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">Memetic Badass</a>. Later on, Siegfried was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">Rescued from the Scrappy Heap</a> by significant buffs to his damage that made him more able to kill dragons even without class advantage, and there have been a few events that actually <em>do</em> seem tailor-made to take advantage of his skillset (such as one Valentines event node which was nothing but Lancer-class dragons).
</li><li> The infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Nerofest First Hassan Exhibition Battle</a>, particularly in its bugged American incarnation, is often seen as the hardest challenge the game ever produced, due to being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss">Marathon Boss</a> with lots of damage and tons of instant-death attacks that bypassed defense and evasion. This resulted in Irisviel, at the time the only character capable of giving the whole party Guts (a skill that lets an ally survive an attack that would kill them with reduced health) on a regular basis, and who also boasted class advantage over Hassan, abruptly becoming very desirable as the only way to make sure your team survived when Hassan was almost guaranteed to kill at least one every two turns.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage">White Mage</a> class in general when used for offensive purposes. For most of the game they are pure support characters whose contribution to the party's offensive might is functionally non-existent. However, bringing a White Mage to a dungeon with a large amount of undead turns their healing magic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReviveKillsZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReviveKillsZombie">into a powerful offensive weapon</a>.

It's normally the definition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>, since the damage formula is not a forgiving one, and it takes hours to grind up the five or six spells you probably use enough for it to dish out damage on par with your standard attacks. But in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a> of the remake, you have Minwu, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter">Crutch Character</a> who starts with dozens of spells already at low-mid levels — meaning he is perfectly suited to abuse Ultima's damage formula and becomes the party's heavy hitter.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">3D remake</a> downplays this by buffing the Scholar to be more generally usable: "Scan" and "Peep" are combined into "Enemy Scan" (which throws in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DispelMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DispelMagic">Erase</a> for good measure), the Scholar is given access to low-level magic, which their stat growths can finally use, and most importantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemAmplifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemAmplifier">an item used by the scholar during battle will be twice as effective</a>.

As a bard, his weapon is a harp with weak normal attacks. His two talents are songs and hiding. He songs often fail to work on regular enemies, and most bosses are immune to them. His hiding serves no purpose other then self-preservation. However, there is one moment where his musical talent saves the entire team, although ironically that happens when he's no longer a member of the main party. He uses his harp to disable the magnetic field in the dark elf's cave, which had been preventing the party from using most of the their weapons, saving the team from certain defeat.

As a result some bosses were deliberately designed to be near impossible to beat WITHOUT using Runic. In fact, the first boss you fight right after recruiting Celes fits this—it casts a lot of magic and the Celes recognizes this and tells the player to use Runic in anticipation of its spells. For many players, this is the <em>only</em> time they ever use the ability, since Runic will <em>also</em> absorb any friendly spells <em>you</em> cast, like Cure.

There's equipment that can nullify or absorb shadow damage, but they quickly get outclassed by better gear later on and there's no random encounter or boss encounter where shadow damage even happens.

<ul><li> The most obvious offender in <em>Dark Dawn</em> is in the lead-up to the final dungeon.

The boss weaknesses are also rebalanced, so that one weapon is effective against the boss, another is weak, and the rest do average damage (for example, Super Arm deals six units of damage to Cut Man, but Hyper Bomb only deals one unit, and the other special weapons only deal three).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZX">Mega Man ZX</a></em>:
<ul><li> Vent/Aile's human form in the first game is completely useless outside of two situations: When they need to talk to civilians (since they're too freaked out by the Biometal forms and just tell them to go away,) and when they need to climb through holes (since none of the Biometal forms can crouch.) Rescuing civilians from a burning building is an objective in Area G (civilians who are conveniently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a> and <em>still</em> refuse to cooperate unless they return to your unpowered form,) and there are plenty of crawlspaces connecting certain areas and acting as one-way passageways. Model LX is also the least practical form outside of its Item Scanner ability (it has a powerful melee weapon, but no ranged options that don't consume Weapon Energy and it can't attack while moving), but gains god-like maneuverability in water, which comes in handy in Area J, a place almost completely underwater and loaded with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpikesOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpikesOfDoom">Spikes of Doom</a>, and conveniently can only be accessed after gaining Model LX.
</li><li> In <em>Advent</em>, Chronoforce is essentially a more armored Model L (which you get again) who's even <em>more</em> crippled outside of water (Model L can at least fight and move on land, Chronoforce <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater">is dead weight unable to move</a>). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">However</a></em>, Chronoforce's armored shell can still protect from attacks coming down from above, making it a useful impromptu shield, and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill">Time Bomb</a> can still be used. Most importantly, it's completely possible to use Time Bomb, then switch to another form to take advantage of the slowed time.
</li></ul></li><li> The whole universe of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em> is like this. Why, when their sworn enemy's most unique ability involves rolling up into a little ball, the Space Pirates persist in building their bases and ships with little passageways that can only be navigated by a ball-shaped object of exactly that size, no one knows.

The first dungeon after she joins you is a volcano where most of the enemies (including the boss) are weak to water, making her very useful here. But once that's done, fire-based enemies are relatively uncommon, so even though she does learn some powerful moves like Tidal Wave, there's not much reason to use her when other partners can do the same thing and tend to have better utility on top of that.
</li><li> To a lesser extent there's Kooper. He's useful when he first joins since he can attack multiple enemies without an upgrade, but his inability to do <em>anything</em> against aerial enemies makes him less desirable once you get more partners, and neither his Super or Ultra Rank moves are particularly useful...until you get to the Shiver Region, where most of the enemies are weak to fire, so the otherwise forgettable Fire Shell suddenly becomes <em>very</em> useful.
</li></ul></li><li> Junpei in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> is usually considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy">Tier-Induced Scrappy</a> due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">Master of None</a> tendencies. There is, however, one later boss that he is actually useful for as it is immune to everything except physical attacks. Of course, Akihiko, Ken, and Aigis is still a better combination; but it brings him from totally useless to at least somewhat useful.

However, you won't be able to get all the ship parts/treasures without them, because they're the only Pikmin that can survive in water. Keep in mind that there are quite a bit of watery areas, especially in the Distant Spring/Perplexing Pool where the majority of the area is in water.

However, due to events you'll do before the fight, you'll end up with a Pokémon who directly counters <em>their</em> part, turning the odds in your favour. The Pokémon themselves are pretty mediocre statistically and will probably only serve you for this one battle and not much else.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2">Pokémon Black 2 and White 2</a></em>, Elesa still retains her difficulty level if your own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon">Mons</a> are underlevelled... unless you use a Sandslash with Rock Tomb and Dig. Sandslash's ground typing locks Elesa's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon">Mons</a> out of Volt Switch, and allows Sandslash to keep on attacking.
</li><li> In competitive battles, several Pokemon are only useful for one situation or to counter one thing. Quagsire is only used to counter enemy stat boosts for stall teams, while Aerodactyl is used to quickly get Stealth Rock on the field for of heavy offensive teams. Half the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Uber meta game</a> revolves around countering Kyogre.

However, it has the coveted Magnet Pull ability to trap Steel-types, so it becomes exceptionally good at beating Skarmory, one of the premier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Walls</a>.
<ul><li> Before evolving in Gen 4, Magneton was this for Gen 3. Magneton's stats and typing were not ideal for the metagame before or during Gen 3, but with Magnet Pull it was the ultimate Skarmory counter, since it could keep it trapped, shrug off anything in Skarmory's arsenal bar the rare Hidden Power Ground, and then blow it up with Thunderbolt. That was the main use for it, and one of the few it did well, but Skarmory was so big in the generation that such a role was worth using. As mentioned though, the evolution to Magnezone upgraded it to a more general usefulness.
</li></ul></li><li> Poison and Steel Mons have always been rather lame; both are notorious for having the worst offensive Mons in the series <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1mdd6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1mdd6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1mdd6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Previously, Poison was only super-effective against Grass, and Steel was only super-effective against Ice and Rock. All three of those types have enough weaknesses that Poison or Steel attacks are almost never needed to hit them hard. In the metagame, the only times they're used are to take advantage of STAB bonuses, make use of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionInitiative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionInitiative">priority move Bullet Punch</a>, or when there are no other options.</span>, but they fill this role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pokémon X and Y</a></em> where Fairy-Types are the new powerhouses, and players will need to be packing Mons with good Steel and Poison attacks to deal super-effective damage to the Fairy-type Pokémon, who can hit <em>hard</em>. This is even more pronounced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a></em>, which introduced the Island Guardians, a quartet of Fairy-types who generate field effects in their favor when deployed. If you don't have a super-effective move ready, they will annihilate your Pokémon.
<ul><li> The move Steel Roller was introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a></em>'s Isle of Armor DLC expansion. It's a very powerful Steel-type move that can only be used when said Island Guardians' field effects are in play and also ends those field effects.

</li></ul></li><li> Grass is also similarly a weak offensive type, with a whopping 7 types resisting it and the things it does hit super-effectively overlapping with more generally useful Electric and Water attacks. However, Game Freak introduced powerful Water / Ground type Pokémon such as Swampert whose sole weakness is Grass (and being a 4x weakness, nearly guaranteed to take them out in one blow), ensuring Grass attacks have a role as an anti-meta call against such threats. Starting in Generation VI, Grass-types are also immune to all moves involving powder and spores, moves that normally inflict nasty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">Standard Status Effects</a> and can otherwise cripple an entire team. In particular is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomMan">Amoonguss</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a> made even tougher to defeat by access to an otherwise guaranteed Sleep-inducing move...who, thanks to that immunity, crumbles in the face of any Grass Pokémon that can withstand Poison-type moves.

While Cinderace is more usable than the others, it can change its type to adapt to anything Rillaboom can throw at it while never losing STAB, and its wide arsenal of moves means it has plenty of anti-Grass options outside of Pyro Ball. Inteleon is slightly faster than Cinderace and its type shoots through the few holes in its movelist, allowing it to keep the rabbit under control on even terms. And Rillaboom's Grassy Surge allows it to outpace Inteleon with Grassy Glide, its monster HP can help it soak up the one Snipe Shot the lizard will get off, and Rillaboom's monster Attack versus Inteleon's weak Defense means that engagement can only end one way.

The worst example of this is the Diamondback—it's a unit that can attack on the move and does bonus damage to armored targets, and just so happens to be introduced in a mission where you need to chase down fast-moving armored trains. After this mission you'll never build them again because they're rather expensive and simply aren't very useful in comparison to more versatile, cheaper units like the Goliath and siege tank.
<ul><li> Though the game justifies it fairly well by explaining that your ship's engineer can only prepare new hardware so fast and he makes a point of working on stuff that is specifically going to be useful for the next mission.
</li><li> In Multiplayer, there exists a 'Hard Counter' mentality, where the standard response to "Unit X is Overpowered!" is "Make more of Unit Y." While there are indeed quite a few units <em>designed</em> with such purposes in mind, higher level play has shown that with sufficient skill anything can hard-counter anything else barring targeting limitations (air-only or ground-only).

The only gimmick Yoshi has going for him otherwise is that, once you've freed a Mario brother, you can automatically select their hat when starting a level, but the human characters can't turn into Yoshi, so Yoshi's the only character of the four who can access all four movesets and power-up sets in every level (apart from Bowser in the Sky and some of the secret bonus areas in Peach's Castle.

<ul><li> Ganondorf has a special move called the Warlock Punch, which in each game is one of the most powerful attacks any character has access to, and the flatout most powerful of any attack that doesn't have variable power. The catch? It has massive start-up lag with limited reach, so it's nigh-impossible to land on an opponent that isn't incapacitated. It additionally has massive ending lag, ensuring Ganondorf will eat a heavy punish if he doesn't actually land it. This combination of nigh-impossibility to land while having very high risk to use makes it considered one of the more impractical moves. However, in the Home-Run Content minigame, Warlock Punch becomes the absolute best move any character could ask for. See, the Warlock Punch is so powerful, it's more powerful than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO">Home-Run Bat</a> at high damages, as well as stronger than any other move. And since it's a move that executes with just a single press of a button, Ganondorf can wait until the last millisecond to use it, allowing him to rack up as much damage as possible in the time limit before using his finisher. Ganondorf himself can also rack up among the highest damage on the Sandbag within the time limit, so when combined with the Warlock Punch, he is the Home-Run King in every iteration of the Home-Run Contest, being able to send the Sandbag ludicrous distances exceeding 10,000 feet, far beyond what any other character is capable of.
</li><li> Palutena from the <em>Wii U</em> and <em>3DS</em> games has a custom move called Heavenly Light, where Palutena casts a giant beam of light from the sky around her. The light causes damage to anything under it, but it does only a little damage at a time and opponents don't even flinch to it. However, much like the Warlock Punch, while the move is garbage in actual fights, it is amazing in a mini-game; this time it's Trophy Rush. The range and damage are enough to break dozens of boxes at once as they rain down from the sky, racking up a huge combo meter easily.

(The hostel is buried in old, unfolded roadmaps! This looks like a job for Princess Glovebox!) There is precisely <em>one</em> power which never sees <em>any</em> use: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantDropTheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantDropTheHero">undroppable</a> Crimson Tape's ability to Create Organizational Charts (though it <em>might</em> explain why he is the designated leader of the League...).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Demoman can change up his whole focus by swapping out his grenade launcher and sticky bombs for boots and a shield and equipping a sword or axe in the melee slot. This turns him into a "Demoknight," with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">a blindingly fast charge, free crits, and a lot of damage resistance</a> - but no ranged capability whatsoever, including the loss of all his bombs. Demoknights tend to be fairly hit-or-miss as a result... except on Medieval Mode, where the majority of ranged weapons are deactivated. On that mode, the Demoknight effectively gives up none of his prowess and everyone bar Snipers and Medics have to fight on his turf, and consequently, he becomes the most powerful character in the game.
</li><li> In that same game mode, the Sniper's Huntsman bow and the Medic's Crusader's Crossbow go from being somewhat-viable alternatives to ungodly powerful. This is because they're the only primary ranged weapons to be unaffected by Medieval Mode, and <em>any</em> ranged weapon becomes a lot more effective when everyone else is in melee. By that same token, you'll also see a lot more Snipers using back-shields and Medics using the Amputator - the Sniper, because it's basically something for nothing, the Medic, because the Amputator's group-heal taunt becomes one of the few effective healing sources.
</li><li> The Cleaner's Carbine is usually seen as one of the worst Sniper weapons out there; it takes an already ineffective weapon (the SMG) and then makes it worse at shooting people, in exchange for an ability that requires you to shoot lots of people, and said ability (eight seconds of minicrits for you) is directly outclassed by Jarate's ability to make people in an area take minicrits from everyone for ten seconds. But in Mann vs. Machine, one of the primary enemies is the Tank, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">Damage-Sponge Boss</a> with ridiculous health, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity">Contractual Boss Immunity</a>, and no offense; the challenge being to simply do lots of damage very fast. Jarate is useless, and so are your usual headshots, but the Carbine can effortlessly build up the damage needed to charge its ability. Add in the Bushwhacka, a knife that turns mini-crits into normal crits, and suddenly, unloading the Cleaner's Carbine into a tank and then charging in with melee out can do thousands of points of damage without using any upgrades or canteens.
</li><li> The Hitman's Heatmaker, another Sniper weapon, has the downside of taking a penalty to bodyshot damage, and the upside that, after getting kills, you can activate Focus, which lets you stay scoped while reloading and increases your charge rate by 25%. In standard gameplay, this is seen as none too great; the inability to drop certain classes with a fully-charged bodyshot is irritating, and most of the time, you don't want to <em>stay</em> scoped after making a shot because it kills your field of vision and the target is probably dead already. But in MVM, there are Giant Robots that have so much health that they can survive multiple headshots, and the Explosive Headshots upgrade deals substantial damage to all bots in a short radius when the Sniper hits a headshot. A Sniper with the Heatmaker and good aim can keep shooting a Giant Robot without pause, dishing out massive damage while killing every bot in the area and staying Focused forever.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TerraBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TerraBattle">Terra Battle</a></em>, thanks to status ailments being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">Useless Useful Spell</a>, Remedy characters (which specializes in curing and causing ailments) are situationally useful at best, used more for their secondary buffs/heals rather than their ailments. However, there's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Lamia</a> battle, where most enemies (including the boss) takes next to no damage from both physical or magical attacks, and can only be killed with Poison. And the enemies has ailment spells with 100% success rate, so the Remedy characters' ailment curing and immunities are going to be vital.

Almost every obstacle in the episode (a maze of long narrow corridors, toxic gas that remains low to the ground, and the villain holding the Artifact Of The Week from a high altitude) seemed tailor-made for a person whose neck extends.
</li><li> The show also had a subversion during a later episode, by giving the villain Stinkor - a humanoid skunklike character with the power to, well...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">stink</a> - an upgrade that turns his rotten B.O. into directed jets of corrosive gas. As such, what was a laughably weak villain that the original series' creators swore they would <em>never</em> introduce to the series became such a big threat to He-Man and gang, that - during his debut episode - Skeletor not only recruited him as a minion, but also excluded from his usual punishment to failed minions. It helped that his abilities were clearly more geared for support rather than straight up attacking like the rest of Skeletor's forces. He would use his gas to disable the heroes by making them too sick to properly fight, giving the other minions a window of opportunity to take them out. If the rest of Skeletor's minions STILL couldn't take down the heroes after Stinkor's efforts to disable them, then it was hardly his fault if they failed.

</li><li> Padparadscha is a defective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seers">Sapphire</a> that can only see into the recent past. This is usually a crippling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerDisability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerDisability">Superpower Disability</a> (she has a hard time seeing the <em>present,</em> and <em>thinks</em> she's seeing the future when seeing the past. This means you're often having to drag her out of the line of danger she hasn't noticed yet or wait for her to catch up with what's going on.) but it comes in handy a few times. She used it to figure out that Emerald specifically meant to miss her shots at the ship, and at another time to catch that the captain was pressing the wrong button.
</li></ul></li><li> Aquaman on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperFriends">Super Friends</a></em> show.
<ul><li> Happens in every single episode of the original 1973/74 season, usually in the form of a villain-caused problem occurring on, under or near a body of water. In addition there were several water-based opponents on the show, such as the episodes "Dr. Pelagian's War", "The Weather Maker" and "The Watermen".
</li><li> Averted in one episode where he and Black Vulcan (who has <em>electricity powers</em>) go to save a nuclear submarine, and Aquaman utterly fails at being a help at all, mostly making things worse.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceColoringAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceColoringAdaptation">In fact the TV series is where most of the notion of Aquaman's uselessness comes from, due to the writers not being allowed to show him hitting anyone, so they were left with "being good at swimming" and "can ask fish for help."</a>
</li><li> The series' version of Black Manta has the same problem, with his character and ability set being reduced to "he owns a boat". In several episodes of the Legion of Doom era he and Aquaman have no purpose on their respective teams except to counter each other.
</li></ul></li><li> Zigzagged by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>. While Aqualad does only show up when the ocean is in trouble for the most part, he's proven that he's perfectly capable of fighting on dry land. (Most people tend to forget he's also got super strength - AND <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash">Hydrokinesis</a>.)
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTick">The Tick</a></em> had Arthur and the Tick follow the normally useless Sewer Urchin on a mission into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySpaciousSewer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySpaciousSewer">the sewers</a> where it turns out his abilities are phenomenally useful, he has a cool hideout, he is respected and feared by the natives, and he is unflappable in the face of the sewer's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashLure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashLure">strange</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlluringAnglerfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlluringAnglerfish">horrifying</a> obstacles. He describes himself as "the apotheosis of cool" in his realm.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em>:
<ul><li> Several characters have vehicle modes that are only useful in a severely limited number of situations. Seaspray's watercraft mode basically limits his usefulness to situations that take place on or around water <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6ccdq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6ccdq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6ccdq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">His actual vehicle mode was a hovercraft, so he could still function on dry land as long as it was flat enough terrain, but his skills were based on naval engagements</span>, much like Aquaman. Even more limited is Perceptor, whose alternate mode is a microscope, thus limiting his effectiveness to situations where things are found that need a microscope for evaluation. Every once in a while, they do get their opportunity to shine. Perceptor is also a scientist, not a warrior, so he's not very upset by his lack of a combat-oriented altmode. Later stories tend to point out that he's actually a Triple Changer; like his original toy, he can also become a tank (which basically just looks like the microscope with its scope pointing upward and treads folded out, but still). Several other characters avoid this trope by being able to ignore the limitations of their altmodes somehow (for instance, characters with train modes can drive around on flat ground).
</li><li> Overlapping with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenPhlebotinum">Forgotten Phlebotinum</a>, characters tend to forget certain powers or abilities to create these situations. For instance, in the second episode, all the Autobots could fly without assistance. In the third episode, only Sideswipe (whose toy bio gave him a rocket pack) could fly, so he could lend the rocket pack to Optimus and help save the day. On a similar note, the Decepticons can usually fly through space unassisted... except when Astrotrain (who turns into a space shuttle) is around, in which case they pile into him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em>'s third season featured four different episodes involving water-based setpieces, after the previous two seasons took place almost exclusively inland. Coincidentally, this was right after bounty hunter and aquatic specialist Depth Charge joined the team. By a similar coincidence, Depth Charge's rival Rampage had also picked up an aquatic altmode the season prior, giving them a lot of room for grudge matches. Like some modern Aquaman incarnations, Depth Charge wasn't by any means incompetent out of water, but his skillset would have been an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">Informed Ability</a> otherwise.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>:
<ul><li> Averted in that the Aqualad of this continuity can harden his water into solid objects like swords, have durability that can withstand Superboy's bounding, and electric eel tattoos on his body that can electrify the water. He was also the team's leader during the first season.
</li><li> However, Lagoon Boy in season 2 plays this trope straight. He lacks Aqualad's weapons and electrical abilities and so usually only gets used in missions near bodies of water. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesUnlimited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesUnlimited">Heroes Unlimited</a> nature of the second season makes this far less obvious, though. This does get a lampshade when Lagoon Boy whines about being "stereotyped as the water guy" but it's at least as much because he's obnoxious and annoying and no one really likes working with him unless the situation absolutely requires it.
</li><li> One episode features a villain plot to split the world of adults from the world of children (they've been essentially shunted into two separate dimensions). Captain Marvel's otherwise-useless (in this continuity, at least) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderAlterEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderAlterEgo">Older Alter Ego</a> becomes a way to bridge the gap and coordinate efforts between the adults and children.
