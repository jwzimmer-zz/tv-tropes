This is when the Stoic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheMask">loses their façade</a> and shows the world (or just their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>) that they aren't an emotionless automaton. They may be good at hiding it but they feel just as much as the rest of us. Likely to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">very heartwrenching</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">extremely terrifying</a> or <em>both</em>.
</p><p>In order to qualify, the show of emotion must be a significant one, not just a small smile or subtle frown. This emotion need not be a "negative" one: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears">Manly Tears</a> over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurHeroIsDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurHeroIsDead">the death of a teammate</a> are certainly un-stoic, but so is unfettered joy over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">their return</a>.
</p><p>These outpourings of emotion usually happen only a few times throughout the series — if the stoic is showing emotion every other episode in every season, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">they aren't much of a stoic</a>. However, these moments can also be used to illustrate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen">a character's growth towards becoming more open to others</a>, in which case displays of emotion — overt and subtle — would become more frequent over time.

Both times become memorably creepy for it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>:
<ul><li> Rei is heavily implied to have fallen in love with Shinji by the end. Either that, or developed motherly feelings for him since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she's partially a clone of his mother, and is choosing him over his father Gendo to become the "Messiah" of instrumentality in <em>End</em></span>.
</li><li> Gendo himself does this twice in the series proper. The first is when Rei's Eva goes berserk, and he severely burns his hands in his rush to get to her afterwards (opening the superheated release mechanism for her entry plug). The second time is when he orders the activation of Unit-01's dummy plug (autopilot) when his son's life (as well as the Eva, which contained the soul of his wife) was threatened by the 13th Angel. The look on his face shows it in the Japanese version, but the English dub has him swearing and yelling at his subordinates.
<ul><li> An interesting instance, as in the Rebuild, Gendo still orders the activation of the dummy plug but as the frenzied Evangelion proceeds to tear the Angel/Evangelion-03 to gibs, we see a satisfied smirk from Gendo in spite of the carnage that forces Maya to turn away and bury her face in her hands, and the others on the bridge to watch in silent horror. It is also one of the few (or possibly the only) time Gendo has ever really smiled since Yui died.
</li><li> In <em>End of Evangelion</em> Gendo flat out <em>panics</em> on a level not seen before when Rei <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">absorbs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">the Adam embryo in his hand</a> into herself and initiates Third Impact on her own</span> with both actors in English and Japanese making it clear from their tones of voice just how <em>screwed</em> Gendo knows he is now that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedTykebomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedTykebomb">Laser-Guided Tyke-Bomb</a> slash surrogate daughter slash clone of his dead wife has effectively told him to fuck off and die</span>. And in his final scene <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he flat out states that the reason he has been so distant to Shinji is that he was afraid he'd only hurt him.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Rei meanwhile looks at what happens with the dummy plugs, and she looks pretty freaked out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">(for her,)</a> at least as much as she does when she sees Shinji rip apart an Angel and it's hinted that she would find the truth about them horrifying enough to turn on Gendo.
</li><li> Let's not forget Ritsuko's breakdown in the Dummy Plug Plant, where she starts screaming and crying for her mother. Bear in mind she's somewhere between Rei and Gendo on the scale of stoic-ness. Ironically, her reaction upon realizing that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Caspar, the Magi who represents her mother as a woman, has chosen Gendo over her when she attempts a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Taking You with Me</a> by blowing them all up</span> is tearful but fairly composed after the initial shock wears off, with her simply stating "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatLiarLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatLiarLies">Liar</a>" in response to what Gendo tells her<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note04bph');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note04bph" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note04bph');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the exact words of which have only ever been revealed to the actress playing Ritsuko</span> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">before shooting her dead</span>.

<ul><li> The biggest example is Robin. She showed little to no emotion from the first time she was introduced as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> and continues being stoic even after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">joining the Straw Hats</a>. Then comes the CP9 saga, the majority of which is <em>dedicated</em> to this trope; when Robin's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a> past comes to bite her, she starts showing genuine fear, anger, and sadness. The apex comes after seeing her companions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreWorthHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreWorthHell">declare war on the World Government for her sake</a>, after which she tearfully screams "I WANT TO LIVE!" She goes back to being The Stoic at the arc's conclusion, though, as though nothing had ever happened...though she's gradually started showing more and more emotion since then.
<ul><li> And it seems that she's slowly slipping into a lesser Stoic status as of the Dressrosa arc: after several hundred chapters of being the calmest person in the world, she has finally adopted her crewmates' habit of showing overreactive faces. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Those dwarves just don't get it. And she has another, even <em>bigger</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildTake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildTake">Wild Take</a> a bit later in the same arc when talking with some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingToys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingToys">toy solders</a>.</span>
</li><li> Without saying a word, sometimes what she's thinking is shown to us through thought bubbles and the results usually range from goofy, odd, or cute. It's as though she says morbid things to throw people off about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">how lighthearted she actually is</a>.
</li><li> During the beginning of the Zou Arc, Kanjuro the samurai draws a pathetic-looking dragon and brings it to life. The Straw Hats dub it "Ryuunosuke" and in her mind, Robin refers to it as "cute" 3 times, all while <em>blushing</em>. Ryuunosuke had the task of climbing up to a very high destination with the Straw Hats and Law on its back. When they finally make it, Robin is driven to tears by the dragon's efforts to help them as it slowly bonds with the surface, reverting back into a drawing.
</li><li> The Wano arc takes this to a new level when Robin makes the same expression as Franky and Usopp when learning Luffy is in Wano (and already a wanted criminal). <a class="urllink" href="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/enh8osnwoaaipoz.jpg">As seen in here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>

This is because Zoro is SO STOIC that he can make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a> out of standing there, staring off into the distance, and saying "Nothing happened!" While covered in blood. Though as stoic as he is, he's had his fair share of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildTake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildTake">wild takes</a> alongside the other Straw Hats...except for Robin, of course.
</li><li> Marco, the first Commander of the Whitebeard Pirates, usually maintained a stoic reaction throughout the battle. However, he visibly lost his cool when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Whitebeard was stabbed by one of their allies, when Ace dies and when Whitebeard himself dies.</span>
</li><li> Jimbei is usually one of the most focused characters in the series.

<ul><li> He got another Wild Take when Luffy is more concerned about food than the important information Jimbei was telling him. After getting angry with Luffy who cheerfully tells him that he likes to leaves things to chance, Jimbei then goes into a minor depression.

Even then, it was only due to puzzlement. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Law cuts the SAD, Vergo, and practically the entire island of Punk Hazard, all while giving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewEraSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewEraSpeech">New Era Speech</a> to him,</span> Doflamingo actually <em>shows frustration</em> for the first time ever.
<ul><li> But that's merely the prelude of a massive symphony, the first movement of which comes when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Law gives him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">Sadistic Choice</a> after taking Caesar Clown hostage. He was stuck between a rock and a hard place: either he would give up his position as a Warlord and get Caesar back, or keep the position and be unable to produce SMILEs. If he takes the former, the Admirals won't stand idly by anymore and hunt him down. But if he takes the latter, he'll anger <em><strong>Kaido of the Four Emperors</strong></em> and get wiped out. After being given this choice, Doflamingo loses it and starts going on a rampage on Punk Hazard, slaughtering G-5 marines and giving Smoker a <em>severe</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No-Holds-Barred Beatdown</a>, all while demanding the heads of the Straw Hats and Law.</span>
</li><li> The next movement comes many chapters later when Doflamingo finds out that in spite of how smart he was, he severely underestimated exactly how massive of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">Spanner in the Works</a> the Straw Hats could be. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sugar, one of his crewmates whose Devil Fruit powers are the linchpin to maintaining his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a> over his kingdom, is knocked out, reversing her powers and exposing Doflamingo as the devilish man he is. His expression as everything he had worked for over the past decade comes crumbling down around him screams this trope, and the apex comes when he's taken by surprise and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead">decapitated</a></em> by Kyrosor rather, his doppelgänger is.</span>
</li><li> And the third movement comes when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Luffy and Law</span> confront him. At first, he's taking it as easily as he can under the circumstances; that is, he's gotten so frustrated that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughingMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughingMad">he's just laughing it off</a>. But then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a lengthy fight commences, and he finds himself victimized by a few sneak attacks before Law takes out his last and most powerful crewmate, and then he begins a fight with Luffy one-on-one. They're evenly matched for a whileup until Luffy unleashes his trump card, Gear Fourth, and turns it into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a>. And in the end, despite Doflamingo revealing all of the trump cards <em>he</em> had hidden, he loses.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Trafalgar Law is seen as a lesser example of The Stoic; he's smug, smiling, takes battles casually, and is not above showing emotion at times. However, he is unmistakably serious in all aspects, which leaves him rather bothered by the Straw Hats' quirks <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after they form an alliance. Examples include tying Chopper to his head, Luffy not following his plans, and the Straw Hats' absurdly nonchalant behavior in the calm before the storm. The first instance of this trope is shown after their victory on Punk Hazard when instead of fleeing, they throw a party. Law is shocked, but ultimately joins in, albeit <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mangahit.com/one-piece/696/18">managing to keep his Stoic appearance intact<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. 4 chapters later, however, when he realizes that he's grown too used to the Straw Hats' casual pace, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mangahit.com/one-piece/700/11">he is FLABBERGASTED.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></span>

</li><li> This happens again through Second Raid. Beginning when he was ordered to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> immediately cease guarding Kaname</span> and ending with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>another</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingSpeech">Breaking Speech</a> from Gauron</span>, he spiralled downhill into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement">10-Minute Retirement</a> and a full-blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a>.
</li><li> Interestingly enough, in the anime, he <em>never</em> cries. However, in the novel, he <em>does</em> break down crying and showing vulnerability... <em>not</em> over Kaname, <em>not</em> over any of his comrades dying... but over his shame and hurt pride that the hostage situation (during the Behemoth Arc) failed to go the way he planned.
</li><li> On a smaller scale, he also unintentionally breaks his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">stoic</a> image by, amazingly enough, acting like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> in regard to Kaname. During the party on the Tuatha De Dannan, Kurz tells Sousuke, "She's pretty, cute, and has a nice sense of style. <em>Any</em> man would fall for her in an instant." Sousuke quickly and coldly responds, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsNotMyGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsNotMyGirlfriend">I wouldn't know. I'm not interested.</a>" Certainly a response very unlike his normal stoic, clueless attitude.
</li><li> <em>Fumoffu?</em> has several examples, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>.

Luckily for the "kidnapper" in question, he was wrong.
</li><li> A massive example comes right at the end of the series: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sosuke is stranded at ground zero of an incoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">nuclear missile</a> and has accepted his fate. But then his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> receives a transmission: a video message from his high school classmates, thanking him for saving their lives and reminding him of his promise to return to school along with Kaname. This makes Sosuke break down crying and declaring that he wants to live, which leads to his mecha's AI trying something that ends up saving them both.</span>
</li><li> <em>The Second Raid</em> has Sousuke show his trust towards Kaname by letting her cut his hair. Let's review it: a teenage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">Child Soldier</a> conditioned to perceive everyone as a potential enemy is letting another person handle scissors near his head and behind his back (falling asleep in the process).

</li><li> The Shinigami/Reaper is a quirky example. While not exactly stoic, he usually brushes off any and all situations by being/looking/talking/acting goofy, putting him firmly in comic relief territory. That is, until the Kishin gets loose. Just as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is about to flee outright, the Reaper shows up. There's some brief banter, where the Kishin calls the Reaper out on his goofiness, to which the Reaper offers some terse explanation and cuts loose. His voice drops to a low growl, his goofy mask takes on a thoroughly pissed off expression (which is actually more effective than his previous "scary face"), he actually starts swearing at the Kishin and shows everyone exactly why he's the boss.
</li><li> To be reminded that the Cloudcuckoolander and the usually low-key boy are father and son, just point out something (significant) which goes against their sense of order. Kid also counts for the moments when his calm, matter-of-fact attitude towards being a god is broken by his occasionally hysterical concerns over not being a '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">'good enough''</a> god.

Although the heroes are forced to fight him in order to win the cup he doesn't hold this against them, actually helping his rival Mocchi improve his skills and trying to persuade him to forfeit the match as Most was worried about hurting him.

Thus, they act <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stoic">stoic</a> most of the the time, but there's usually that <em>one</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">thing</a> that gets a rise out of them. Particularly memorable moments included Hei completely flipping out at the mention of his sister and the time when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl">Yin</a> started crying.
<ul><li> Hei's character tends to play around with this trope. Compared to other contractors, he's extremely empathetic towards the people around him, and is known to act irrationally based on his feelings.
</li><li> For a human example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairCop">Kirihara</a> starts crying when she hears her team laughing and talking about how they'll support the chief and catch the villain without realizing that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> their section has been disbanded.</span>

It is very obvious that she cares about him though, and she holds his hand while walking down the street with him and Nagi.
<ul><li> Rather than "distant and aloof", she was more nervous and awkward having absolutely no idea how to treat her own child. Regardless, this still underlines her graduation from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">The Stoic</a>.

She comes to love it so much that she considers settling down and living there. Eventually, however, the townspeople begin insisting that she leaves, to the point that they all but force her to. Reluctantly, she complies, only to end up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">watching from a safe distance as a volcano erupts, completely destroying the town and killing everyone in it...including the aforementioned adorable girl.

Zabuza spent the entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a> priding himself on being an emotionless killing machine, but in spite of himself flat-out <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears">cried</a></em> when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Haku died</span>.

I think I'm sensing a theme.
</li><li> Gaara gets a special mention. When he's first introduced, he speaks in a dull monotone and barely shows any reaction to, well, anything. This seemingly impenetrable stoicism is shattered spectacularly when he wakes up Shukaku for his fight with Rock Lee, and later, Sasuke and Naruto; and also when he tries to deal with Might Guy's defense of Rock Lee and his horrible emotional background (thank you, Yashamaru). Sasuke making him bleed for the first time got quite the reaction. He's also had his moments post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, such as when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he broke down in tears when his temporarily revived father told him that his mother <em>did</em> love him, contrary to what he was told.</span>

</li><li> Sasuke, calm and cool in almost any sitution, even when all the other characters are panicking, laughing uncontrollably, or cheering.

</li><li> Kakashi is for the most part very stoic, never really shedding tears at the mention of his dead father and closest friends, but read/watch the Kakashi Gaiden special, especially the end where he breaks down crying at the death of Obito. It's truly heartbreaking to see that. In chapters 599 and on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kakashi discovers just who Tobi actually is—his old teammate Obito—which leaves him completely shocked to the point where</span> Guy actually has to shake him back to the real world.

When Inugami shows him just how powerless he really is, Haguro starts busting out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile">Slasher Smiles</a> like nobody's business and goes on a psychopathic rampage that still shows no signs of stopping, all to regain his original image as a "monster."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolRumble">School Rumble</a></em>'s later chapters, we learn that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Karasuma</span>'s lack of facial expressions was all an act. Once he <em>does</em> start showing emotions, he becomes <em>almost unrecognizable</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl">Mai</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Kanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Kanon">Kanon</a></em> is very much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">The Stoic</a> at first, and seems pretty much emotionless up until the middle of her story arc.

<ul><li> Paul normally has a scowl as his trademark expression with a condescending smirk or intense concentration thrown in during a few battles. The one time that he has ever flipped out completely is in <em>A Pyramiding Rage!</em> when he battled Brandon and Brandon kept knocking out his Pokémon with no sign of his even taking damage.
</li><li> Nando the Pokémon minstrel, in his early appearances, was so calm and polite that even getting arrested and framed for robbery failed to rile him. Then came the Grand Festival, where when Zoey begins shutting down his combinations, he drops the facade and gets even <em>more</em> intense than she is.
</li><li> Hun from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLegendOfThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLegendOfThunder">The Legend of Thunder!</a></em> likewise. Usually he remains calm and blah, including telling his partner to stop joking around. Then the fighting starts and he gets, shall we say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">into it</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Van of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GunXSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GunXSword">GUN×SWORD</a></em> has a sort of breakdown after facing a particularly powerful enemy. Not only does he show real fear for what may be the only time in the series, but the breakdown leads him to finally talk to his closest companion about his horrible past and his love for his dead fiancee. During this conversation, his voice shakes, his hand trembles, and he covers his face in a gesture more heart-wrenching than tears would have been.
</li><li> Ai Emna of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl">Hell Girl</a></em> is usually the picture of stoic, bordering on being emotionless.

</li><li> Haku from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpiritedAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpiritedAway">Spirited Away</a></em> is normally calm and emotionless, even when Yubaba was breathing fire inches away from his face and wrapping her hair around his neck and body. But when he is around Chihiro, he reveals many more emotions, such as concern, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">a hint of snarkiness</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenSheSmiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenSheSmiles">happiness.</a>

<ul><li> Episode 10 puts all of that into heartbreaking perspective. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Homura was once a cute, glasses-wearing, dorky <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Shrinking Violet</a>.

It's clear that she's crying on the inside.</span>
</li><li> A lesser example, also from episode 10. Mami, who is second only to Homura in the stoic department, snaps into a sobbing mess when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Sayaka of that time line turns into a witch. She so breaks from the revelation that they'll all eventually become witches, that she shoots Kyoko's soul gem, killing her, and would have killed Homura too, had Madoka not killed her first.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Barnaby of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny">Tiger &amp; Bunny</a></em> is normally a very restrained individual, but after the discovery and subsequent loss of a lead on the organization responsible for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his parents' murder</span> he completely loses it — physically attacking his partner Kotetsu, snapping at everyone who talks to him, and briefly going AWOL before his mentor manages to get a hold of him and calm him down. Likewise, any mention of his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">parents' killer</span> makes him almost unrecognizable in his fury.
<ul><li> From episode 18 onwards the story is littered with such moments on Barnaby's part — so much so that it counts as a complete subversion of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoicSpectacles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoicSpectacles">Stoic Spectacles</a> archetype he previously represented; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScream">the screaming</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a> of ep.18, a number of crying (nay, <em>sobbing</em>) scenes in ep. 19, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenderTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenderTears">Tender Tears</a> in ep.s 20, 24 &amp; 25.

Except when it involves his father. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Who was undercover for most of Ken's life. Then killed for real before the two could develop any sort of relationship. And angered Ken enough that he dragged the entire team into an enemy trap.</span>
</li><li> Guts is stoic to point of lacking emotions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>, until he becomes a member of the Band of the Hawk. He finally begins to open up, but his emotions are mainly limited to mirth and anger, never showing anything tender. Then, during a touching scene when he and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Casca</span> make love, he breaks down completely and despairs over his abusive relationship with his stepfather. The following night, he has another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic">Not So Stoic</a> moment when he finds Griffith in the dungeon and sees the horrible suffering that had been inflicted on his friend.
</li><li> Although Holo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SpiceAndWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SpiceAndWolf">Spice and Wolf</a></em> may not seem stoic at first glance, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster">trickster</a> and teasing antics cover serious issues. It's almost impossible to tell what she's really thinking... unless she's shocked into dropping her act, and as Lawrence quickly learns, what's she's usually thinking is something like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleaseDontLeaveMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleaseDontLeaveMe">Please Don't Leave Me</a>."
</li><li> Erza from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> has had quite a few moments, both comedic (the play episode) and dramatic (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Tower of Heaven arc, anyone?</span>).
</li><li> Vincent Nightray of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PandoraHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PandoraHearts">PandoraHearts</a></em> usually manages to keep up his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil">cheerful disposition</a> quite flawlessly, even while <em>torturing and killing</em> people. The first time his facade slips, which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, is when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna">Ada</a> introduces him to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFetishist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFetishist">special collection</a>. The second time is much more serious: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vincent confronts Duke Nightray after Elliot's death and loses his temper when the duke doesn't express any remorse over his son's death. Vincent beheads Duke Nightray along with his two bodyguards, thereby ending the legitimate Nightray bloodline.

</li><li> Louise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero">The Familiar of Zero</a></em> gets this during the rescuing of the Staff of Destruction in the first season. When Louise tries to defeat the giant golem and is more of a hindrance than anything what with her spells not doing any damage and Saito having to push her out of the way of an attack by the golem, Saito tries to get her to leave and run to safety, which she absolutely flat out refuses to do and tells Saito to let her continue, despite both of them knowing she's doing nothing to help. After a wake up slap, Saito tells her that her life isn't worth anything if she throws it away on pride, where upon Louise immediately breaks down and admits the reason she doesn't want to quit is that all the bullying due to the lack of talent and constant explosions from failed spells really has gotten to her deep down, and in reality, she is outwardly tough but inwardly she's emotionally damaged from verbal bullying, name-calling, and her own failings as a mage, and doesn't want to be labeled a coward on top of already being labeled as a no-talent mage, and even admits that in reality the name Louise The Zero "hurts (her) feelings" despite her visually brushing it off until this point. This doesn't change her personality in the slightest, however, but at least the audience has an explanation for some of it.
</li><li> Also could count in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> when the typically hardass Sailor Uranus <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> witnesses her lover, Sailor Neptune get her heart stolen and die in front of her,</span> while Uranus doesn't break down or cry, for the first time in the series she looks truly heartbroken. She then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> attempts to kill herself. (Whether that action was performed due to anguish and desire to follow her girlfriend into death, or purely for the sake of the mission is never fully clarified</span>
</li><li> Crown Prince Kouen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagiLabyrinthOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagiLabyrinthOfMagic">Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic</a></em> is normally very emotionless, even when his stepmother Gyokuen flirted aggressively with him, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gyokuen succeeded his father before him</span> and when half of his body was burned away by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Medium</span>.

</li><li> Tsukasa in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DrStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DrStone">Dr. Stone</a></em> is often cool-headed and in control. Though he reacts to Taiju's stupidity (these are removed in the anime). After he's revived a second time later on, he immediately asks Senku "what's the situation". Everyone comments that Tsukasa always keeps his cool. Senku tells him that they're going to the moon, causing Tsukasa to lose his cool.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>'s biggest weak points as far as emotion goes are his children, but especially Dick. At one point, when exposed to the Scarecrow's fear toxin, he runs through his worst fears checklist in an almost bored manner, with everyone close to him dying. Then it comes to Dick, and Batman's only response is a very determined "No."
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ADeathInTheFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ADeathInTheFamily">A Death in the Family</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanUnderTheRedHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanUnderTheRedHood">Batman: Under the Red Hood</a></em>, Batman's expression on his face of shock, horror, and sadness after Jason Todd's death speaks for itself.
</li><li> Pretty much in any continuity, anything involving his parents (especially if it involves their deaths), Alfred, or any of the Robins (Dick mainly) is bound to get a rise out of him emotionally, not always in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a> way, sometimes in a Heartwarming way as well.

</li><li> In one instance, Batman was talking with Catwoman after the Gang War storyline, which devastated the city <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and left two of his allies dead</span>. Angry at his casual reaction to it, Catwoman starts holding him, yelling "Feel! Feel something, damn it!". Bruce just pulls her into a hug and says "Selina... I feel <strong>everything</strong>". Not a big show of emotion, but it certainly illustrates the point.
</li><li> In "Mad Love", Batman apparently bursts out in hysterical laughter at the thought of Harley Quinn actually winning the love of the Joker. In this case, he was deliberately doing it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">play on Harley's insecurities</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">It worked, too.</a>

It's more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">laughter of the damned</a>, but it's still real laughter.
</li><li> The Trope Image is from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Knightfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Knightfall">Knightfall</a></em>, just after Batman has to be stopped from smashing Zsasz's head in like a watermelon.

</li><li> Batman rogue Mr. Freeze is, as befits a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson">cold</a></em>-themed character, usually grim and without empathy.

</li><li> Desire in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman">The Sandman</a></em> just seems amused most of the time.

<ul><li> In a way, though, the shifting expressions on his masks represent different emotions. Probably.
</li><li> Also worthy of note is his infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> when he realizes that a criminal has kidnapped, raped, killed a nine-year-old, and <em>fed her body to his dogs</em>. He slams an axe into the rapist's skull while screaming angrily at him (audio implies that he's crying).

</li><li> Doctor Manhattan is a subversion, he seems stoic to the point of alienation which makes the moment where he is angry or happy stick out but Ozymandias says to someone experienced in reading body language or psychology Jon was continuously sad, he just couldn't weep like a human does.

Then when they regain their powers they're ten times stronger, with Scott now having full control.

The most dramatic one is in "The Three Garridebs" (quoted above) when Watson gets shot by the villain of the week, and Holmes practically has a panic attack over it before declaring he would have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">murdered the shooter himself</a> if Watson had died. Watson even comments that it was worth getting shot just to see Holmes acting so uncharacteristically emotional.
<ul><li> A more comedic example occurs in "The Man With The Twisted Lip": Holmes has been hired to find a woman's missing husband and all the evidence points to the man having been murdered. He breaks the news to his employer in the most sympathetic yet professional manner... and the woman replies that her husband can't be dead because she's just received a letter from him. Holmes springs out of his chair and shouts "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigWhat">WHAT?</a>"
</li><li> In "The Devil's Foot," Holmes makes the rather unwise decision to find out whether an unknown substance is poisonous by testing it on himself and Watson. They both nearly die, only escaping thanks to some quick action on Watson's part. Afterward Holmes rather emotionally thanks Watson for saving his life and apologizes for subjecting him to such a stupid experiment. Once again, Watson seems to feel the whole thing was worth it just to see Holmes acting human for once.

Or are you as cold and unfeeling as you seem? <br/><strong>Brennan:</strong> <em>[in a raw emotional tone]</em> I see a face on every skull. I can look at their bones and tell you how they walked, where they hurt. Maggie Schilling is real to me. The pain she suffered was real. Her hip was being eaten away by infection from lying on her side. Sure, like Dr. Stires said, the disease could contribute to that if you take it out of context; but you cant break Maggie Schilling down into little pieces. She was a whole person who fought to free herself. Her wrists were broken from struggling against the handcuffs. The bones in her ankles were ground together because her feet were tied. And her side, her hip, and her shoulder were being eaten away by infection. And the more she struggled, the more pain she was in. So they gave her those drugs to keep her quiet. They gave her so much it killed her. These facts can't be ignored or dismissed because you think I'm boring or obnoxious, because I don't matter. What I feel doesnt matter. Only she matters; only Maggie.

She even keeps hearing the woman's recorded voice as her own and seeing herself in all the pictures of the victim. She realizes that she has screwed up her one chance to be happy with Booth. This episode is all about her stoicism slowly slipping.
</li><li> Interestingly played with in the season 7 finale when Brennan is being framed for the murder of the victim of the week. Brennan remains hyper-logical throughout, while other characters fall apart. It's pretty predictable that Booth and Angela will get emotional, but when Cam starts crying because she doesn't want to turn over evidence that will get Brennan arrested, you know the situation is serious.

However, Rose's touch also fundamentally alters its DNA and gives it the capacity to feel, which drives the alien into an existential crisis—it wants freedom and a purpose beyond thoughtless rage, but also knows that it is no longer a "pure" Dalek and, thanks to centuries of mental conditioning, immediately decides to kill itself for this "crime." Since it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICannotSelfTerminate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICannotSelfTerminate">can't kill itself without being ordered to do so</a>, it demands that Rose command it; when she does, it chokes out a heartbreaking set of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousLastWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousLastWords">Famous Last Words</a>:

<div class="indent"><strong>Teal'c:</strong> If you are to die, Daniel Jackson, I wish you to know that I believe that the fight against the Goa'uld will have lost one of its greatest warriors. And I will have lost one of my greatest friends.

<div class="indent"><strong>Carter:</strong> We were a <em>team</em>, Teal'c. No-one can even begin to understand what we went through together, what we mean to each other. So maybe Daniel <em>has</em> achieved something of great cosmic significance, I don't know. And to be honest with you, right now, I don't really care.

</div></li><li> It is very subtle, but in "Cor-Ai", when Teal'c and Jack are arguing over whether or not he should defend himself while being tried for the many horrible things he did for the Goa'uld, you can see Teal'c's jaw trembling with suppressed anger at himself.
</li><li> Teal'c's façade actually cracks a little in the very first episode. O'Neill sees that Teal'c is struggling to carry out the vicious acts demanded of him by the Goa'uld. This prompts O'Neill to seeks Teal'c's help in escaping, and kicks off the rest of the show.

"Jim!" It is notable for coming genuinely from Spock himself, and not being a result of mind control, drugs, or a strange phenomenon.
<ul><li> Spock again in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS1E4TheNakedTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS1E4TheNakedTime">The Naked Time</a>", although that <em>was</em> the result of a strange phenomenon. At least he was able to duck into a room before he fell to pieces.
</li><li> In the ending of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS2E11FridaysChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS2E11FridaysChild">Friday's Child</a>", Spock is visibly shocked to learn that the newborn Teer of Capella IV has been named Leonard James Akaar in honor of Bones and Kirk, and expresses dismay that the two gentlemen will be "insufferably pleased with [them]selves for at least a month... <em>sir</em>."
</li><li> Vulcans developed their culture of tightly controlled emotions to deal with the fact that they are really <em>very</em> emotional, and without strict discipline, they tend to overreact to everything. Indeed, before Surak proposed his philosophy of strict self-control, Vulcan society was about to completely destroy itself. Under sufficiently extreme circumstances, a Vulcan's self-control can be broken (usually only temporarily), and everyone around will be reminded that under that stern calm face lies a turbulent sea of emotions that would drive the less-disciplined completely mad.
<ul><li> They also get really violent and horny during Pon Farr, basically Vulcans in heat.
</li><li> Also, Spock is only half-Vulcan, as his mother was human.
</li><li> If you want to imagine what Vulcans would be like if they gave into their emotions, one need look no further than the highly paranoid and extremely dangerous Romulan Empire, which spawned at least one planet-destroying and truly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy">Axe-Crazy</a> psychopath, Nero.
</li><li> Romulans serve more as evidence that the Vulcan emotional problems may be something of a self-fulfilling prophecy, as Romulans don't suppress their emotions and few of them are shown to be any more volatile than an average human (possibly even less so).
</li><li> Vulcans and Romulans being much stronger than the average human does not help matters either. Kirk has had to provoke Spock into an emotional display in both the original series and the new movie continuity, and both times Spock nearly killed him. Even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Khan</span> is no match for a pissed-off Spock in a straight-up fistfight, and he <em>knows</em> it, running away as soon as Spock shows up.

Data's lack of emotion is a frequent plot point in the series. With a few notable exceptions. In "The Most Toys", he was almost driven to murder (and then <em>lied</em> about it to his commanding officer) and again in "Descent: Part I", when manipulated by his more emotional brother, causing him to kill a Borg drone in rage. Even he seems rather bewildered by this just afterward: "I got angry."
<ul><li> One of the subplots of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">Generations</a></em> is Data deciding to reinstall the emotion chip given to him in the above episode, and dealing with the resulting outbursts. At the end, he discovers that his pet cat is still alive and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsOfJoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsOfJoy">begins to cry</a>, which he assumes must be a malfunction of the chip. Troi assures him with a smile that "it's working just fine."
</li><li> The episode "Sarek" dealt with this with the eponymous character (Spock's father, of course), whose emotional control was breaking down due to a rare illness. Determined to finish his last mission, he melds with Picard, who is normally very emotionally controlled in his own right, allowing Sarek to be himself again long enough to finish the negotiations. But we also see the effects of Sarek's illness in Picard.
<ul><li> Part of the effects of the mind meld with Picard are to subject an unprepared human mind to the powerful raw emotions of a Vulcan. Having not been raised from birth to learn to control those emotions, Picard spends the duration of the experience practically rabid, suggesting what pre-Surak Vulcans were like.
</li><li> Look at Sarek in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIIITheSearchForSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIIITheSearchForSpock">The Search for Spock</a></em>. He's downright pissed off when he thinks <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kirk has Spock's <em>katra</em> and screwed up by leaving Spock's body on Genesis</span>. He's so overtly emotional it seems to surprise Kirk quite a bit.
</li></ul></li><li> Picard has his moments as well, particularly in "Family", <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations">Generations</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact">First Contact</a></em>.

Although Solok was pretty blatant about it from the first, with a permanent air of smug superiority and barely constrained sarcasm more like a typical Romulan than anything.

<ul><li> A more frequent example might come from the character Odo, particularly concerning his initially unrequited love for Kira.

</li><li> The Geth teammate Legion also has shades of this. Occasionally, his "I'm an emotionless robot" facade cracks, such as when confronted with betrayal or unpleasant revelations, when asked pointed questions about his illogical behavior, or when <a class="urllink" href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Shadow_Broker_Dossiers/Legion">playing Galaxy of Fantasy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

A FemShep romancing Garrus will literally be on the edge of tears when talking to Garrus right before the final push-this war has beaten her to the bone, and what little left of her is <em>depending</em> on her friends and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance">Turian</a> she loves to see this through to the end.

This is doubly poignant because Mordin previously used passive voice and clinical language to downplay his own guilt in the genophage upgrade, so it's a big surprise to hear him take <em>personal</em> responsibility for it. Normally, he would say something like <em>"Mistakes were made"</em>, but he doesn't — it was <em>his</em> mistake, <em>he</em> did it, and he knows it.
</li><li> Legion has a much more dramatic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic">Not So Stoic</a> moment in 3 compared to his emotional reactions in 2 if you refuse to risk the lives of the attacking Quarians by letting him upload the Reaper Code to save the Geth. The first refusal has Legion attempt to appeal to Shepard's reason with real desperation in its voice, saying <em>"This is not justice!"</em>. If Shepard refuses, however, Legion nearly <em>kills</em> them in a fury equal to Wrex's.

While his sudden violent outbursts could be viewed as rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">Narm</a> at times, Asbel is usually left gaping in disbelief at him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's a result of him being possessed by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a>.</span>

Snake, knowing he'll die soon tries to discourage Raiden from following him, but the badly injured Raiden drags himself along the floor and desperately clutches Snake's leg, begging him not to leave him alone after having lost his parents, his innocence due to his child soldier days, his love and his child.

She manages to hold it together pretty well, but there are two occasions where it slips a little; first, when she sees a portrait of her parents, the implications and stress of what has already happened drive her to faint and have nightmares. The second time is if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Garry fails the Doll Room event, and is driven insane. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">Depending on circumstances</a>, it'll either be a heart-warming hug when Ib manages to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan">snap him back to reality</a>, or she'll rocket past the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a> fast enough that her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByDespair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByDespair">will to live shatters like glass</a> when she realises he's past saving</span>.

</li><li> Balthier in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em> is full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">snark and wit</a>, even when he has a sword pointed directly at his neck. Nothing ever makes the man flinch and he always keeps his cool. The moment someone brings up nethicite or the laboratory within the empire's home city, Balthier drops the act and becomes more upfront and direct, which surprised everyone when he started to act as such towards Larsa after the kid mentioned the subject. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> At the Phon Coast, he becomes very open with Ashe and tells her how his father became extremely obsessed with nethicite to the point that it was all the scientist cared about.

</li><li> GLaDOS in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal">Portal</a></em> is a stoic, if quirky, AI that instructs you on the test chambers. Once you start going off the rails after she tries to dump you in a fire pit, her stoicism starts to crack as she tries to beg you to come back while hurling passive aggressive remarks at you. She also breaks down further in her boss fight when you rip out her cores one by one. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2">Portal 2</a></em>, GLaDOS has a mixture of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a> with passive aggressiveness towards you throughout your journey by constantly reminding you of what you did to her in the last game.

However, he does become obviously upset when he thinks that Rose is about to go on a suicide mission. (Later, during Act 6, he gradually gives up the cool-guy act and becomes more emotionally open.)
</li><li> Rose Lalonde's demeanor was cracked <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> with the death of her mother</span> where she immediately blamed herself. Her level of sanity after she goes Grimdark is questionable, but she was fairly stable until Jack <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> killed John</span> where she then attacked him in an eldritch rage. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> During the Meteor intermission she begins drinking</span> she's less guarded but also falls into an inept stoop.

He does, occasionally, get moments of emotion, but his first true Not So Stoic moment happened in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerbTheMovieAcrossThe2ndDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerbTheMovieAcrossThe2ndDimension">his first</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">movie</a>: When he and his brother meet their other-dimension counterparts, the alternate Phineas sees Perry and immediately hugs him, thinking he's <em>their</em> Perry, finally come home. When Phineas tells him that it's the wrong Perry, he then asks "Wait...can I hold him a little longer?". Cut to Ferb, along with <em>his</em> other dimension counterpart, shedding a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleTear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleTear">single</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears">small tear</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em> has Jack himself, who is usually a calm and composed individual. The two things that have made him lose his temper were the Scotsman and Ashi. Notably, in both instances, he finally lost his temper after being insulted for an extended period of time.
</li><li> Craig from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> briefly loses his temper during an argument with Tweek in "Put it Down". He lampshades it himself right afterwards.
<div class="indent"><strong>Craig:</strong> Well, I'm sorry that I'm actually in control of my goddamn emotions, you baby! *<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">Beat</a>* Oh, see? Now you made me lose control of <em>my</em> emotions. Goddammit.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> Garnet tends to be unfazed by most things. She becomes more expressive as the series progresses, ranging from desperation (when Steven nearly ages himself to death in "Too Many Birthdays", or when he endangers himself during "Future Vision" because of something she told him), to unrestrained joy (seeing that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Steven and Connie have pulled off a successful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">Fusion Dance</a></span> in "Alone Together", or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">fusing back together herself</span> in "Jail Break"), to rage (after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pearl</span> violates her trust in "Cry For Help", or when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Peridot</span> squanders what little goodwill she had in "It Could've Been Great"). The most dramatic case comes in "Keeping it Together"; confronting <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the artificial gem <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">assembled from the shards of fallen comrades</a></span> elicits absolute <em>horror</em>.
</li><li> Sapphire, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one of Garnet's component gems</span>, is always calm and emotionless to the point of appearing apathetic, a side effect of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seers">being able to look into the future</a>. This comes back to haunt her in "Keystone Motel"; when she and Ruby are upset by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pearl</span>'s actions in the previous episode, she refuses to acknowledge her own present emotional state, as well as Ruby's. When she realizes how much it's affected the pair (as well as Steven), she breaks down:
<div class="indent"><strong>Sapphire:</strong> I keep looking into the future, when all of this has already been solved. As if it doesn't matter how you feel in the present. <em>(voice cracking as she starts crying)</em> No wonder you think I don't care!
</div><ul><li> When she (as part of Garnet) learns that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rose Quartz was actually a shapeshifted Pink Diamond for all the millennia she had known and followed her</span>, Sapphire understandably, yet rather uncharacteristically, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><strong>flips out in rage and warps out of the temple,</strong> leaving Ruby and the other Crystal Gems behind</span>.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Sapphire:</strong> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">SHE <em>LIED</em> TO US!!! SHE LIED ABOUT EVERYTHING!</span>
</div></li><li> In a different vein, Peridot is introduced as a technician on a routine assignment, and her inflections and expression border on mechanical. In subsequent appearances, she gets rather amusingly flustered when others meddle in her business ("I'M REPORTING THIS!"), and she becomes slowly unhinged <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after being stranded on Earth</span>, ending up a nervous wreck by the time the Crystal Gems finally track her down.
</li><li> When Peridot's finally able to contact her leader, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yellow Diamond</span> reprimands her for falling behind schedule, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">losing her ship and her escort</span>, and using an emergency contact rather than proper channels, but then goes on to calmly thank her for completing her report, and offers to arrange transport to bring her home. Only after Peridot stumbles across her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">suggesting they spare Earth from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomsdayDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomsdayDevice">Doomsday Device</a> they'd planted, and questioning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason">her motives</a> when she dismisses the idea</span>) does her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsPetty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsPetty">vindictive streak</a> become apparent. By the end of their conversation, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal">Peridot denounces her</a> in a moment of desperation</span>, she is <em>furious</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan">Sym-Bionic Titan</a></em>, Lance starts out as quiet, serious, and aloof, but goes through this trope as more of a gradual change as opposed to facing consequences that briefly put him into this. Octus, a robot, is stoic throughout most of the show, but when all organic life becomes still due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Mutraddi</a>, he attempts to use his electricity to bring Ilana and Lance "back to life." When it does work, he actually smacks his hand across this face, making this pained expression as if he was going to cry.
</li><li> Raven of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> strives for utter calm and control over her emotions—making it that much more frightening when she lets her temper show. The episode "Nevermore" begins with Raven torturing a villain, and the fourth season's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfArcSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfArcSeason">Trigon arc</a> features her angrily attacking and yelling at both Slade and Trigon.
<ul><li> Justified, though, because it was mentioned once in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip">"Freaky Friday" Flip</a> episode "Switched" that her powers are controlled by her emotions. Cue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveFreak">Starfire</a> exploding things without noticing when she had Raven's body, or Raven accidentally kidnapping all other Titans and creating an army of monsters when she was scared by a horror movie.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em> Noah was an emotionless, sarcastic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a>, however, in <em>World Tour</em> he gets some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> and focus that reveals that he's quite enthusiastic and friendly when he wants to be.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em>:
<ul><li> Very few things can make Prowl of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> lose his composure. Unfortunately for Prowl, one of those things is his annoying teammate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidAppealCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidAppealCharacter">Bumblebee</a>, who can provoke uncharacteristic displays of frustration in Prowl without even trying.
</li><li> It is rare to see Optimus Prime from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em> to show any sort of emotion. He only really loses it twice: once when Raph is injured by Megatron, and once when Starscream steals the Omega Keys.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>, Batman is still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">The Stoic</a>, but he shows a lot more emotion around Dick and the rest of the team, at least moreso than most of his other appearances. The most heartwarming is the moment after Dick gets jealous of Aqualad, he "trains" Dick by playing a one-on-one game of basketball with him.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder20');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder20" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Norwegian Terrorist and mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik bragged about how he had trained himself to disregard any and all emotion and described himself as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a>. This, however, did not stop him from writing a 27-page long list of complaints on his prison cell surroundings, like how the pen he was given caused his hands to hurt and how he could not bring his own Vacuum Flask.
<ul><li> Among other things, he wants a sofa, a PS3, and some adult-rated games for it (currently, he's "only" got a chair, a PS2 and games rated as appropriate for all ages). <a class="urllink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/anders-breivik-demands-better-video-games-and-threatens-hunger-strike-over-jail-hell-9130592.html">He claims he is being treated like an animal and is threatening a hunger strike<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It's been suggested, with some good evidence, that he's mainly doing this out of spite.
</li><li> Breivik had made his own vid, explaining his views, and this was propped up with sufficient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicToInvadePolandTo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicToInvadePolandTo">Music to Invade Poland To</a>. When this was shown during his trial, the hardened murderer broke down in tears, overwhelmed by his own "heroism".
</li></ul></li><li> Newscasters are supposed to be stoic, and Dan Rather has been exceptional in this regard, reporting on everything from the assassination of John F. Kennedy (as CBS's Dallas correspondent) up to the events of 9/11—at least in his own newscast. However, he was very humanly emotional when he was David Letterman's first guest when Letterman's show returned after 9/11.
<ul><li> Bosses and other authority figures are also supposed to be stoic and not let others — particularly their subordinates — into their private lives, particularly the more traditional ones. But every once in awhile, even the most traditional of superiors will let their iron-clad facade fall.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhTheHumanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhTheHumanity">Oh, the Humanity!</a> is an earlier case of this. After calmly narrating the Hindenburg's approach to the mooring tower, newsreel announcer Herbert Morrison was horrified and at a loss for words when it caught fire.
</li><li> Walter Cronkite briefly lost his composure on the air when he reported the official statement that John F Kennedy had died. (Video <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuxLSY_xNwA">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the composure slip starts at just about 5:00)
<ul><li> His facade also briefly parted during liftoff and ascent of John Glenn's Mercury space-capsule flight. And when the Apollo 11 astronauts landed on the moon, he was positively giddy.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s reaction to the question of whether <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UweBoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UweBoll">Uwe Boll</a> would be making a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em> movie was supposedly... spirited, to say the least.
</li><li> Two-time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a> champion Mika Hakkinen, like many Finnish drivers, was considered to be stoic to a fault... until the 1999 Italian Grand Prix when, in the midst of a fierce championship battle, Hakkinen selected the wrong gear and span off, retiring from the lead. In full view of the TV cameras, the normally ice-cool Finn threw his steering wheel at the ground and ran off to cry in the bushes.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1dtee');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1dtee" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1dtee');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Hakkinen did win the championship that year, by just two points.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis">Tennis</a> player Andy Murray has a reputation as being quite stoic and serious...until he lost in the finals of Wimbledon 2012, and had to fight tears most of the way throughout his final speech.
<ul><li> Roger Federer has an even more established reputation as a cool and unflappable maestro who never lets a strand of his hair get out of place on court, but he occasionally does things like breaking down in tears after losing the 2009 Australian Open final and <a class="urllink" href="http://tennis.si.com/2012/06/05/roger-federer-french-open-crowd/">yelling at the French Open crowd to "Shut up!"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> while on the brink of getting eliminated by del Potro that remind you that he's just as human as the next player.
</li></ul></li><li> ABC News anchor Peter Jennings was known to be as charismatic as possible without losing his journalistic cool. He'd been in the business since the mid-1960s so he knew to be a consummate pro. But when he told his viewing audience about his cancer diagnosis (of a cancer that would eventually take his life) and need to retire, you could hear his voice cracking and his eyes full of sadness.
</li><li> The head of the stoic school, Chrysippus, was an example: He died in a fit of uncontrollable laughter.
</li><li> MMA fighter Ronda Rousey is always extremely cold and composed in the lead up to her matches, complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare">death glares</a>. Once she has won she instantly becomes much more relaxed and shows more personality. How she would react if she lost is unclear as of yet...
<ul><li> As of her November 15, 2015 loss to Holly Holm, we now know that she reacts poorly. Rousey has yet to return to competition.

</li><li> Real-world <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishRoyalGuards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishRoyalGuards">British Royal Guards</a> have a reputation, not helped at all by their depictions in pop culture, of being completely stoic and standing like statues, regardless of whatever is going on around or to them. In truth, however, they take their jobs as protectors of Buckingham Palace and the royal family <em>very seriously</em>: trying to pester them will result in them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyShouting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyShouting">Suddenly SHOUTING!</a> warnings to stop immediately, as well as drawing their rifles (which are loaded with live ammo).
