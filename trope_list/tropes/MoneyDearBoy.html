<div class="indent">— <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenceOlivier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenceOlivier">Laurence Olivier</a></strong>, on his role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Inchon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Inchon">Inchon</a></em> (full quote <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Quotes/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Quotes/MoneyDearBoy">here</a>)
</div></div><p>Sometimes, undeniably famous, classical actors and actresses (or even loveable, talented, squeaky-clean child and/or teen actors/actresses) take roles in movies that are very against their type. Unlike the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicallyTrainedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicallyTrainedExtra">Classically Trained Extras</a>, who lament that their talent is being wasted, or the small but legitimate roles of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSceneWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSceneWonder">One-Scene Wonder</a>, or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a> of roles taken when it was the only work available, this trope covers actors who are completely fine with the situation. Why? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Money, dear boy</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Obviously, movies are big business, and the right name at the top of the poster can be the difference between a hit and a flop. And it's hard to argue with the fact that, when offered buckets and buckets of cash for three weeks of shooting, anyone would be a fool not to take it. After all, acting is a volatile profession, as many starving artists can attest, and financial security for you and your family is nothing to turn from: It's not so much selling out, as selling <em>well</em>. And furthermore, most creative professions are overcrowded; for every wealthy and successful artist who can afford to sniff at jobs that are 'beneath' them, there are ten or more underworked ones who would kill for a chance at the income. On a cynical note, in the state that America is in today, you shouldn't be surprised to see this more often. Most actors have been seen sliding down the perceived hierarchy of the entertainment field, with the most common "step down" is for actors who primarily work in film suddenly "slumming it" by taking roles on television.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Still, if you do too many of these, you run the risk of having a rather strange <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDb">IMDb</a> record and irrevocably ruining your reputation as a creative thespian: so much potential and talent wasted. Some artists, however, can turn this to their advantage; a common reason cited by many successful artists who engage in this trope is that a high-paying job that doesn't greatly interest them means that they have more money to put into funding and appearing in lower-budget but more creatively appealing ones.
</p><p>To be clear, however, there is no shame at all for doing a movie for the money, and if the movie happens to be a great one, artistically or popularly, all the better. Even if it is for the money, the level can be kept high and professional and they can turn out something great (like the example with Coppola and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a></em>). And just because an actor or director only took a movie for money doesn't mean they'll necessarily dislike the end result.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>If it ends up a mediocre, run of the mill production, that's also excusable. People in creative jobs need an income the same as anyone else, and in fact, many of the greatest popcorn flicks of all time are great primarily because the studio shelled out the money to get actors and directors who would rather be doing something else, but who were still prepared to give the audience a good performance.
</p><p>However, should a cash-in movie end up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/SoBadItsHorrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/SoBadItsHorrible">So Bad, It's Horrible</a>, both the audience and the critics are likely to be notably less forgiving than they would be while judging a bad movie with original, artistic premise marred by flawed execution. As a result, rather paradoxically, an artist who takes the job for the money is perhaps best trying to put in a decent (or at least entertaining) performance even in a movie that doesn't match up to their standards. Whether they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookTheBadFilmSeriously" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookTheBadFilmSeriously">Took the Bad Film Seriously</a> or end up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewingTheScenery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewingTheScenery">Chewing the Scenery</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HamAndCheese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HamAndCheese">Ham and Cheese</a>, they're likely to elicit more respect from the audience than if they took the money but made it clear through their performance that they couldn't care less for anything but the paycheck.
</p><p>This is also the reason for the percentage of high-quality foreign artists appearing in crummy American films: Hollywood, even at its most cheapskate, tends to pay much better than any other film industry in the world. Note that this also applies to star in big US television shows; with multi-million dollar deals commonplace, it can allow you to be a lot more choosy for the next few years.
</p><p>Similar to getting a healthy paycheck, some actors will just want to do something "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoMyKidsCanWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoMyKidsCanWatch">their kids can watch</a>", the kind of roles most actors seek usually being dark and not appropriate for minors.
</p><p>A common theme — especially among older actors and actresses — stems from growing up during hard economic conditions, either from a poor economy as a whole or from family hardships. The fear that "The Next Job" may not come, as it often failed to do for their family, drives them to take roles they might not otherwise be interested in. And, again, they're not exaggerating: any actor, young and old, always deals with extremely uneven income flow with absolutely no hard guarantees for the future.
</p><p>There's also the common practice of recognizable actors turning up in indie films of varying quality "for scale". The term "for scale" means the minimum daily rate for actors guaranteed by the Screen Actors Guild, thus the opposite of this trope. When more notable actors do this, it's usually because they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt">wanted to establish themself in a dramatic role</a> (like the example with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DakotaFanning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DakotaFanning">Dakota Fanning</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hounddog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hounddog">Hounddog</a></em>, where her character infamously <em>got raped</em>). This doesn't stop them from becoming controversial among people, though. As a general rule, if a recognizable name turns up in a movie featured on MST3K or RiffTrax or has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GoldenRaspberryAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GoldenRaspberryAward">Golden Raspberry Award</a> listed in their "Accolades" section on Wikipedia, this trope is almost certainly why.
</p><p>Compare and contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt">Doing It for the Art</a> (when artistic value and/or achievement is the primary motivator), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeDearBoy">Awesome, Dear Boy</a> (when the actor takes the role for the coolness of it, regardless of how crappy the work is), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VacationDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VacationDearBoy">Vacation, Dear Boy</a> (where they work on the project so they can go to a special location), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneForTheMoneyOneForTheArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneForTheMoneyOneForTheArt">One for the Money; One for the Art</a> (where a creator uses the money earned from a purely commercial project to finance one that's more personal and artistic).
</p><p>See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualObligationProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualObligationProject">Contractual Obligation Project</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayingTheirDues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayingTheirDues">Paying Their Dues</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWasYoungAndNeededTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWasYoungAndNeededTheMoney">I Was Young and Needed the Money</a> (when this trope is given as the excuse for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a>), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WTHCastingAgency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WTHCastingAgency">WTH, Casting Agency?</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookTheBadFilmSeriously" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookTheBadFilmSeriously">Took the Bad Film Seriously</a>. Not to be confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney">Only in It for the Money</a>, which is when this is the excuse a character uses <em>in-story</em>.
</p><p>Also notice that if a great actor is in a crappy movie, it doesn't necessarily mean that he's in it just for the money; contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeDearBoy">Awesome, Dear Boy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoMyKidsCanWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoMyKidsCanWatch">So My Kids Can Watch</a>.

<ul><li> Bud Abbott only agreed to voice himself in the <em>Abbott and Costello</em> cartoon because he owed money to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntimidatingRevenueService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntimidatingRevenueService">the IRS</a>.
</li><li> Kareem Abdul-Jabbar appeared in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Airplane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Airplane">Airplane!</a></em> because the role paid for an expensive rug he wished to purchase. He even negotiated a raise for himself to cover the cost of the rug (they offered him $30,000; the rug cost $35,000). Subverted in that the movie is now considered a classic.
</li><li> Joss Ackland said that his money woes were the only reason he appeared in the movie <em>Passion of Mind</em>, which he called 'awful'.
</li><li> Arab-American comedian and actor Ahmed Ahmed has a <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/eA2-mxsMUtw">stand-up bit<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where he talks about getting offered the role of Terrorist #4 in a Hollywood movie (after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler">attempting to troll the audition</a> by playing the role as mockingly over-the-top as possible). Ahmed describes that his first reaction was to reject the role on principle because every time an ethnic actor takes a stereotypical role, it just perpetuates the problem... until his agent informed him that he would be paid $30,000 for a week of work, at which point he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryManHasHisPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryManHasHisPrice">promptly signed on.</a>
</li><li> In his book <em>There And Back Again: An Actor's Tale</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanAstin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanAstin">Sean Astin</a> talks at length about reconciling the conflict between the desire as an actor to do serious, important work, and the need to pay the bills by doing things like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EncinoMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EncinoMan">Encino Man</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnBarrowman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnBarrowman">John Barrowman</a> stated this as his only reason for appearing in the legendary <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SharkAttack3Megalodon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SharkAttack3Megalodon">Shark Attack 3: Megalodon</a></em>.
</li><li> One notable exception: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KimBasinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KimBasinger">Kim Basinger</a> backed out of the production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BoxingHelena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BoxingHelena">Boxing Helena</a></em>, and as a result was sued for eight million dollars. Basinger was forced to enter bankruptcy. Money well spent? Considering its critical/commercial failure and the catastrophic career damage that it caused to both director/writer Jennifer Chambers Lynch and eventual star Sherilyn Fenn, most would agree it was. <em>Rolling Stone</em>'s <a class="urllink" href="http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5947295/review/5947296/boxing_helena">review<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> even stated: "Sometimes even making the right decision can cost you."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HalleBerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HalleBerry">Halle Berry</a>:
<ul><li> This was her declared motivation for starring in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ExecutiveDecision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ExecutiveDecision">Executive Decision</a></em>. It evidently had nothing to do with the quality of the film itself (she simply didn't want to do it) but changed her mind when Warner Bros. offered her a $1 million salary for the role of a stewardess who helps the team. She quickly signed up for it.
</li><li> Berry received a $500,000 bonus on top of her base salary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Swordfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Swordfish">Swordfish</a></em> in exchange for agreeing to bare her breasts on-camera.
</li><li> She received a record salary for appearing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Catwoman2004" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Catwoman2004">Catwoman (2004)</a></em>, which flopped at the box office. She accepted the "Worst Actress" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GoldenRaspberryAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GoldenRaspberryAward">Razzie</a> with her Oscar (for <em>Monster's Ball</em>) in her other hand. This film has a strange history; before Berry was attached it was a generic superhero film. After getting her, it became a vanity film for Berry, and they shoehorned in the Catwoman angle. Perhaps Money, Dear Boy was at work when DC Comics allowed their trademarked name to be used in a film they had no input to. It really didn't help that the actual Catwoman character was off-limits because of the possibility she would appear in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises">another Batman movie</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulBettany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulBettany">Paul Bettany</a>'s growing family must be the reason he made <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Legion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Legion">Legion</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Priest2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Priest2011">Priest</a></em>. He even pulled out of the lead role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKingsSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKingsSpeech">The King's Speech</a></em> (which won <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColinFirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColinFirth">Colin Firth</a> an Oscar) to do the latter. Or perhaps for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeDearBoy">Awesome, Dear Boy</a>, as he has an entry there for <em>Legion</em> as well.

Specifically, the film was intended as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PilotMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PilotMovie">Pilot Movie</a> for a <em>Carrie</em> TV series (which ultimately didn't get picked up due to the film's disappointing ratings), and she took the role hoping it would lead to the sort of steady paycheck that working on a TV show provides.
</li><li> In a behind the scenes featurette for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FarCry3BloodDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FarCry3BloodDragon">Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBiehn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBiehn">Michael Biehn</a> stated that he did Rex Colt's voice work for a paycheck and not much else. However, much like the game itself, the featurette was very tongue-in-cheek, and Biehn also said he had quite a lot of fun recording the more...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb">colorful</a> lines of his character.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesBronson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesBronson">Charles Bronson</a>'s whole career. After an early life of extremely unpleasant and menial jobs, he took a stab at acting simply because he thought it looked like an easy way to make money. Even after he became the best-paid actor in the world, he described himself as "a product, like a cake of soap to be sold." In all of his interviews, he insisted that he had no opinions about the movies he appeared in or the roles he played. He simply memorized his lines and performed as needed.
</li><li> In Rock Brynner's book <em>Yul: The Man Who Would Be King</em>, this sentiment is expressed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YulBrynner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YulBrynner">Yul Brynner</a> to his son. Due to a combination of factors (including unscrupulous film studios, his absence from the U.S. and an increasing reliance on maintaining his property), Yul was content to take any role as long as it offered a paycheck. He turned in roles in scores of schlocky films, and would always note to his son that because the studios and government felt compelled to try to screw him over at every opportunity, he could do the same thing to make money on projects that were beneath his star power.
</li><li> In an interview promoting the film <em>28 Days</em> (no, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwentyEightDaysLater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwentyEightDaysLater">that one</a>), the interviewer asked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SandraBullock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SandraBullock">Sandra Bullock</a> why she chose to star in it.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCaine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCaine">Michael Caine</a>, who has stated: "First of all, I choose the great roles, and if none of these come, I choose the mediocre ones, and if they don't come, I choose the ones that pay the rent." His most shameful role is probably Hoagie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JawsTheRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JawsTheRevenge">Jaws: The Revenge</a></em> — his work on the film also prevented him from attending the ceremony where he would've been awarded his first Oscar. After his work on <em>Jaws IV</em>, Caine finally started turning down offers like this. At least until his appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bewitched" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bewitched">Bewitched</a></em>. Caine said of <em>Jaws IV</em>: "I have never seen it, but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house it built, and it is terrific."

On the stage, he played Hamlet. On the screen he played, well, damn near <em>anything</em>, with a filmography ranging from all-time classics to some of the worst movies ever made. He wasn't just in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie">B-movies</a>, he appeared in Z-movies like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedZoneCuba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedZoneCuba">Red Zone Cuba</a></em> and <em>Vampire Men of the Lost Planet.</em> And his son <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Carradine">David Carradine<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> definitely followed in his footsteps.

</li><li> It's also the reason he continues doing big-budget Hollywood movies, despite not really getting the "American humor" and accusations by the Chinese community that he's "selling out" by playing the funny Chinese man. The massive salary enables him to fund his Asian movies as well as continue his charitable work. He has said he prefers the indie Hong Kong dramas that he works on, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShinjukuIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShinjukuIncident">Shinjuku Incident</a></em>, which his Hollywood films help pay for.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoanCrawford" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoanCrawford">Joan Crawford</a>, for much of her life, was an in-demand actress who reigned at the box office. However, after she got fired from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HushHushSweetCharlotte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HushHushSweetCharlotte">Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte</a></em>, originally intended to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhateverHappenedToBabyJane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhateverHappenedToBabyJane">Whatever Happened To Baby Jane</a></em>, no one can deny that her film choices later in life were less motivated by the need for fame and more influenced by cold, hard cash (which was apparently caused by her star power fading and her being ousted from the board of Pepsi, formerly run by her deceased husband). This would explain why she went from dramatic leading roles to scenery-chewing in various cheap horror films produced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamCastle">William Castle</a> or Herman Cohen, as well as appearances in several short-lived television series — although she did also appear in the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllStarCast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllStarCast">guest-star laden</a> episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheManFromUNCLE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheManFromUNCLE">The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</a></em> ("The Five Daughters Affair").
<ul><li> <em>This Woman Is Dangerous</em> she only did because her house had a mortgage and her children were in school. She later disowned it.
</li><li> In the latter part of her career she starred in a string of B-horror movies because she needed the money, lamenting that they were a far cry from the days when she made thousands a week as an in-demand actress. As Neil Deagle of <em>Bad Movie Night</em> explained about <em>Trog</em> (her final film), "It's really sad to see such a huge star (like her) be consigned to the Z-grade abyss of films like this. But, hey, a girl's gotta eat."
</li><li> Though often cited as Crawford's lowest moment as an actor, <em>Trog</em> is in some ways an inversion: the director was a personal friend of hers and she did the movie more as a favor to him than in need of a paycheck. She was paid very well for the movie too, and a good portion of the budget was spent to ensure she had her own wardrobe van.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidCross">David Cross</a> has been very upfront about the fact that his participation in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlvinAndTheChipmunks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlvinAndTheChipmunks">Alvin and the Chipmunks</a></em> franchise has been motivated by money, noting his salary from the first film was more money than any of his other projects had ever brought in combined and helped him buy a new house. However, he seems to have had enough with the third film which he called "the most unpleasant experience I've ever had in my professional life," and he even asked people to not watch it in theaters on Conan.
</li><li> Averted until fairly recently by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillyCrudup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillyCrudup">Billy Crudup</a>, who only made the movies that he wanted to, because he made an astronomical amount of money by being the voice of the "For everything else, there's Mastercard," commercials.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamieLeeCurtis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamieLeeCurtis">Jamie Lee Curtis</a> had this to say about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenH20TwentyYearsLater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenH20TwentyYearsLater">Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later</a></em> in 2018: "H20 started out with best intentions, but it ended up being a money gig.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDance">Charles Dance</a> has done some films he's not proud of. In a quote taken from the <em>London Evening Standard</em> he said "I've done some appalling films. Junk is absolutely the right word. You do what you can with the stuff you're given. It's a misconception that actors make choices. For all but the most privileged few, the only choice is to work or not to work." He said of playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Sardo Numspa</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoldenChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoldenChild">The Golden Child</a></em>, "It put the old bank balance up a bit!"
</li><li> When asked why he did <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate">Stargate</a></em>, Jaye Davidson said, "I needed the money."
<ul><li> Originally, he had no intention of acting again after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCryingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCryingGame">The Crying Game</a></em>. So when he was offered a role in <em>Stargate</em>, he insisted on a $1 million salary, figuring there'd be no way they'd be willing to pay him that much. But his offer was accepted, and he decided that it'd be nice to have some financial security, so he took the role.
</li><li> Ditto for <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gateworld.net/movies/01.shtml">James Spader<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who found the script "awful". <em>"Acting, for me, is a passion, but it's also a job, and I've always approached it as such. I have a certain manual-labourist view of acting. There's no shame in taking a film because you need some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">fucking</a> money."</em>
</li></ul></li><li> This was originally the reason why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnDeLancie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnDeLancie">John de Lancie</a> took the role of Discord in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>. He had completely forgotten about the role, recorded months earlier, by the time the fan mail started pouring in. Upon interacting with the fanbase, he changed his mind somewhat, and not only expressed willingness to reprise his role, but also brought his own connections and resources to help make a documentary about the fans (though he was <em>not</em> happy when 4chan uploaded said film onto The Pirate Bay just to spite him, and the combination of that plus a horrible convention experience — where he and the other actors didn't get paid — led him to break off contact again).
</li><li> Julie Delpy stated that she only made <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnAmericanWerewolfInParis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnAmericanWerewolfInParis">An American Werewolf in Paris</a></em> because "I got paid a lot of money; let's face it, a girl's got to eat." Delpy admitted it was " just a campy, stupid little movie", but despite the experience being so miserable that she remained away from Hollywood, she says it's not an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a> because "it allowed me to spend time writing".

It's a safe bet that if he isn't starring in an indie film or one of his past franchise roles, he's probably doing it for the paycheck.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MorganFreeman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MorganFreeman">Morgan Freeman</a> said he only did <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins">Batman Begins</a></em> for the money.

</li><li> By most accounts, Gielgud thought little of film acting generally and mainly took roles for money, regardless of their quality.

</li><li> This is why it was said about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhoopiGoldberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhoopiGoldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a> that "nobody like a paycheck like her." On the other hand, she's one of only sixteen people to win the EGOT (an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony.)
<ul><li> Goldberg hadn't even been the first choice for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SisterAct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SisterAct">Sister Act</a></em> (which was conceived as a vehicle for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BetteMidler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BetteMidler">Bette Midler</a>) but the movie was such a huge hit that she was immediately approached to star in a sequel. She agreed in exchange for not only $7 million but also studio financing for a pet project of hers, a film adaptation of the stage musical <em>Sarafina!</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KimBasinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KimBasinger">Kim Basinger</a>'s situation after backing out of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BoxingHelena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BoxingHelena">Boxing Helena</a></em> was the main reason Goldberg settled for a massive paycheck on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheodoreRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheodoreRex">Theodore Rex</a></em>. She agreed to do it, saw the script, tried walking out, and decided "rich and ashamed" beat "broke and principled". She even negotiated a raise for herself, being paid $7 million (a hike from the $5 million she was originally promised), which must have looked nice against the $20 million lawsuit she would have faced had she dropped out.

<ul><li> Gossett himself pointed out that a "Best Supporting Actor" Oscar is something of a curse; smaller projects think they can't afford you, and larger projects don't think you can open a film on your own.

His contract was for 2% of Lucas' own 1/5 share of the film's gross earnings, which ended up (unexpectedly, to most observers) being among the most lucrative film deals ever made. This tempered his later opinion of the film; he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotSpock">deeply resented being identified with a film he vocally didn't respect</a>, but had to admit he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt">owed his later ability to be very picky with roles</a> to the resulting financial independence.

</li><li> Many of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneHackman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneHackman">Gene Hackman</a>'s roles were like this. A good example was the film <em>Lucky Lady</em>, which was a film that he didn't even want to do until Fox offered him $1.25 million (a lot of money in 1975) to make it. He decided that it would be obscene not to take the offer and accepted the part.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardHarris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardHarris">Richard Harris</a> took on a third-billed role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MutinyOnTheBounty1962" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MutinyOnTheBounty1962">Mutiny on the Bounty (1962)</a></em> for a hefty paycheck, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeDearBoy">a chance to act opposite Marlon Brando</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VacationDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VacationDearBoy">a free trip to Tahiti</a>.
<ul><li> He took on the title role in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cromwell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cromwell">Cromwell</a></em>, a casting choice that raised many eyebrows, as he was a hedonistic proudly patriotic Irishman playing a puritan who once committed genocide in Ireland. The salary was simply too good to pass up.
</li></ul></li><li> This is why <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Deadwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Deadwood">Deadwood</a></em> star John Hawkes played what was essentially a bit part in season six of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> — his role was literally just repeating what another actor said and for that, he got paid a lot and filmed in Hawaii.
</li><li> As an actor, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LanceHenriksen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LanceHenriksen">Lance Henriksen</a> has appeared in well over 100 films. Many of these have been great (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens">Aliens</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator">The Terminator</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CloseEncountersOfTheThirdKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CloseEncountersOfTheThirdKind">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NearDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NearDark">Near Dark</a></em>). Many more, however, have been pretty dire (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiranhaPartTwoTheSpawning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiranhaPartTwoTheSpawning">Piranha Part Two: The Spawning</a></em>, <em>Vampires: Out For Blood</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HellraiserHellworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HellraiserHellworld">Hellraiser: Hellworld</a></em> to name but a few). He even worked in a Brazilian soap opera about mutants. Henriksen is a king of direct-to-DVD and seems to specialize in mostly low budget SF, horror, fantasy, or action flicks — films in which he is very often the only notable actor on board. Henriksen is also often very guilty of phoning-it-in, and frequently plays the same deadpan, imposing, monotone father-figure character he's been portraying for the last thirty-or-so years. He's appeared in multiple cheap cash-ins on pre-existing popular franchises (see <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMockbuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMockbuster">The Da Vinci Treasure</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMockbuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMockbuster">Pirates Of Treasure Island</a></em>, both released in 2006) has provided voice duties for many animated series and video games, appeared in adverts and also found time along the way to star in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisCarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisCarter">Chris Carter</a>'s grim (but mostly great) pseudo-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">X-Files</a></em> spinoff series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Millennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Millennium">Millennium</a></em> for three years. Henriksen has admitted to taking some less-than-stellar roles for the money because he owed alimony to his ex-wife. He's undeniably one of those actors and when he is good, such as in <em>Millennium</em>, he is <em>very</em> good.
</li><li> German film director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WernerHerzog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WernerHerzog">Werner Herzog</a> took the role of The Client in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMandalorian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMandalorian">The Mandalorian</a></em> solely to finance his next film project, admitting that he had never seen any Star Wars property beyond a trailer or two. However, he has stated he enjoyed the role and series, being very effusive with his praise for all involved.
</li><li> Eamonn Holmes explained his appearance on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mongrels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mongrels">Mongrels</a></em> by saying he didn't even look at the script, only the fee.

</li><li> Practically any film that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarxBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarxBrothers">Marx Brothers</a> accepted to make together after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ADayAtTheRaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ADayAtTheRaces">A Day at the Races</a></em> was made to raise money to cover for Chico Marx's recurring debts and expenses. This is especially true of their final film, <em>Love Happy</em>, which was not originally planned to include Groucho and Chico.
</li><li> When Hattie McDaniel, who won an Academy Award for playing a house slave in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneWithTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneWithTheWind">Gone with the Wind</a></em>, was asked why she kept taking roles that cast her as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mammy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mammy">a stereotypical black servant</a> in films and radio shows, she famously responded, "Why should I complain about making $700<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1hj13');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1hj13" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1hj13');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">$12,000 by today's standards</span> a week playing a maid?

He seemed to quite enjoy his higher profile and remarked on how funny it was he and his cohorts from his stage days were known for these sorts of roles. Of course, he's also done things like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDaVinciCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDaVinciCode">The Da Vinci Code</a></em> in between things like appearing with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatrickStewart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatrickStewart">Patrick Stewart</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/WaitingForGodot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/WaitingForGodot">Waiting for Godot</a></em> on stage.

The producers kept coming back to him, so to deter them, he asked for (at the time) an exorbitant amount of money, more than an actor had ever been paid for British TV up to that time. To his great surprise, the producers accepted his asking price, and the rest is history.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayMilland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayMilland">Ray Milland</a> had an illustrious film career when he was younger, winning a Best Actor award for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLostWeekend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLostWeekend">The Lost Weekend</a></em> in 1945 and appearing in a clutch of other classics like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheUninvited1944" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheUninvited1944">The Uninvited</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DialMForMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DialMForMurder">Dial M for Murder</a></em>.

When asked why, he answered, "For the money, old boy!"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HelenMirren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HelenMirren">Helen Mirren</a> was once asked why she appeared in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeachingMrsTingle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeachingMrsTingle">Teaching Mrs. Tingle</a></em>. The answer? "Because they gave me a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">shitload</a> of money to do it."
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulianneMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulianneMoore">Julianne Moore</a>, the only reason why she agreed to do <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLostWorldJurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLostWorldJurassicPark">The Lost World: Jurassic Park</a></em> — she thought the script was juvenile and has had a long-term mutual hatred for her co-star <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeffGoldblum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeffGoldblum">Jeff Goldblum</a>, apparently — was because she needed to pay off a divorce settlement and her paycheck came at just the right time.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieMurphy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieMurphy">Eddie Murphy</a> agreed to appear as a "Strategic Guest Star" in the very-forgettable film <em>Best Defense</em>. When he hosted <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em> soon after, he slammed it as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">the worst film in the history of everything</a>" and justified his role by saying "If you were paid to do <em>Best Defense</em> as much as they paid me to do <em>Best Defense</em>, you'd do <em>Best Defense</em> too!". (Though there was also some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeDearBoy">Awesome, Dear Boy</a> involved — he wanted to work with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DudleyMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DudleyMoore">Dudley Moore</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2fo14');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2fo14" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2fo14');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The film was shot as a solo Moore vehicle but retooled to include Murphy in scenes that were set two years later but relied on the events in Moore's plot thread. Originally the characters met in an epilogue that was shot but cut from the finished film.</span>) In one interview, he admitted that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAdventuresOfPlutoNash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAdventuresOfPlutoNash">The Adventures of Pluto Nash</a></em> wasn't very good, but went on to say that it was hard to really regret it when "your pocket goes out to here" while holding his palm several inches away from his pocket. Let's not forget that an interviewer asked Murphy whether he'd have preferred to have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward">Academy Award</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Dreamgirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Dreamgirls">Dreamgirls</a></em> or his paycheck from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Norbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Norbit">Norbit</a></em>. He replied that while an Oscar statuette would look nice in his living room, it wouldn't pay the bills.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikeMyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikeMyers">Mike Myers</a> backed out of a film based upon Dieter, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em> character, and was sued by Universal Pictures for $3.8 million. His decision to back out of the $20 million contract was an inversion of this trope; he was unhappy with the script (despite having written it himself) and didn't feel the film would be of a standard acceptable for moviegoers — as a compromise for the studio, he accepted to do <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCatInTheHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCatInTheHat">The Cat in the Hat</a></em>.

</li><li> Why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LiamNeeson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LiamNeeson">Liam Neeson</a> agreed to do more <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Taken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Taken">Taken</a></em> films after the first. He was paid $15 million for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Taken2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Taken2">Taken 2</a></em>, and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1709538/liam-neeson-taken-3/">$20 million for<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Taken3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Taken3">Taken 3</a></em>.
</li><li> This appears to be why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeslieNielsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeslieNielsen">Leslie Nielsen</a> starred in a lot of critically-panned films later in his life.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackNicholson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackNicholson">Jack Nicholson</a>'s $60 million deal for the 1989 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989">Batman</a></em> movie included a $6 million base salary, top billing, and both a percentage of the gross and merchandising. It remains the single-largest film salary record. Around the time the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoelSchumacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoelSchumacher">Joel Schumacher</a> movies were hitting theatres and there were projects for a follow-up if <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanAndRobin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanAndRobin">Batman &amp; Robin</a></em> wasn't so bad, Nicholson said he would consider reprising the role of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> for $150 million. Which makes sense. After seeing Schumacher's Batman movies, wouldn't <em>you</em> ask an exorbitant wage to shame yourself on his next movie? Apparently, when Danny DeVito was in negotiations to appear as the Penguin in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns">Batman Returns</a></em>, he called Nicholson to ask his advice on the character and the contract. Jack's response? "Try to get my deal". Then again Jack Nicholson did go on record for saying he enjoyed playing the Joker and was a big supporter of then-rookie director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton">Tim Burton</a> during filming. So while the money got him to do it, he didn't hate or feel indifferent toward role like most others on the list. He reportedly liked the role so much that he had wanted to reprise the part in the ill-fated <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a></em> live-action movie that WB had considered making. He was also upset when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HeathLedger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HeathLedger">Heath Ledger</a> took over the part in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em>.
</li><li> Speaking of Jack Nicholson: While making <em>The St. Valentine's Day Massacre</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerCorman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerCorman">Roger Corman</a> offered him a secondary but significant role. Looking at the shooting schedule, however, Jack noticed a small bit part — two scenes and one line of dialog — which due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug">Good Bad Bug</a> in the Screen Actors Guild regulations would get him paid for five weeks of work. He took the small role and the big paycheck instead.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NickNolte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NickNolte">Nick Nolte</a> has said that he sold his soul by agreeing to make <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ILoveTrouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ILoveTrouble">I Love Trouble</a></em> strictly for the money and that it's his worst film, which explains how his attitude on set was so bad that his costar, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuliaRoberts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuliaRoberts">Julia Roberts</a>, still says he's the worst actor she's ever worked with.
</li><li> Comedian Jim Norton pretty much says he only does movies for the money.
</li><li> Carroll O'Connor pulled off a massive version of this during the sixth season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllInTheFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllInTheFamily">All in the Family</a></em>. During the hiatus between seasons, O'Connor lobbied for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a> to greatly increase his salary, as well as give him more creative control. Studio executives balked at his demands, and production of the season started without him (which led to a three-episode arc where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenInAbsence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenInAbsence">Archie goes missing on the way to a convention</a>). CBS head Fred Silverman successfully convinced O'Connor to come back at a much higher salary. By the time <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArchieBunkersPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArchieBunkersPlace">Archie Bunker's Place</a></em> began, O'Connor was the highest-paid cast member (and, by the end of the first season, the <em>only</em> original cast member) and an executive producer, and rode the salary bump through four more seasons of diminishing ratings.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GaryOldman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GaryOldman">Gary Oldman</a> is known for driving a particularly hard bargain. He won't even <em>read</em> most scripts without a hefty offer on the table, and he's known for having almost bowed out of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> franchise over salary disputes. Sadly, the makers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/QuestForCamelot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/QuestForCamelot">Quest for Camelot</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LostInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LostInSpace">Lost in Space</a></em> must have been aware of this bargain prior to hiring him. He also decided against credit when he wasn't allowed top billing alongside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnthonyHopkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnthonyHopkins">Anthony Hopkins</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hannibal">Hannibal</a></em>. Further, if you are not a union production, <em>no</em> amount of money will get you his services, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas">George Lucas</a> found out when he offered Oldman the role of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">General Grevious</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a> Episode III: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note35wzk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note35wzk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note35wzk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Lucas left the Director's Guild in the '80s after the Guild tried to force him to have credits at the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em>, and so many in Hollywood who are pro-SAG and DGA consider it the equivalent of being a scab worker.</span>
<ul><li> Oldman reportedly only took the role of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SidVicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SidVicious">Sid Vicious</a> in Alex Cox's <em>Sid &amp; Nancy</em> because it would pay well, having no particular fondness for the material or for punk music. That's not to say he didn't give it his all — he lost frightening amounts of weight to match Vicious' heroin-addict figure and reportedly stayed in character some nights after shooting while going clubbing with the cinematographer. That, and he gave the best and most faithful performance of anyone in the film.
</li><li> Of course, the main reason he signed onto <em>Potter</em> in the first place was that he hadn't done a film in over a year and desperately needed the money.

According to him, it was "the most irresponsible bit of filmmaking — if you can even call it that — that I've ever seen" and he also called the film a "disaster".

<ul><li> As he says in his stand-up act: "If you were offered $100,000 to kill a dying show, you're a fucking idiot if you turn it down!"

Stewart's knowingly hammy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewingTheScenery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewingTheScenery">scene-chewing</a> is all part of the fun — he's clearly having a blast with it.

To be fair, most of what Stewart does is because he just loves acting in general and has the habit of doing whatever he likes at the time, being serious drama to cornball comedy and everything in between. It's been said that he never takes on a role unless he <em>wants</em> to. Even before he was in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>, Stewart took a role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Lifeforce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Lifeforce">Lifeforce</a></em> (the naked space vampire movie) to pay for the replacement of a broken bay window at his house. He also took on a role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WildGeeseII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WildGeeseII">Wild Geese II</a></em> because he just had an expensive maintenance job done in his kitchen.
<ul><li> By the way, Stewart once recollected about accepting an award in Britain. While with other British stage actors, he said he was asked the same thing repeatedly about his Hollywood experiences — "How much do you get paid?"
</li></ul></li><li> Ryan Stiles admitted in an interview that, despite having a fear of flying, he was willing to fly to the UK to do <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhoseLineIsItAnyway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhoseLineIsItAnyway">Whose Line Is It Anyway?</a></em> because at the time he desperately needed the money.

He was so sure the film would flop that he took a straightforward salary over a percentage of the profits. This turned out to be a very poor decision.
<ul><li> He also admitted in an interview in the '80s that he took a role in the forgotten 1981 Canadian comedy "Gas" because he was broke and needed the money.
</li></ul></li><li> The Japanese actor Tetsuro Tamba was legendary for never turning down a paying role, no matter what it was in (he also never read the entire script for a movie, or memorized a script). He also founded a religion. Cool guy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlizeTheron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlizeTheron">Charlize Theron</a> admitted in an interview that she starred in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hancock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hancock">Hancock</a></em> for the money.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexTrebek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexTrebek">Alex Trebek</a> signed onto host the short-lived 1981 game show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Pitfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Pitfall">Pitfall</a></em> after going through a bitter divorce coupled with the passing of his father. Despite leaping over several legal hurdles in his native Canada to get the job, the second of his two paychecks bounced due to parent company Catalena Productions going bankrupt mid-production. All was not lost as he went onto host <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Battlestars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Battlestars">Battlestars</a></em> for NBC later that same year.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarisaTomei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarisaTomei">Marisa Tomei</a> has pretty much admitted herself that she enjoys money:

He is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSceneWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSceneWonder">the best thing in each of these films</a>. He also subverts this trope. He's said repeatedly in interviews that he takes any role offered to him as long as he has the time because he regards every film he works on as a learning experience.

After <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens">Aliens</a></em>, Weaver had intended it to be the last role she would play as the character...until 20th Century Fox lured her back to the third film (after rejecting several scripts by other writers that didn't include her) with a much bigger payday and a producer's credit. Years later, during an interview, she responded to the question, "Why did you agree to do <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienResurrection">Alien: Resurrection</a></em>?" by saying, "Because they drove a dump truck full of money to my house."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonWelles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonWelles">Orson Welles</a> willingly accepted an endless chain of well-paying bit parts in many films.
<ul><li> He hawked <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/V14PfDDwxlE">frozen peas<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/bpj0t2ozPWY">Paul Masson wine<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. His work on these commercials has been the subject of parody, most notably on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCritic">The Critic</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></em>. That said, Welles enjoyed making most of these commercials, considering them a fun and easy way to make a buck; the "Frozen Peas" recording was an outlier prompted by an obnoxious director.
</li><li> One of Welles' last roles was voicing the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersTheMovie">Transformers: The Movie</a></em> villain Unicron. While both the character and the performance are unforgettable, Welles himself viewed the production with contempt and could only recall it was a movie about "toys killing each other."
</li><li> He did the narration on the remastered version of <em>Tales of Mystery and Imagination — Edgar Allan Poe</em> by the Alan Parsons Project. It was straight wage work: the whole thing was arranged through agents, Welles was sent a script, and Parsons was sent a tape.
</li><li> He also narrated the frightfully awful, fundamentalist Christian dreck-fest, <em>The Late, Great Planet Earth</em>, with Hal Lindsey, and the cheesy, sensationalistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nostradamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nostradamus">Nostradamus</a> "documentary" <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWhoSawTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWhoSawTomorrow">The Man Who Saw Tomorrow</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenWhishaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenWhishaw">Ben Whishaw</a>'s quotes about replacing Colin Firth as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Paddington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Paddington">Paddington</a></em> in <em>The Daily Mail</em> saying that he has "no relationship to Paddington whatsoever" and attended the audition "begrudgingly" probably points to this trope as a reason why he signed on. Subverted to an extent, as that same interview revealed Whishaw's attitude turned into a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoMyKidsCanWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoMyKidsCanWatch">So My Kids Can Watch</a> since he has an 18-month-old niece, and his initial apprehension was due to previous bad experiences doing voice-over work. Once he started working he quite enjoyed himself.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams">Robin Williams</a> said he sometimes did movies only to pay the bills.

He also admitted the reason he did <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCrazyOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCrazyOnes">The Crazy Ones</a></em> was that he had "bills to pay".
<ul><li> Subverted with regards to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityVoiceActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityVoiceActor">his voicing the Genie</a> in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin">Aladdin</a></em> film, where he agreed to be paid at SAG scale and requested that Disney not utilize his character or performance excessively in the marketing. Disney naturally ignored the second request, which led to Williams refusing to return to the role in the first direct-to-video sequel (and the subsequent series) and only reprised it for the second sequel for $1 million, playing this trope straight. (Weirdly he then reprised the Genie one more time for a bunch of interstitial segments on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OneSaturdayMorning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OneSaturdayMorning">One Saturday Morning</a> called "Great Minds Think For Themselves", as well as in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisneysMathQuestWithAladdin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisneysMathQuestWithAladdin">Disney's Math Quest with Aladdin</a>; the motives for him doing so were never revealed.)

These include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenStiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenStiller">Ben Stiller</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicolasCage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicolasCage">Nicolas Cage</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlizeTheron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlizeTheron">Charlize Theron</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KieferSutherland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KieferSutherland">Kiefer Sutherland</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanConnery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanConnery">Sean Connery</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterStallone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterStallone">Sylvester Stallone</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceWillis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceWillis">Bruce Willis</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradPitt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradPitt">Brad Pitt</a> and many, <em>many</em> others.

</li><li> In his autobiography, <em>If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B-Movie Actor</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceCampbell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceCampbell">Bruce Campbell</a> explains this reasoning in response to fan criticism of his appearances in stinkers like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Congo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Congo">Congo</a></em>. He reiterates that actors need to pay the bills like everyone else, and notes other side-benefits of being tied to a production. In the case of <em>Congo</em>, he was flown to Costa Rica, and his scenes did not involve the rest of the main cast so he was only needed on set one day a week. The rest of the time he toured Costa Rica on the studio's dime, "which I would have done myself anyway!". As his <em>Congo</em> co-star Ernie Hudson once said: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters1984">If there's a steady paycheck in it, I'll believe anything you say.</a>"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a> was once quoted as saying, "If [an actor] asks me, 'What's my motivation?', I reply, '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Your salary</a>.'"
</li><li> An entry in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a>'s "Little Movie Glossary" describes the effect of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarlonBrando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarlonBrando">Marlon Brando</a>'s participation in a film as the "Brando Acceptability Yardstick" — as the whole idea of respected actors doing comic book movies for the money can be traced to him. See the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Superman">Superman</a></em> franchise, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ApocalypseNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ApocalypseNow">Apocalypse Now</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIslandOfDrMoreau1996" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIslandOfDrMoreau1996">The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996)</a></em>. Incidentally, Brando received, as a salary for the entirety of his work on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a></em>, approximately 1% of his <em>Superman: The Movie</em> salary, which was once calculated by The Guinness Book of Records as <strong>eight dollars for every second he was on screen</strong>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidThewlis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidThewlis">David Thewlis</a> said a huge paycheck, plus going to Australia and working with Brando, was a motivation for <em>Dr. Moreau</em>. Given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a>, he later regretted it. Thewlis skipped the film's premiere and has vowed to never watch it.

According to Leary, the three of them had pictures of real estate they wanted to buy to get them through the shoot.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenAffleck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenAffleck">Ben Affleck</a> once hawked <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Paycheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Paycheck">Paycheck</a></em> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConanOBrien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConanOBrien">Conan O'Brien</a>. Conan asked him why he did the film, and Ben fittingly told him "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">the answer lies in the title</a>." Affleck appeared on a British chatshow to publicize the movie, only to be told by the enthusiastic host that it was one of the best science fiction films he had ever seen — the host actually suggested that <em>Paycheck</em> was at least as good as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner">Blade Runner</a></em>, and asked Affleck if he agreed. You could see how bemused Affleck was as he admitted that he thought Blade Runner was the better movie. Co-star <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulGiamatti" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulGiamatti">Paul Giamatti</a> referred to the film as "the aptly-named <em>Paycheck</em>" in an appearance on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDailyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDailyShow">The Daily Show</a></em>.
</li><li> Both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MillaJovovich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MillaJovovich">Milla Jovovich</a> and director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulWSAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulWSAnderson">Paul W.S.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Superman">Superman</a></em> franchise has been the focus of a number of publicized instances involving the stars:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarlonBrando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarlonBrando">Marlon Brando</a> was ultimately paid $14 million for 10 minutes as Jor-El.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneHackman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneHackman">Gene Hackman</a>, as Lex Luthor, also apparently swung a nice deal. Hackman admitted in interviews that his appearance in <em>The Quest for Peace</em> was entirely financially motivated. Admittedly, it couldn't be much else.
</li></ul></li><li> The "Curly Joe" era of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges">The Three Stooges</a> was mostly this. However, it's easy to justify because the Stooges got royally screwed over on the shorts that made them famous.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersTheMovie">Transformers: The Movie</a></em>: Featuring the voice talents of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonWelles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonWelles">Orson Welles</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardNimoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardNimoy">Leonard Nimoy</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EricIdle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EricIdle">Eric Idle</a>, among others, in what can best be described as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">80-minute toy commercial</a>. They were <em>all</em> in it for the money.
<ul><li> Welles told his biographer about the film, "I play a big toy who does horrible things to a bunch of smaller toys."
</li><li> Idle admitted in his book <em>The Greedy Bastard Diary</em> that he had hated every minute of production. "Why did I do it, again? Oh, right, they offered me oodles of cash." <a class="urllink" href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/eric-idle,13802">He's also said<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that he never even watched the movie, and makes a habit out of it with such roles.
</li><li> It is rumored that Leonard Nimoy was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">so embarrassed about it that he refused to address it for years afterward, whether in interviews or at science-fiction conventions</a>. Only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay">Michael Bay</a>'s interest in casting him as The Fallen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersRevengeOfTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersRevengeOfTheFallen">Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</a></em> prompted him to talk about his role, and then only briefly (and he also said that Bay could call him up if he wanted to, but Bay ultimately went with Tony Todd). Bay finally called up Nimoy to cast him as Sentinel Prime in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersDarkOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersDarkOfTheMoon">Transformers: Dark of the Moon</a></em>.
</li><li> That said, this negativity wasn't true of all the celebrities in the movie; Robert Stack and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuddNelson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuddNelson">Judd Nelson</a> were in it to get paid and embraced their roles; Robert Stack (according to some production staff) liked the movie and Judd Nelson reprised his role for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> 20 years later.
</li><li> On the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> film, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HugoWeaving" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HugoWeaving">Hugo Weaving</a> has <a class="urllink" href="http://collider.com/hugo-weaving-the-hobbit-trilogy-interview/203015/">casually admitted<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to phoning in his performance as Megatron. He seems guilty about it.
<div class="indent"> I just went in and did it. I never read the script. I just have my lines, and I don't know what they mean. That sounds absolutely pathetic! I've never done anything like that, in my life.
</div></li><li> Michael Bay <a class="urllink" href="http://www.themarysue.com/michael-bay-hugo-weaving/">got passive-aggressive<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> about this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> Both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertPattinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertPattinson">Robert Pattinson</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristenStewart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristenStewart">Kristen Stewart</a> have said that they only did the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> movie for the money, and both of them have inserted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take Thats</a> against the book and its fans in interviews. Also, Pattinson said that he wanted to do <em>Twilight</em> in order to have the opportunity to work with Stewart, who, prior to <em>Twilight</em>, was known as a serious actress who did mostly independent films (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg">and</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zathura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zathura">Zathura</a></em>). Also, it's <em>Kristen Stewart</em>. He was reportedly hitting on her throughout filming. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamieCampbellBower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamieCampbellBower">Jamie Campbell Bower</a>, who is playing Caius, also seems to have only signed on for the money as all he knew about <em>Twilight</em> prior to then was that the first movie had done well. And Pattinson has gone on record as saying he thinks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenieMeyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenieMeyer">Stephenie Meyer</a> is literally insane. Both lead actors have also been publicly caught in scandals, in what many anti-fans jokingly claim are attempts to get released from their contract... a hypothesis that was then backed up by Stewart in an interview.
<ul><li> It is pretty telling to note that Pattinson and Stewart collectively drove a particularly hard bargain going into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Twilight">New Moon</a></em> and negotiated a six-fold salary increase for themselves (in other words, these two people alone cost the filmmakers 40% of their budget).
</li><li> David Slade, who publicly blasted the <em>Twilight</em> franchise prior to signing on to do <em>Eclipse</em>, had to apologize for his comments later on. Given the budget for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HardCandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HardCandy">Hard Candy</a></em>, he can be forgiven for invoking this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> This has to explain <em>Warrior of the Lost World</em>, which in addition to featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldPleasence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldPleasence">Donald Pleasence</a>, also provided an income for Robert Ginty, Persis Khambatta (pretty much only known for her role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture">Star Trek: The Motion Picture</a></em>), and Fred Williamson.
</li><li> Scott Mendelson from <em>Forbes</em> has <a class="urllink" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2015/04/30/so-laura-linney-has-joined-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-2/">noted<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that it has become common knowledge that any serious actor looking for real money acting in Hollywood outside of joining a TV series is to establish a character in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero">superhero</a> or fantasy film franchise as soon as you can.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBluesBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBluesBrothers">The Blues Brothers</a></em>: Want to know how the movie was filled to the brim with blues and soul royalty? <em>The artists needed the money.</em> We may think of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArethaFranklin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArethaFranklin">Aretha Franklin</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RayCharles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RayCharles">Ray Charles</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JamesBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JamesBrown">James Brown</a> as legends today, but they and their peers saw their careers decline in the 1970s as disco became the dominant urban music genre. Many of them had a resurgence in popularity in the '80s due in no small part to the film's success.
</li><li> Zigzagged for Mike Stoklasa and Jay Bauman of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/RedLetterMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/RedLetterMedia">RedLetterMedia</a>, who state in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary">DVD Commentary</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRecovered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRecovered">The Recovered</a></em> that making the film was like recording a wedding video because it was <em>not</em> a passion project. They just wanted to make a low-budget horror film that they could easily shoot and sell for a profit. However, they ultimately couldn't help inserting things that interested them rather than what mainstream audiences would want to buy. As a result, their "just for the money" film turned out extremely unmarketable.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarRiceBurroughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarRiceBurroughs">Edgar Rice Burroughs</a> only started writing in his thirties during a period of low employment. He had been reading pulp magazines and thought that he could write at least as well as this garbage and get paid for it, despite never having written anything before. After his stories became successful he made all the money he could, in particular marketing Tarzan, his most successful character, in every way possible.

The huge sums of money editors were offering him for new Holmes stories, and his dwindling bank account, no doubt played a part in his decision to finally take the plunge. There is an anecdote sometimes cited that says that, tired of being asked to revive Holmes, he finally asked for a ridiculously huge sum of money that he knew the publishers wouldn't be able to pay, and was appropriately shocked when they immediately said yes. Doyle was paid around 600 Pounds per Holmes story, worth about 80,000 Pounds (or $125,000) today
</li><li> After his wife gave birth to their fifth child, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens">Charles Dickens</a> needed some cash to cover the doctor's bills. Six weeks later he had written and sold <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol">A Christmas Carol</a></em>. Something of an aversion in that, even though it was almost immediately a critical hit and is regarded as a classic today, it ultimately didn't make Dickens as much money as he hoped it would — he had to pay for the publication of it himself because his usual publishers refused, but what set him back was his insistence of hand-colored illustrations and page decorations, which ate into his share of the profits.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreatExpectations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreatExpectations">Great Expectations</a></em> was only written because Dickens's magazine 'All The Year Round' was doing poorly and the only thing that would revive it was a serialized Dickens novel.
</li><li> Dickens, like many other authors at the time, was also paid per installment leading to some of his longer works like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BleakHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BleakHouse">Bleak House</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleDorrit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleDorrit">Little Dorrit</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OurMutualFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OurMutualFriend">Our Mutual Friend</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> As noted before, this trope doesn't necessarily result in bad fiction — think of the doorstopping evergreens by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FyodorDostoevsky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FyodorDostoevsky">Fyodor Dostoevsky</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexandreDumas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexandreDumas">Alexandre Dumas</a>. Both were paid per line.

This is thought to be one of the reasons for the novel's unique flow of thoughts making it both an inspiration to psychoanalysis and Joyce's stream of consciousness.
</li><li> It has been claimed by several close associates and friends that one of the biggest reasons Ian Fleming created <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> was that he needed a way to look after his brand new wife and baby whilst maintaining his luxurious and exotic jet-set party lifestyle, his holiday home in Jamaica (that was a money-sink for ten months of the year) and his many (eventually fatal) vices such as his seventy a day smoking habit and borderline alcoholic drink intake.

</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertBParker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertBParker">Robert B. Parker</a>'s primary motivation for writing was so he could provide his family with a comfortable life without needing to work a 9-to-5 job. His characters live on in books by other authors so his family can continue receiving royalties.

Sure enough, he stays. When asked later why the author was willing to risk him walking, she replies with this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>, in an interview with Stephen Briggs in the third edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">The Discworld Companion</a></em>, on not having won many literary awards and the hint that the Booker prize may be opened up to more popular works: "A 'popular' book means the author has already got what a true writer craves: a lot of readers and a big cheque". He once said of being beaten out for a Hugo award "On the other hand, going home and falling backward into a big pile of money always helps." Of course, Sir Terry's (Kt, OBE, Ph.D. (x8, all honorary)) lack of literary awards was likely due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiGhetto">Sci Fi Ghetto</a> more than any lack of talent on his part.
<ul><li> When asked if he was jealous of the money that Douglas Adams made, he replied: "Not at all, especially since it's been tactfully pointed out that I had to change banks after filling the last one up."
</li><li> In fact, in one of his books, he claims that the dream of every publisher is "to have so much gold in one's pockets that you have to hire two people to hold your pants up."
</li></ul></li><li> The "penny dreadful" pulp authors of the 1930s, when magazines paid $0.01 a word.
<ul><li> Of course, "penny dreadfuls" have been around for much longer than that. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BenjaminDisraeli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BenjaminDisraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a> wrote a bunch of cheap <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceNovel">Romance Novels</a> for the sole and explicit purpose of funding his political career (politics didn't pay nearly as well back then as it does now).
</li></ul></li><li> Mario Puzo was a struggling novelist who published two autobiographical novels, <em>The Dark Arena</em> and <em>The Fortunate Pilgrim</em>, that sold poorly. Deeply in debt and unable to break out of poorly-paid freelance jobs, Puzo turned to a publisher friend for help. The publisher suggested he write about organized crime, a subject Puzo was neither especially interested in nor knowledgable about. Three years of research and writing later, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a></em> resulted.
</li><li> The ultimate example may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>. The plays were probably written for the quick profit and the poetry to increase the author's social standing in the Elizabethan court. Not surprisingly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet">Hamlet</a></em> seems to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt">the major exception.</a>
</li><li> Edward Stratemeyer, he of the Stratemeyer Syndicate, could be seen in modern times as being a little chauvinistic (of course, remember, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">this was the 1920s,</a> feminism was only just beginning to come into focus.) So why did he end up creating and outlining <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NancyDrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NancyDrew">Nancy Drew</a></em>, who has been seen as a feminist role model by many? Because when he saw how many girls were reading <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHardyBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHardyBoys">The Hardy Boys</a></em> books, a little voice in his head said, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FieldOfDreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FieldOfDreams">"If you write them, they will buy."</a> This was also true of most of the many ghostwriters, who got paid fairly well for the books (roughly one month's work could net six weeks pay.) Although there were at least two aversions to this, though. Two of the most prominent ghostwriters, Mildred Wirt Benson for Nancy and Leslie McFarlane for the Hardys, actually did put quite a bit of effort into their characters (at least initially, McFarlane grew tired of the stories later.)
</li><li> Arguably the entire point of the Spackman Initiative in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePaleKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePaleKing">The Pale King</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidFosterWallace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidFosterWallace">David Foster Wallace</a>.

</li><li> While it wasn't his motivation for starting the novel, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain">Mark Twain</a> had left <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinn">Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</a></em> unfinished because he was unsatisfied with the work and didn't wish to write anymore. He only finished the novel when it reached the point where he desperately needed the money, and there are points where it shows. <em>Tom Sawyer Abroad</em> and <em>Tom Sawyer, Detective</em> are even straighter examples because they owe their very existence to the very same situation.
</li><li> Tony Schwartz ghostwrote <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">The Art of the Deal</a></em> at a time when he was facing a high mortgage as his family was growing.

As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CatherineTate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CatherineTate">Catherine Tate</a> put it:
<div class="indent"><em>"When they asked me to do the show. I thought; well I don't know anything about music. But on the other hand, that kitchen extension is not going to pay for itself."</em>
</div></li><li> Then-well-known stage actors James Daly and Louise Sorel, who guest-starred together in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS3E19RequiemForMethuselah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS3E19RequiemForMethuselah">Requiem for Methuselah</a>" as Flint and Reyna, respectively. Both thought the series was childish and cartoony and later both admitted the only reason they did the episode was the paycheck.
<div class="indent"><strong>Louise Sorel:</strong> (about the episode) "They put me in this funny costume  I stood still and they just wrapped fabric around me  and I had an Annette Funicello bouffant and Dusty Springfield eye make-up. James Daly and I thought of ourselves as these two very serious theater actors. He kept looking at me and asking, "Why on Earth are we doing this?" I kept telling him, 'Christmas money.'"
</div></li><li> On a somewhat more local level, <em>Totally Hidden Video</em> once did an episode in which several different kinds of professional musicians were hired to play for a wedding with it only being revealed to them once they arrived that the newlyweds were... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CandidCameraPrank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CandidCameraPrank">a pair of dogs</a>. Since they were, after all, being paid their going rate to perform for the happy couple, the most reaction the camera was able to get out of any of them was a rather long and curious stare before they set up their instruments and went to work. To keep the audience amused, therefore, the show also milked some comedy out of the <em>dogs' reaction</em> to the musicians. (They didn't like the mariachis very much, but they did cradle their heads together for a romantic love ballad from one of the other bands.)
</li><li> It seems that a sitcom is doomed as soon as its star/s become/s the "highest paid on television." (Notably, <em>Seinfeld</em>, <em>Frasier</em>, <em>Friends</em>).

Interestingly enough, whilst Bob Geldof went on to devote his fame and connections to one of the greatest humanitarian endeavors of the 1980s, Johnny Rotten of the Pistols, after a decade of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt">Doing It for the Art</a> with his acclaimed experimental band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PublicImageLtd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PublicImageLtd">Public Image Ltd.</a>, was last heard of appearing in a decidedly not-punk butter commercial.
<ul><li> On a related note, while the artists appearing at Live Aid were unpaid, many of them were fully aware of the exposure they would get from their performances. While not entirely a case of this trope, some of the less keen artists were persuaded by their managers (and Bob himself in many cases) to take part because of the resulting publicity that would translate into increased sales.

</li><li> Legendary band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS">KISS</a> is blatantly and unapologetically in it for the money.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tool">tool</a>'s song "Hooker with a Penis" is in response to former fans who accused them of selling out for the money. The song essentially states that every professional musician you've ever heard has sold out for the money, otherwise you'd have never heard their music in the first place. The most telling sequence is "All you know about me is what I've sold you / Dumb fuck / I sold out long before you ever heard my name / I sold my soul to make a record / Dip shit / And you bought one."
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BowlingForSoup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BowlingForSoup">Bowling for Soup</a> song "A Really Cool Dance Song" lampshades this trope. The song is about a band that needs money, so they write a dance song, as dance songs are popular and sell albums.

</li><li> Averted by Swedish pop supergroup <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA">ABBA</a>, who turned down $1 Billion for a reunion.

The band (minus Jello Biafra) now licenses songs for television commercials.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees">The Monkees</a> were on a British interview program just before their 2011 reunion tour kicked off. When asked why they were getting back together again, Peter Tork looked directly into the camera and (jokingly and literally) rubbed his fingers together..
<ul><li> A major reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelNesmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelNesmith">Michael Nesmith</a> usually declines Monkees reunions is because of inheriting his late mother Bette's fortune for inventing liquid paper, making him independently wealthy. He is also hesitant to step away from his Pacific Arts corporation for too long, for fear that the small company may unravel (a fear only compounded by problems with PBS, who bought the company in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, and in which Michael sued successfully in The Nineties).
</li><li> Peter Tork very much falls into this trope. He had the richest musical background of the original group, but like all of them was sidelined by session musicians and got fewer lead vocals than the other three. That's why he was the first to quit. Debt convinced him to go along with the 1986 reunion, although he seems to have started enjoying himself after that.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sting">Sting</a> is often bewildered at "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiLoveSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiLoveSong">Every Breath You Take</a>" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsntItIronic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsntItIronic">interpretation as a romantic song</a>, often played at people's weddings. But the <em>£500,000 a year</em>, he earns from it in royalties as the most played song on UK and US radio probably helps.
<ul><li> This is also likely the reason why Sting, a devoted environmentalist, agreed to shill for Jaguar and Compaq Computers during the promotion of his "Brand New Day" album. The Jaguar deal alone brought in more than 3 million extra sales of the album and covered the costs of promoting the album (as the song "Desert Rose" was played in the commercial). Likewise, Sting and his production team got more than $7 million from Compaq, who sponsored the "Brand New Day Tour". Sting made out like a total bandit at the end of this.
</li></ul></li><li> In his autobiography <em>Life</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithRichards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithRichards">Keith Richards</a> says that he formed the side project X-Pensive Winos in the '80s for several reasons: the Stones were on an indefinite hiatus, Keith wanted to get back on the road, and he still had a lot of bills to pay. Later on, he specifically notes he enjoys the royalties that one of the Winos' songs gets from its inclusion in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSopranos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSopranos">The Sopranos</a></em>. He also talks at length about the fact that the Stones barely broke even in their early years due to a heavily-unfair record company contract, and that the renegotiation of their contract in the early '80s allowed them to get much more royalties than normal, which is why they officially license all their own products (for big paychecks).
</li><li> The song "American Pie" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AmericanPie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AmericanPie">American Pie</a></em> is often debated by music critics for its metaphorical lyrics and veiled references. What exactly does it mean? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonMcLean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonMcLean">Don McLean</a> has been asked several times, and his answer is always the same. 'It means I never have to work again.'
</li><li> An early magazine interview with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who</a> utilized a format where each band member filled in a form answering a standard set of questions. John Entwistle's stated "Personal Ambition" was "To be rich." His "Professional Ambition"? "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment">To be rich</a>."
<ul><li> A sad twist to this is that Pete Townshend partially took The Who on the road in the late <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">1990s</a> to help Entwistle recover from financial problems he had at the time (and partly to distract John from his cocaine habit). Unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">Entwistle died of a heart attack aggravated by cocaine usage</a>.

The band faced financial mismanagement and heavy taxation in England by 1978 and had to enter tax exile in France while the group's lawyers settled the management situation and recovered the band's uninvested money. The album was make-or-break and <em>had</em> to be a smash success to keep the band afloat; the group conceded to co-producer Bob Ezrin's suggestion to give "Another Brick In The Wall Part 2" a disco beat and release it as a single (they were normally very anti-single since the late 1960s). Though the album was certainly a case <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt">Doing It for the Art</a> for <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RogerWaters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RogerWaters">Roger Waters</a>, it would explain much of the pressures between the group that gradually tore them apart.
</li><li> In 1972, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThinLizzy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThinLizzy">Thin Lizzy</a> were asked to record a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeepPurple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeepPurple">Deep Purple</a> cover album, to capitalize on the popularity of that group — they were reluctant because they wanted to focus on building an identity through their own original material, but they needed the money. Phil Lynott felt he couldn't imitate Ian Gillan's vocal style, and they needed a keyboard player because the electric organ was a key part of Deep Purple's sound, so Benny White and Dave Lennox, members of fellow Dublin group Elmer Fudd, were asked to step in for those roles. Ultimately, the album was recorded in one day, consisted of five Deep Purple songs and four <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlbumFiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlbumFiller">Album Filler</a> instrumentals, and was released under the name Funky Junction.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JerryGoldsmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JerryGoldsmith">Jerry Goldsmith</a> used to joke that scoring the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Rambo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Rambo">Rambo</a></em> movies paid for his house. But he <em>wasn't</em> joking when he told an interviewer in 1981 that money was why he did so much TV work in the '70s — he didn't get many big-screen assignments in the first half of that decade.

His film career worked out, as he eventually climbed to Hollywood's highest-paid actor in 2017 after a string of blockbuster hits. He has stated in interviews that he liked wrestling more, but making films paid better, didn't require him to travel as much and didn't take as much of a toll on his body.
</li><li> Wrestler <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinNash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinNash">Kevin Nash</a> has stated in the past year in interviews on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling">TNA</a> iMPACT!</em> that he was only in TNA for the money. After he went back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a>, Nash admitted that he signed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a> for similar reasons: a guaranteed contract and a sweet clause in his contract that allowed him to be paid the same amount of money as the highest-paid guy in the promotion. To sum up his mindset, he once said in an interview "It's funny, they all call it 'the business', but the second you start treating it like a business you're the bad guy."
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MollyHolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MollyHolly">Miss Madness/Mona</a>, a good deal of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCWMondayNitro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCWMondayNitro">WCW Monday Nitro</a> Girls were perfectly fine entertaining the live audience during the commercial breaks and had no desire to get in the ring but agreed to go to the Power Plant because they liked having an income. For this reason, she decided to go easy on them in training.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MollyHolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MollyHolly">Molly Holly</a> was WWE's resident Diva <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> (largely due to her unwillingness to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Ms. Fanservice</a> like the other women they had) but she ended up staying in WWE because it was good money. After a breast cancer scare in 2005, she realized how unhappy she really was there and when WWE refused to let her do the one thing that would have made it bearable for her (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, as she never liked being a heel and had wanted to be a good role model) she asked for her release and retired from wrestling.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Playboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Playboy">Playboy</a> playmate April Hunter stated nudity was the most reliable way to make money as a fitness model. Similar to the Nitro Girls, as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewWorldorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewWorldorder">nWo</a> Girl she agreed to go to the Power Plant when asked by Kevin Nash but admits to not wanting to, correctly assuming pro wrestling would be painful. The Power Plant ended up not training her anyway so she went to Killer Kowalski's school and stuck around even though it did hurt and she hated it because WCW went under while she was there and she figured a former model with big boobs wouldn't get any respect in the business without formal training. Ironically she found many promoters in the USA didn't care and were just happy to have an nWo girl. She did eventually develop some fondness for pro wrestling, but unfortunately, the nude modeling caused WWE to pass on her, and then an injury hamstrung her career.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GailKim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GailKim">Gail Kim</a> hasn't been shy about mentioning how much she prefers TNA to WWE. TNA made her a star; she all but created their Knockouts division, was their first Knockouts champion, and actually headlined a main event of <em>Impact.</em> However, after a pretty nasty contract dispute, she decided to go back to WWE where she was basically turned into scenery. When she realized they would give her three times the money for about a third of the work, she thought she could deal with it. In the end, she couldn't. She quit WWE in 2011 with less than two months to go on her contract and went back to TNA. This was also after she married a celebrity chef, so money was no longer an issue.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting">Sting</a> had no interest in wrestling as a youth and didn't even know what it was because, according to him during his appearance on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimRoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimRoss">''The Ross Report''</a>, he lived in an area where wrestling wasn't shown on TV. He heard the name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> but didn't know who he was until he started working out in his gym. When Borden was approached to become a wrestler, he admits that only did it for the money and fame. Needless to say, he eventually developed a genuine love for wrestling. With that in mind, Sting's talents don't come cheaply (he was reportedly the highest-paid wrestler in WCW for many years, to the point where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottHall">Scott Hall</a> referred to his initial offering as "Sting money") and the reason he left TNA in 2014 and finally joined WWE at least ten years too late was that TNA was in a financial mess and could no longer afford to pay him, along with many other of its top talent.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles">AJ Styles</a>, who many regard as Sting's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> (aided by the fact that Sting more-or-less passed the torch to him at <em>Bound for Glory 2009</em>), has a similar story. He initially got into the business because of the money, and when he learned that you <em>don't</em> make money in wrestling, at least not at first, it was already too late — he had already fallen in love with it. All this being said, this trope has come into play in his career: the first time was during the aftermath of the RF video scandal for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a>, in which AJ chose to stick with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a> because they paid better. This being said, he loved both companies equally, and perhaps stuck around in TNA far longer than he should have due to that. However, during TNA's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Age</a>, the constant creative hamstringing the company put him (and many of his close friends/coworkers) through finally got to him. So when TNA's dire financial straits caught up to them and they offered him a contract with a <em>forty percent pay cut</em>, AJ finally said enough and left. Two years later, after AJ made a lot of money with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling">New Japan Pro-Wrestling</a> and the indie circuit, TNA broke the bank trying to offer him a deal that everyone knew they couldn't back. Unfortunately for them, AJ chose WWE's offer over theirs.
</li></ul></li><li> The same can be said for Sting's former tag team partner the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UltimateWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UltimateWarrior">Ultimate Warrior</a>, who has also admitted that he never watched wrestling and only got involved for the money. He infamously had many monetary disputes with Vince McMahon that resulted in him leaving on bad terms multiple times.
</li><li> A lot of top talent who were pushed relatively early in their career have displayed this attitude. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar">Brock Lesnar</a> is an especially notable case — he was hotshotted to the main event within his first year in the WWE and is a massive draw, but he has never made it a secret that the only reason he ever got involved with the business was for the cash. In fact, his post-UFC return to the WWE was motivated solely by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a>'s offer to let him work part-time for full-time pay. His future wife <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sable">Sable</a> later admitted that she never cared about wrestling and only used the business to get money and become famous. Ditto for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldberg">Goldberg</a> — who in fact wrestled his last match in the WWE with Lesnar, when both were leaving (Lesnar for football, Goldberg because most of his WWE run sucked).
</li><li> It's a common practice for WWE talent scouts to invoke this trope when hiring people from non-wrestling backgrounds. They get offered significantly higher salaries than those who come in from the indies — presumably, so the extra money will make them willing to give wrestling a go.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TinyLister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TinyLister">Tommy 'Tiny' Lister</a> has admitted that he had no intentions of becoming a wrestler and only started wrestling as Zeus because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> offered him a lot of money for it. While he is certainly not ashamed for it, his wrestling career is a bit of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a> for many wrestling fans.
</li><li> This, sadly, leads to many wrestlers staying on well past their prime and performing well into their twilight years, sometimes in small indy shows. Too many wrestlers didn't manage their money responsibly or were wiped out by one or many divorces. Chances are, if you see an ad for an Indy show and it's being headlined by a wrestler who used to be a big name 20+ years ago, this is why.
<ul><li> This is pretty much why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> signed on to TNA. He'd been wiped out by his divorce and needed the cash. This despite a reputation for demanding and getting exorbitant paydays during his career.
</li><li> The same goes for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">Ric Flair</a>'s stint in TNA. Poor money management and a string of divorces left Naitch near broke, despite a 40-year in-ring career.
</li><li> This is also the reason the late Joanie "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Chyna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Chyna">Chyna</a>" Laurer became a pornographic performer.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TammyLynnSytch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TammyLynnSytch">Tammy Lynn Sytch</a> also turned to pornography later in her career, first through pay websites and later signing a full-on deal with Vivid.
</li><li> Tylene Buck (aka Major Gunns) also turned to pornography after her career as a manager went nowhere after WCW released all their female talent.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EdFarhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EdFarhat">The Sheik</a> kept wrestling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RingOldies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RingOldies">when he was well past his prime</a>, since he had lost money on some investments.
</li><li> After losing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWWF</a> World Title to Ivan Koloff in 1971, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrunoSammartino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrunoSammartino">Bruno Sammartino</a> had fully intended on retiring from the wrestling business due to numerous injuries. He spent two years out of the spotlight, working occasionally for promoters he liked. Vince McMahon Sr. offered him an unprecedented contract to come back that arguably made him the highest-paid man in the industry at that point, as well as a part-time road schedule.

<ul><li> Unlike many fighters in MMA, UFC light heavyweight Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson always makes it clear that he's purely in it for the money, much to the confusion/amusement of most interviewers.
</li><li> British boxer Nigel Benn, AKA "The Dark Destroyer", would talk openly about how he was only really in it for the money, and about how there was rarely anything personal against his opponent, how he was seriously worried about the possibility of brain damage, and how he was going to quit boxing as soon as he felt able. The UK boxing press thought this was all a jolly bad show, and gave Benn a rather negative reputation at the time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">Footballer</a> Winston Bogarde became notorious in England for staying at Chelsea despite going over three years without playing for them. Why didn't he move elsewhere? Because Chelsea were paying him <em>£40,000 a week</em>, which was a huge amount back then, especially for a defender. Bogarde knew no-one else would pay him those sorts of wages, and wanted to spite Chelsea for not paying him, so he stuck around for the remainder of his contract.
</li><li> There's a lot of European football/soccer teams which often try and invoke this trope to get reputable players, the idea being those good players will give the club instant success. This also explains why such non-traditional soccer markets such as Russia, Ukraine, and all of the rich countries of the Arabian Peninsula (even tiny Bahrain and Qatar!) can attract big names—who cares about isolation or scorching hot weather when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArabOilSheikh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArabOilSheikh">oil money</a> goes straight into your pocket? China, the fastest-growing economy, is also getting a lot of good if aging stars.
</li><li> Dysfunctional ownership aside, this is one of the reasons why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHockeyLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHockeyLeague">NHL</a> allowed the Atlanta Thrashers to relocate to Winnipeg; the league would not have collected a $60 million relocation fee if they found a new owner committed to keeping the team in Atlanta.
</li><li> After the team then known as the Phoenix Coyotes (now the Arizona Coyotes) filed for bankruptcy in 2009, the city of Glendale, Arizona, which owns and operates Gila River Arena (then known as Jobing.com Arena), paid the NHL $75 million over three seasons (from the 2010-11 season to the lockout-shortened 2012-13 season) for the Coyotes to remain in Arizona while the league searched for a new owner, preferably one committed to keeping the team in Arizona. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note102tv3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note102tv3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note102tv3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The payment for the 2011-12 season was also another factor behind the Atlanta Thrashers' relocation. True North Sports and Entertainment originally intended to buy and move the Coyotes to Winnipeg (as the Coyotes were the <em>original</em> Winnipeg Jets) if the league failed to find a buyer to keep the team in Glendale; however, the Glendale city council elected to cover the Coyotes' losses for another season.</span> Eventually, it worked, as a new buyer was found in 2013.
</li><li> Completing an NHL trifecta, in 2016, an expansion team was granted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LasVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LasVegas">Las Vegas</a> (area untapped by major leagues! huge fee shared with the 30 other teams!) but held up to Quebec (traditional hockey market, but the crowded area and Canadian dollar uncertainties that already drove the previous team away in 1995 made it somehow riskier; also, a Quebec expansion team would likely require an existing team in the Eastern Conference to move west, which is why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seattle">Seattle</a> was favored for the 32nd slot, which requires simply moving one team in the Pacific Division to the Central).
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis">Tennis</a>, the top players typically skip the smaller, non-mandatory tournaments to save time and energy because they don't need the extra ranking points. Because of this, if you <em>do</em> see a top 5 player at some obscure ATP 250 or WTA International event, chances are that a sizeable appearance fee was included somewhere. One specific player example of this would be former top-5 stalwart Nikolay Davydenko, who was quite upfront in admitting that he played in a lot more tournaments than he needed to solely for the additional money.
</li><li> This was why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a> driver <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikiLauda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikiLauda">Niki Lauda</a> came out of retirement and joined McLaren: he had started an airline and needed money for it. It did get him his third title (in the narrowest margin of victory ever, no less), so there's that.
</li><li> Among other things, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OttTanak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OttTanak">Ott Tänak</a> reportedly switched sides with Hyundai in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldRallyChampionship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldRallyChampionship">World Rally Championship</a> as Tänak wanted a business partnership with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MarkkoMartin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MarkkoMartin">Markko Märtin</a> through an R5 rally team, but Toyota team principal Tommi Makinen refused for whatever reason.
</li><li> In the 2014 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup">World Cup</a>, three African teams showed they considered their pay as important as victories: Cameroon delayed their trip because they wanted to get paid before, and while in Brazil one of the players admitted he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney">Only in It for the Money</a>; Ghana threatened to strike during the tournament, only shutting up once a jet filled with cash arrived; and Nigeria also complained with their managers about the prize money.
</li><li> Any time you see a small, lesser-known team playing a powerhouse in college football. Bigger programs pay smaller teams to be a punching bag for 60 minutes and sell tickets while the smaller team often gets more money for a single weekend than their program would for the entire season. Sometimes it backfires, though. Ask any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UniversityOfMichigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UniversityOfMichigan">University of Michigan</a> fan about the Appalachian State game.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11zovw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11zovw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11zovw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There were actually <em>two</em> Appalachian State gamesin 2007 and 2014. Michigan won the 2014 game, but that's not the one everyone remembers. Humorously, the reason Michigan played Appalachian State in the first place in 2007 was that Michigan backed out of a game against the University of Hawaii, who won 11 games the year prior and would go undefeated in the 2007 regular season. Michigan scheduled Appalachian State thinking they'd have an easier opponent.</span> Or any University of North Texas fan about the Portland State game.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12lckm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12lckm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12lckm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In 2015, North Texas paid Portland State, an FCS team, $425,000 to come to Denton for a game. UNT ended up on the wrong end of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle">667 blowout</a>, with the Mean Green only scoring in the final minute.

<ul><li> 1960s crooner Johnny Mathis confessed he did the famous theme song to Trans Lux's <em>The Mighty Hercules</em> cartoon series purely for the cash plus residuals; nothin' wrong with that!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryShearer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryShearer">Harry Shearer</a> is of two minds about the money he makes from the show, saying that he and the cast get paid too much and too little at the same time (too much, since they really do get paid an obscene amount, and too little because the amount is still a minuscule fraction of what their work makes for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Fox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Fox">Fox</a>). He's been highly critical of the show's quality, he has never done a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary">DVD Commentary</a>, and the actors (himself included) are some of the highest-paid in animation.
</li><li> This may be true for most of the cast, given their infamous salary disputes with Fox over the decades that led to them being the highest-paid voice actors on TV. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattGroening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattGroening">Matt Groening</a>, despite his producer credit, always sided with the actors during these fights... until Fox threatened to cancel the show outright unless the actors took a pay cut.
</li><li> This is part of the reason Matt Groening made <em>The Simpsons</em> at all. Fox originally approached him about doing a cartoon version of his indie comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/LifeInHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/LifeInHell">Life in Hell</a></em>, but then at the last minute, he learned that Fox was planning to make him sign away <em>all</em> of his rights to the series (this included giving Fox executives creative control over the original comic itself). Unwilling to give up <em>Life In Hell</em>, but still wanting that sweet Hollywood money, Matt hastily sketched a family-based heavily upon his own (including the names). The rest is history.
</li><li> Also an in-universe example in "The Book Job", in which Homer, Bart, and some others write a book purely to make money, while Lisa, trying to write a book for the love of writing, gets into a serious case of writer's block. Meanwhile, the financially-driven book winds up being so good that Homer and the others end up caring more about the final work than the money they stand to gain from it.
</li></ul></li><li> Why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DannyElfman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DannyElfman">Danny Elfman</a> wound up doing the official theme to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em> instead of series composer Shirley Walker. Originally, the theme was supposed to be the heroic refrain heard in each episode (usually when Batman is swooping into action) and the opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanMaskOfThePhantasm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanMaskOfThePhantasm">Batman: Mask of the Phantasm</a></em>, but after Elfman saw the influx of royalty money he was getting from his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> theme, he took up the offer to do a rearrangement of his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989">Batman (1989)</a></em> theme for the animated show (which also used his film theme in a couple of early episodes), as well as scoring themes for several other television shows later. Which would certainly explain his involvement with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PointPleasant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PointPleasant">Point Pleasant</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FiftyShadesOfGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FiftyShadesOfGrey">Fifty Shades of Grey</a></em>...
</li><li> Donald F. Glut, one of the writers for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em>, has admitted to disliking the series, and said that he did it strictly for the money:
<div class="indent"> None of the writing on this series, in my opinion, was good or passionate or, sometimes (my own included, like The Autobot Run) even adequate. But we got paid well for writing them fast.
</div></li><li> An in-universe example in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em> episode "Pre-Teen Scream" was when pop "singer" Ronnie Matthews admits to Phoebe Heyerdahl that he was only a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainlessBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainlessBeauty">handsome</a> manufactured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singer</a> who merely entered the music industry for money and glamour rather than genuine talent.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder19');">    Other </div><div class="folder" id="folder19" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> A meme of one of the villains from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerryTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerryTheMovie">Tom and Jerry: The Movie</a></em> saying "We've got to have money!" is used all over the internet to represent this trope, usually in a mocking manner.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/MAD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/MAD">MAD</a></em> magazine's satire of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyIII">Rocky III</a></em>. In the second-to-last panel, we see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByTheLightsOfTheirEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByTheLightsOfTheirEyes">a few pairs of eyes</a> in the darkness of the fight's audience, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeechBubbles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeechBubbles">Speech Bubbles</a>: "Yep, he set himself up for another sequel." "Why does he do it?" "The same reason we ALL do it!" In the final panel, the speakers are revealed to be movie characters, among them, Brody from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws">Jaws</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Darth Vader</a>. They cry in unison, <strong>"MONEY!!!!"</strong>
</li><li> In general, this trope is the relationship between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero">Superhero</a> comics and their adaptations: While the comics are the official canon, the "real" money is in the movies and the merchandise.
<ul><li> The same applies to manga and anime. Some artists really push for their manga to be adapted to anime, as that's where the money really is.
</li></ul></li><li> Individuals who enter competitions online also count for this trope. Their motives for <em>why</em> they need the money obviously vary, but for some, it's seen as a quick way to try, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoChallengeEqualsNoSatisfaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoChallengeEqualsNoSatisfaction">the challenge as well</a>. It may not even matter if the other prizes are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndesirablePrize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndesirablePrize">less desirable</a>, the money is the main thing for these people, known <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">as "compers"</a>.
</li><li> The Thorn <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CiviTEQ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CiviTEQ">Civi TEQ</a> LED streetlight is this for Austrian streetlighting company Thorn Lighting. Although designs such as the Thorn Isaro are more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeDearBoy">Awesome, Dear Boy</a>, this trope is <em>the</em> reason Lancashire County Council went for the Thorn <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CiviTEQ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CiviTEQ">Civi TEQ</a> across Lancashire (excluding Blackburn with Darwen and Blackpool, who are separate local authorities not under their jurisdiction) even though there were other designs on offer.
</li><li> While some of the women on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Playboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Playboy">Playboy</a></em> want a push on their careers, most probably want the paycheck - helps that sometimes the cover model will get a bonus based on how copies her issue sells.
