<ul><li> Despite its iconic status in North America, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> is home to a few wonky issues that frustrated many kids back in the 80s:
<ul><li> First, in an attempt to distance themselves from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatVideoGameCrashOf1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatVideoGameCrashOf1983">The Great Video Game Crash of 1983</a>, Nintendo of America ditched the traditional top-loading cartridge mechanism used by the NES's Japanese counterpart, the Family Computer, for a "zero insertion force" slot: The cartridge is slid into the front of the system and then pressed down, similar to a VCR. Unfortunately, this mechanism was infamous for being unreliable and constantly causing the infamous "flashing screen of death", as well as gradually bending the pins in the cartridge. It gets even worse today considering the system's been long out of production and many functioning NESes are in fairly worn states today, with all official repair services for them having been discontinued a long time ago<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0h3ah');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0h3ah" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0h3ah');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Thankfully you can buy third-party replacement cartridge slots that are quite easy to install, requiring nothing more than disassembling the console and swapping them out (they pressure-fit to the circuit board), but it's nevertheless something a lot of people wouldn't be comfortable doing and unless you know how to properly ground yourself you risk burning out one of the console's chips with an errant static shock which would irreparably ruin the entire console</span>.
</li><li> On games with battery-backed saves, when you power the system off, you must hold down the reset button while shutting the system off, or else your saved changes will be discarded. Presumably common practice back in the system's age, but nowadays, most players used to just turning the system off normally after saving their game may not know to do this or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory">forget to do so</a>.
</li><li> Two pins used for hardware expansion in the Famicom's cartridge slot were removed from the cartridge slot of the NES, resulting in an inferior audiovisual game experience for some games <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadExportForYou">compared to the Japanese version</a> (such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaIIIDraculasCurse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaIIIDraculasCurse">Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse</a></em>) and causing some games to just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">not get exports of any kind</a> due to relying on cartridge-side expansion chips to run properly (such as the Famicom adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius">Gradius</a> II</em>).
</li><li> Even though the NES's Japan-region counterpart, the Famicom, is known for being more durable and more developer-friendly than the NES, it does have one noticable design choice: the controllers are <em>hard-wired</em> into the console, meaning there's no easy replacements if either controller gets damaged.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a>'s 240x160 screen was able to show <em>amazing</em> graphics for the time, but it created some problems when it came time to port games from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>'s 256X240 and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperNintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperNintendo">Super Nintendo</a>'s 256X224 resolution. Particularly, as the GBA screen was wider it resulted in games having to be "trimmed" vertically to fit, which added <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">Fake Difficulty</a> to titles like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManAndBass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManAndBass">Mega Man &amp; Bass</a></em>: enemy and hazard placements that were visible on the SNES would be off-screen on the GBA, and it was <em>very</em> easy to ram into unseen hazards. <em>Mario World</em> made up for it by adding features that made other aspects of the game easier (saving wherever you wanted, keeping accumulated lives when you save and quit, and spawning colored Yoshis in levels), while games like <em>Mega Man and Bass</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">did not</a>.

<ul><li> With past Nintendo handhelds, there's no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RegionCoding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RegionCoding">Region Coding</a>, so if you're traveling abroad and you see a game you want to buy, or a game you want is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">not available in your region</a>, you can grab it and immediately start playing it on your different-region device. The 3DS, however, is the first Nintendo handheld system to lock out games based on region, much to the ire of import collectors and fans, with no publicly-announced plans to address this. While there are hacks to disable the region-lock, these can cause problems with your 3DS, from voiding the warranty and disqualifying it from official repair services to outright bricking the system, and even if they don't Nintendo will more often than not patch them by the next system update.
</li><li> There are two ways to add friends: Locally via local wireless, or via Internet by exchanging friend codes. For whatever reason, you can't provisionally add friend codes if your 3DS is not connected, unlike with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a> games, and there are many possible use cases where you can't meet with the other player locally but also cannot connect your 3DS to the Internet. You could use a smartphone as a mobile hotspot (aka "tethering"), but not every 3DS user owns a smartphone, and mobile providers can disable tethering unless you switch to one of their other plans that does offer it.
</li><li> The microSD Card slot on the New 3DS requires using a screwdriver to gain access to, just so you can do things like access your photos and screenshots on your PC, unlike the non-New 3DS and both 2DS models where you simply pop off a tab with your finger to acceess the slot. There is an option in the Settings area to allow data on the microSD card to be sent over a network via SMB (Windows file sharing), thus sidestepping the entire screwdriver issue, but the location of this option is only intuitive in hindsight and is notoriously finicky regardless. To date, nobody has found a way to get a non-Windows computer to reliably connect to the New 3DS's variety of network sharing.
</li><li> <em>Anything</em> that strictly relies on StreetPass becomes this if you do not live in Japan, due to the lack of population density coupled with relative popularity of handheld gaming in most other countries. You can stroll around even the busiest of metropolitan areas in the US and be lucky to StreetPass even <em>one</em> other player. Your only options for farming them in bulk will be to attend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanConvention">Fan Conventions</a> and other events geared towards video game players, or to find a StreetPass Relay point that's somehow still functioning. And with the Switch in full swing and Nintendo quietly sidelining the 3DS at the end of the 2010s, even going to Japan or conventions is no guarantee when more and more people are leaving their 3DSes at home or selling them outright in favor of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a>.
</li><li> The New 3DS's and New 2DS's C-stick is derided for having the feel of a pencil eraser or a laptop mouse nub compared to the full Circle Pad provided by the Circle Pad Pro, which is <em>not</em> compatible with these versions of the 3/2DS (partly because the ZL and ZR buttons on the system itself are in the way). Furthermore, it can wear down over time, particularly if you have long nails. Sure, the built-in C-stick means you don't have to carry a bulky accessory that runs on a separate battery if you want to play games that require that secondary analog input or at least play better with it, but it's just not as comfortable to use as a full-sized Circle Pad, especially for games that make heavy use of a secondary analog (such as all three 3DS <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em> games and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/KidIcarusUprising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/KidIcarusUprising">Kid Icarus: Uprising</a></em> if you're left-handed).
</li></ul></li><li> While older Nintendo systems not having any sort of cloud backup for save data is obviously expected, this has become a glaring problem with their net-enabled platforms, particularly the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii">Wii</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS">Nintendo 3DS</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a>, despite their competitors<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10u19');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10u19" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10u19');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360">Xbox 360</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3">PlayStation 3</a> for the Wii, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PSVita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PSVita">PS Vita</a> for the 3DS, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne">Xbox One</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4">PlayStation 4</a> for the Wii U</span> offering such solutions (granted, you have to pay for Sony's, but at least it's <em>there</em>). Losing your save data to storage corruption or through losing the system outright and having to buy a new one is already harsh enough, but just to rub salt in the wound, if you have to send your system to Nintendo for repairs, they may have to erase your hard-earned saved data depending on the type of the problem. 3DS users can sometimes get around this by purchasing their games physically instead of on the eShop (and many players will boycott the eShop for this reason alone), as many games can save data to the Game Card, but some games only save some data to it (usually, the SD Card data created by the game is just StreetPass data, at the least), or just write all save data to the SD Card which leads back to this problem. <br/><br/>While game <em>purchases</em> can be transferred from a lost or data-corrupted system to a new one by calling Nintendo and providing some details, those details do include the serial numbers of both devices (hope you keep track of your systems' serial numbers), and this does not transfer saves at all unlike the system-to-system transfer that the user does. <br/><br/>Nintendo seems to have <em>finally</em> listened to this when it comes to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a>; cloud backup for save data rolled out as part of their subscription-based online service in September 2018. It helps, because <em>all</em> Switch games, even those on Game Cards, save data entirely to the Switch's internal memory. Unfortunately, not all games' save data are supported.
</li><li> Every 3DS comes with an SD card and the "new" 3DS line comes with a microSD card, but they only offer a paltry 2 and 4 GB respectively. While this is usually no problem for small games like third party indie titles or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualConsole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualConsole">Virtual Console</a> games, big budget titles like a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> game can eat up far more memory storage than the included SD card can hold. Even if you know this ahead of time and purchase an SD card, the 3DS has another issue regarding the storage size of said SD cards. Using any SD card that's bigger than 32 GB will not work due the 3DS only accepting SD cards in the FAT32 format (larger SD cards use the ExFAT format. While it is very easy to format larger SD cards to be in FAT32, most people that aren't tech savvy won't know about it.
</li><li> Konami's eAMUSEMENT services goes down for maintenance on a daily basis, from 5 AM to 7 AM Japan time; during this time, players cannot log into the eAMUSEMENT network on games using it to access their personal data (including score records, unlocks, and the like); anyone attempting to play at the time will be forced into "guest" mode where only a subset of features will be available. This isn't a problem for players in Asia, as most arcades are closed at the time, but this becomes a hassle for players in the United States, as due to time zones maintenance happens in early to mid-afternoon over there as a result.
</li><li> The PlayStation line as a whole has the "confirm" and "cancel" buttons traditionally be depending on what region console you have. For Japan-region consoles, O is to confirm and X is to cancel, derived from the idea that "O is yes, X is no". However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalTranslation">it's the other way around for Western-region consoles, referring to the concept of "X marks the spot" and because the O/X concept isn't really well-known outside of Japan</a>. Is your "home" region US or PAL and you want to import Japanese games, or vice versa? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory">Prepare for a lot of accidental menu mishaps.</a>
</li><li> Nintendo's "Friend Code" system. The idea is that players receive unique randomly-generated numbers instead of usernames, because of the idea that someone could come up with obscene usernames even if Nintendo implemented username-censoring, which would be bad for Nintendo's family-friendly image. It also has the advantage of allowing users to freely change their names, unlike on competitors' consoles where display name is also player ID and changing name costs a fee (Microsoft) or is not allowed (Sony). However, even by the standards of randomly-generated user IDs, it's had its share of problems, which have thankfully been recitified over time:
<ul><li> Players who want to add each other need to mutually add each other; if one player puts in the other's FC and the other doesn't reciprocate, they're not registered. This made the practice of putting one's FC in their forum signature, social media profile, etc. largely useless. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a> eliminated this issue, only requiring that one party disclose their friend code; in case parents are concerned about their children getting adds from unfamiliar players, there is the option to disable friend requests.
</li><li> On the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a>, every single game uses its own FCs. Which means if you had<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2tbji');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2tbji" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2tbji');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Nintendo WFC network, used for Nintendo DS and Wii games, was closed down in 2014.</span> a friend you played <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKartDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKartDS">Mario Kart DS</a></em> with, and you wanted to also play <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tetris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tetris">Tetris</a> DS</em>, <em>Clubhouse Games</em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PanelDePon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PanelDePon">Planet Puzzle League</a></em> with them, for example, you had to repeat the adding process for <em>each one of these games</em>. This was thought to be fixed with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii">Wii</a> with one FC for each system...only for Nintendo WFC-enabled games to continue to use the separate-FC-for-each-game system! This was finally eliminated with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS">Nintendo 3DS</a>, with games using the system's existing friend list instead of requiring separate FCs.
</li></ul></li><li> The non-DSi Nintendo DS does not support wifi hotspots with WPA or WPA2 security, meaning that back when Nintendo WFC was in service, if you wanted to play games online you had to either spend money on a USB dongle that requires a PC running Windows XP or higher or downgrade the security of your router to WEP, which has been shown to be crackable even by someone with minimal hacking skills compared to WPA and especially WPA2 wireless security.
<ul><li> The 3DS and the Switch do support WPA2...but only the standard, "personal" variant of it that only asks for a password, not WPA2-Enterprise which requires a username along with a password, and the 3DS and Switch don't let you enter a username when trying to connect to wireless networks.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3xuvr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3xuvr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3xuvr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">While WPA2-Enterprise is mainly designed with companies in mind to prevent non-employees from using the network, and about the only time you'll see employees on game systems is on lunch breaks that are 30-60 minutes long, it also sees use at colleges and universities, where game systems are far more likely to be used and students have a lot more free time.</span>
</li><li> Worse, the 3DS's WPA2 support does not extend to its DS emulation. Even if the rest of the system is happily on a WPA2 router, the DS subsystem comes with its own wifi configuration screen, one which mimics the DS's to the point of <em>only supporting WEP security</em>. So if you picked up a 3DS with the hopes of getting in on the tail end of DS WFC without downgrading your router or using a dongle, you were out of luck.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari2600" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari2600">Atari 2600</a> controller has its sole button to the left of the joystick, making it unusable for left-handed players unless you open the controller up to mod it. Imagine being a kid in the 70s, going to your friend's house where said friend has multiple controllers for you and your friends to use, only to be unable to play effectively or competitively with them because you don't have the right-hand dexterity needed to use one of their controllers. Sure, you can just plug in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a> controller now since it uses the same connector, but that wasn't an option in the 70's.
</li><li> The "classic" model of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360">Xbox 360</a> is infamous for being the only console of its generation to require an adapter for Wi-Fi connectivity, which can be troublesome if your 360 is somewhere where an Ethernet cable can't reach easily. While Wi-Fi may not be as suitable for multiplayer gaming as a good old wired connection, this is still a glaring disadvantage for those who just want to receive game and system updates as well as purchase games digitally.
</li><li> Nintendo's net-enabled consoles:
<ul><li> They suffer from the opposite problem the Xbox 360 has: While they come with Wi-Fi support, they don't innately come with Ethernet ports, requiring you to invest in a USB Ethernet adapter if you want optimal connection speeds and ping time.
</li><li> On the Wii, 3DS, and Wii U, you cannot go into the Home Menu while online in a game, not even to, say, adjust brightness options. The Switch has the opposite problem: You <em>can</em> go into the Home Menu, but if you stick around for more than about 5 seconds you will be abruptly disconnected in whatever game you're playing, almost like an unintentional example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">Schmuck Bait</a>. This leads to an irritatingly common problem for those not familiar with this: Player decides to open their island gate on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossingNewHorizons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossingNewHorizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a></em> and friends decide to join, player gets a friend request and accepts it, the connection is lost so everyone is kicked off their island with all unsaved changes lost.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a> allowed most games to be played on the gamepad so that no one can hog the TV while playing. While this sounds like a good idea in theory, the gamepad has to be within the same room as the console itself or it can't communicate with it due to the effective range being just a mere few feet. This means that you can't, for example, take the gamepad with you to the bathroom if nature calls. This flaw was addressed with the Wii U's successor, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a>, which can be played anywhere.
</li><li> Nintendo has made their consoles with very limited storage space for the sake of keeping costs down, yet this caused more problems than it solves. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii">Wii</a> came with a paltry 512MB of storage that would quickly fill up if you bought a lot of games on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualConsole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualConsole">Virtual Console</a> or had games with large save files. Nintendo would eventually release a patch that would allow people to save their games onto an SD card and load from there, but that also had its issues; booting a game from the SD card would temporarily make a copy of the data onto the Wii itself before loading, which meant that you couldn't run the game if you had no room left.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a> came in two versions when it came to storage. Nintendo offered an 8GB model (white) and a 32GB model (black). Since you could download games as an alternative to buying a physical copy, storage space could fill up pretty darn fast. The 8GB model sold poorly and was quietly discontinued shortly after launch. SD cards could be used, but only up to 32GB due to needing to be cross compatible with the storage system emulation for Wii Mode. The Wii U did allow external USB hard drives to be used (up to 2TB), but only certain drives were allowed while others were either risky to use or simply did not work. On top of that, the hard drive could only be used for Wii U applications.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a> comes with 32GB of storage like the Wii U before it. SD cards up to 2TB can be used to for more storage. The game cards can hold between 1GB to 32GB of data, but the bigger ones cost more money. Because costs to produce a game for the Switch in a physical copy is more expensive, some developers have opted to using a smaller sized game card and having their customers download the rest from Nintendo's eShop to cut down the costs; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom2016">DOOM (2016)</a></em> only has single player mode in the physical copy version and you have to download the multiplayer modes if you want to play them. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NBA2K" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NBA2K">NBA 2K</a></em> requires an SD card just to download the <em>rest of the game</em> if you're playing off a game card.
</li></ul></li><li> Both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64">Nintendo 64</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameCube">GameCube</a> unfortunately have analog sticks that are rather delicate and susceptible to wear and tear. This leads to the infamous "looseness" of the stick that can either make it less sensitive or unable to be pushed to its "full" position, and will eventually happen even after normal use. Some games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero">F-Zero</a> GX</em> allow the player to calibrate the stick's range of movement and deadzone, but these only apply to the games you calibrate the sticks on. Thankfully you can buy replacement analog sticks that are actually <em>better</em> than the original hardware and will last much longer, but installing them into a controller of course requires some knowledge and confidence doing such things that many consumers simply don't have.
</li><li> The Nintendo Switch is widely regarded as the best Nintendo console since the Super NES, and its record sales numbers show, however that doesnt mean its without its problems (in addition to the ones mentioned above):
<ul><li> The Switch's kickstand, while useful in a pinch if you want to play two-player games with someone in portable mode, only has one very upright position, making it uncomfortable to look at the screen unless whatever surface it's on is almost at eye-level, and if you're at a dining room or coffee shop table, it most certainly will not be. Also, since the charging/USB-C port is on the same side as the kickstand, you can't use the Switch in stand mode and charge at the same time, unless you invest in a third-party stand that allows access to the port.
</li><li> If you hold down the Home button instead of pressing it, you'll get an abridged system menu where you can put the console into sleep mode, airplane mode (if the Switch is in portable mode rather than docked), and system volume. The last setting would be useful if you don't wanna fuddle with the volume buttons (especially since they're next to the power button, which can be easy to press by mistake in a dark environment), <em>however</em> the game volume is lowered while the system mini-menu is active, even as you adjust the volume from within it, so unless you're willing to call and hide the mini-menu repeatedly, you're better off just using the physical volume buttons.
</li><li> Despite the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter">Twitter</a> started allowing 280-character tweets in late 2017, when you share a screenshot to Twitter you are still limited to 140 characters. You'll have to copy the screenshot off of your SD Card and post it with some other device to get around this. This shortfall only stood out even more in a fall 2018 update that allows posting up to four photos in a single tweet...but <em>still</em> doesn't let you post more than 140 characters.
</li><li> You have no way of copying screenshots and videos off of your Switch except through social media posts (and you cannot change post privacy or easily switch between Twitter accounts; many Twitter users have more than one account<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4vv9q');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4vv9q" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4vv9q');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Usually a "main" account and a "private" account</span>) or powering down the entire system to safely remove the SD card. While it's still in a way better than using a screwdriver like on the New 3DS, at least that had <em>some</em> way of copying files off of your system onto your PC without powering the system down and removing the SD card.
</li><li> Hori produced a special Joy-Con L that replaces the directional buttons with a proper D-pad, designed for games that strictly use 8-way digital directional movement. Unfortunately, because it doesn't connect wirelessly, it can only be used in Handheld Mode, not in TV or Tabletop modes.
</li><li> The Switch counts two Joy-Cons as separate controllers even if used in tandem or put in a Joycon grip controller. While this is usually not an issue as most games only allow up to 4 players, in games that 8 players are a possibility like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></em>, to allow 5 players or more means at least 2 players will need to either use the Joy Con stand alone (which can be uncomfortable with some players due to the controller's smaller size) or be forced to get Pro Controllers and/or GameCube controllers with the Adapter (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper">which is a blow to the wallet</a>).
</li><li> The Switch's voice chat has been heavily criticized for requiring a smart device to use, a bit of a baffling decision considering that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii">Wii</a> (until the shutdown of Nintendo WFC) did directly support voice chat in the form of the WiiSpeak accessory. While the Switch's audio jack <em>can</em> support audio input in addition to output and thus some games such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fortnite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fortnite">Fortnite</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillerQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillerQueen">Killer Queen</a> Black</em> allow simply plugging a headset into the jack for voice communication, very few games support it, none of which are first-party games.
</li><li> The Switch prioritizes the microSD card for downloads if one is inserted. This by itself is a small if noticeable annoyance for those who prefer to use the internal storage for patches and DLC for their games, but what makes it even more tedious is that the console does not let the user move data between the two destinations in the settings<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0gjz3');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0gjz3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0gjz3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Something that the Wii allowed, both when downloading from the Shop Channel and when managing data</span>. Instead, you have to first archive the software or game in question, turn off the console and remove the SD Card, then start it up again and redownload the necessary data. And if you forgot to archive, then re-insert the card after it's done and restarted? The console will promptly delete the downloaded data from the internal storage, forcing you to repeat it again. If it's a game that gets frequent patches or DLC, be prepared to repeat this plenty of times.
<ul><li> The 10.0.0 firmware update finally added this option, making moving data much quicker and convenient. Unfortunately, save data can still not be moved using this method.

<ul><li> The main design flaw with the original GunCon for the PS1 is that the two side buttons are near the front of the barrel, necessitating a "one hand on the grip and the other on the barrel" grip for games that make heavy use of these side buttons, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeCrisis">Time Crisis</a></em>, making it harder to wail on the trigger whenever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">a high firing rate is needed</a>. This would get addressed with the GunCon 2 for the PS2, where the auxilary buttons are in multiple places — right above the trigger and slightly behind it, on the back of the barrel, and where the magazine would eject on a real gun — allowing the player more ways to hold the gun.
</li><li> The GunCon 3 has a half-gamepad on the side of the barrel with two trigger buttons and an analog stick, to be used in certain contexts like the console-exclusive mode of <em>Time Crisis 4</em>. Unfortunately, it's mounted on the left side of the barrel and you cannot change this. It's clear Namco did not have left-handed players in mind when designing this controller.
</li></ul></li><li> All of Nintendo's online-enabled systems use peer-to-peer connections instead of linking devices to a dedicated server, a design that creates problems particularly for those who try to play with those halfway across the planet, as well as those who play only to be bogged down with lag because one player out of four is using a low-quality connection, especially if it's a wifi connection. This makes <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> in particular absolutely intolerable online for competitive players unless all participants live close by and have near-perfect Internet connections, due to online <em>Smash</em> turning into a slideshow if <em>anyone's</em> connection is poor. <em>Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics</em> on Switch is known to lag even in <em>turn-based games</em> (you can spend literally <em>a minute</em> just watching the opening cutscene of a game if anyone's connection is particularly bad). The fact that the Switch requires a paid subscription for online play yet uses P2P anyway is a primary source of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a> for its users. The Switch <em>does</em> support dedicated servers, but so far the only games to do so are games that have cross-platform capability, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fortnite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fortnite">Fortnite</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RocketLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RocketLeague">Rocket League</a></em>.
</li><li> Almost nobody who runs an arcade or collects arcade hardware likes dealing with Konami's Bubble System hardware, used for some of their games, most notably <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius">Gradius</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwinBee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwinBee">TwinBee</a></em>. To make a long story short, it uses "bubble memory", an early attempt at memory hardware that doesn't use moving parts unlike floppy disks or hard drives. Unfortunately, the Bubble System imposes a waiting timer in order to warm the hardware up to operating temperature, and it is very fragile and vulnerable to electromagnetic fields, which are everywhere in your usual arcade due to how many other cabinets are present. Bubble System games ended up being ported to more traditional ROM chips for overseas releases.
</li><li> On <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam">Steam</a>, soundtracks were classified as DLC meaning you must purchase the base game in order to purcahse them as well. It did not matter if you already purchased the game through another retailer or for another platform, or if you just wanted the soundtrack and not the game. While some publishers are kind enough to sell soundtracks through services that are independent of whether you bought the game or not (such as Bandcamp or itch.io), not every publisher does it. However, this was changed in January 2020 so that soundtracks can finally be bought as standalone purchases, without having to purchase the game.
</li><li> Games (single-player games especially) that are dependent on a central server, which basically means that the game only functions as long as the publisher allows it, and as soon as they get tired enough of running these servers and shut them down it nobody can ever play the game again. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/RosssGameDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/RosssGameDungeon">Ross Scott</a> in particular - a huge proponent of game preservation - considers this one of gaming's greatest sins, and has covered multiple games that have been "killed" by this method of DRM.
</li><li> Messaging was changed on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4">PlayStation 4</a>, where it becomes more akin to the prior console's party chat mode. This can be fairly irritating when people randomly pull you into group chats where you know nobody in the room, but the only other option is restricting DMs to friends only, which deprives you of any mail you'd receive short of messages from Sony themselves.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a> can have two of the same console linked up for certain multiplayer games, giving each player an entire screen to work with. This wouldn't be a Scrappy Mechanic in and of itself, but a lot of games, particularly PS1 games, have multiplayer that <em>only</em> supports linked consoles and not split-screen or online multiplayer (and PS1 has no online capability), meaning that one will need to have not only two controllers, but two of the same console, two of the same game, and two screens (one for each console), and space to have all of these set up. Other consoles can do this sort of setup too, but at least their games almost never make it mandatory to have this sort of multi-console setup and will have split-screen available, and online play lets you have your own screen for multiplayer but without needing the systems and screens next to each other or even in the same building.

<ul><li> It can be a real irritant trying to gain Intel from an Uruk who is encountered in a large group, due to the way they can <em>unintentionally</em> be killed in melee. Even worse is watching the intel-bearing orc flee from you, into the jaws of a random <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpider">caragor</a>, which eats him before he can be interrogated. It would have been nice if the designers had followed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamOrigins">Batman: Arkham Origins</a></em>' lead and made it impossible to kill your informant. At least there are other ways to get Intel (finding it in the world or freeing slaves).
</li><li> At least on the PS4, the same button (triangle) is used in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OptionalStealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OptionalStealth">stealth mode</a> for "Attract" and "<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheresNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheresNoKillLikeOverkill">Brutalize</a></em>". This can be a real pain, especially during stealth missions, when you're trying to lead an orc away for a discreet stealth kill using Attract, only for the button's function to suddenly switch to Brutalize, which makes for an <em>intentionally</em> loud and indiscreet kill. Similarly, the same button (circle) is used for dropping to hang off of ledges and Stealth Drain. You may simply be trying to better position yourself along a ledge for a Stealth Kill/Brutalize only for the function to change, leading to you attacking with a non-lethal Drain.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Branded Captains</a> lose their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity">immunity to instant death when being thrown over a ledge</a>. This is extremely problematic and annoying for two major reasons: One, they have a tendency to run in and attempt to assist when you're fighting near them. If you happen to be near a ledge (which is often given the geology and structures of Mordor), it's entirely possible to knock your branded Captain off accidentally. Two, the act of branding them requires grabbing onto them. After branding them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Talion</a> has a habit of releasing them by tossing them backward, which can be right off a ledge. It's quite frustrating to track a Captain down, kill all of his followers, get his health down enough so that he can be grabbed, and then actually brand him only to have him uncontrollably <em>thrown off a ledge</em> immediately after. Your only recourse is to try and grab/brand him away from any ledges, but this is hard to manage when you're in the heat of combat with Uruk reinforcements close by (as getting hit by one interrupts the brand attempt).

First off, it's a puzzle designed like a gigantic maze. What makes it annoying is that some foods take <em>ages</em> just to get to, and once you make it to them, you have to retrace your steps, so that needlessly doubles the amount of time it takes. Even worse, you have to be right next to the vegetable in order to get it or get ready to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingVideoGameHelper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingVideoGameHelper">be told you can't pick it over and over again.</a> It doesn't help at all that the movements cannot be skipped at all, unlike the rest of the game.

It can only be refilled by wandering the game looking for "chrons" and watching an unskippable cutscene each time you find one. But you're unlikely to even need this, as you only lose health for "digging" in the wrong place, and most of the digging puzzles are very simple — making the whole thing pointless if you're playing through the game normally.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeFromMonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeFromMonkeyIsland">Escape from Monkey Island</a></em> is possibly the worst offender in this regard thanks to the late-game introduction of "MONKEY KOMBAT". The idea is that, by chanting a certain combination of four different monkey sounds, the player adopts one of five different fighting stances, all of which have a 50/50 chance of either winning or losing, like an overly complicated game of Rock Paper Scissors. The Monkey Island series has had its fair share of game-halting "insult swordfighting" sections, but Monkey Kombat takes the cake for worst combat system in a Lucasarts game by virtue of it being entirely unclear which stances beat which, on top of it being a grind to even figure out the stances.

</li><li> Stickie Note has Hamtaro using the Stickie ham chat to catch falling pieces of paper. The chat animation only stops if Hamtaro catches one which means it will play through if he doesn't get any. Since you can't stop it yourself, you have to wait a few seconds to try it again.

<ul><li> Unlike most games with RPG elements, NPCs in <em>The Sleeping King</em> don't have unique dialogue bound to them unless they're important to the story or want you to run an errand for them. Inconsequential NPCs, on the other hand, spout quotes randomly selected from a text bank assigned to that town. This can be irritating if you talk to everybody: multiple NPCs might say the exact same thing, or the player can simply cycle through all the possible dialogue by speaking to the same NPC repeatedly. Yet this tends to be little more than irritating, as the townsfolk that this applies to generally don't have anything particularly important or helpful to say.
</li><li> The World Map is only useful for indicating the general area of your next objective, and your position relative to it. The map itself is so low-resolution and lacking in detail (even zoomed in!) that it's mostly useless for planning an actual path, or pinpointing the exact location of, well, almost anything.

<ul><li> The 2 player mode is cruel enough to force both players to restart a section if either one runs out of lives. Most of the time, the surviving player will be low on lives and be the one to run out next time. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd">The Angry Video Game Nerd</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">Kyle Justin</a> ranted about this long before reaching the eleventh stage, which has an out-and-out bug that makes it impossible in 2 player.
</li><li> As if the game weren't hard enough already, you can't turn off the friendly fire in the game (though you could in later <em>Battletoads</em> games), making it extremely easy to punch/kick/headbutt your ally in co-op by accident. This really, really sucks in the descending level (level 2), where your toad will turn into a wrecking ball and instantly kill any enemy <em>or friend</em> who is even roughly parallel to him, simply because you pressed the attack button.

<ul><li> Out-of-body fights. They're tolerable in the story mode, where you're given tools to whale on angels with and Cereza isn't constantly in danger, but when they're made an Alfheim challenge, you have to leave your body behind to fight; that won't stop the angels from going after it anyway (which will hurt your regular lifebar), unless you waste one of your two accessory slots on an item that forces Angels to attack you... but also makes them <em>stronger</em>. That very mechanic forces you to use a <em>lightpole</em> to fight Affinities while protecting Cereza, since they are not in the same dimension. Not only is the "weapon" painfully slow, it slips out of your hands if you stop to dodge an attack. Granted, you can use <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmyWeapon">Rodin</a></span> to attack them directly but the thing is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">not exactly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">easy</a> to get...
</li><li> The mini-game to send Jubileus into the sun isn't so bad in Normal mode. In Hard and Climax mode however the planets are much harder to avoid, and failure is counted as a death, which can completely ruin an otherwise perfect score. Considering how long and difficult this fight can be, this is frustrating to say the least.
</li><li> Insta-Death Quick Time Events in general, because it's sometimes damn near impossible to know exactly when to push the Square/X/B button, the game only gives you about half a second to react, and each death counts against your score. They were so hated that they were basically removed from the sequel, largely replaced with climax style button mashes that <em>reward</em> quick reflexes, but don't necessarily punish missing them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ComixZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ComixZone">Comix Zone</a></em> had the rather infamous quirk that hitting inanimate objects removed a tiny sliver of your health bar...then <em>forced</em> you to break things this way to progress, unless you managed to figure out where every single hidden grenade or pack of dynamite is and use those instead.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Devil May Cry</a></em>:
<ul><li> There is not much love for the underwater sections in <em>Devil May Cry 1</em> or <em>2</em>. To elaborate, the first game had at least two first-person underwater sections. In these bits you controlled like a tank, can't use Devil Trigger, can only use the needle gun, and the enemies had way better movement than you did. It gets worse on Dante Must Die if you can't kill enemies fast enough. The second game had a lot of Lucia's missions underwater (in 3rd person this time) that played even worse, culminating in one of the missions having a boss battle that's underwater.
</li><li> What's that, player? You spent all of <em>Devil May Cry 3</em> getting used to the new Style mechanic, which was incredibly useful and allowed adaptability depending upon your personal play style? And you also quite like the Devil Trigger ability, which has been a part of the series since the first game, which is useful for a worst-case scenario or for dealing a bit of well-needed extra damage to a tough enemy or boss? Well then, I'll just remove <em>both</em> the Style and Devil Trigger mechanics around the halfway point of the fight against the penultimate boss, and if you don't like it, you can deal with it!
</li><li> The Devil Bringer Nero uses in <em>4</em> annoys some fans of the series in that it is overpowered and that combat becomes more of a one-hit <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWar">God of War</a></em> button pressing sequence rather than dishing out the combos... but the problem with Nero is that his move list is limited, and he doesn't get new weapons like Dante, thus to deal major damage you usually <em>have</em> to use the Devil Bringer.
</li><li> While revving Nero's sword up to power up his strikes has no downside and revving it in time with his attacks automatically powers up the next attack instead of having to rev it 3 times, it's a Scrappy Mechanic to a degree in case you're not a fan of hitting one of the shoulder buttons in time with every attack, especially since revved attacks have different timing and thus require you learn both of them if you wish to master EX-Acting and MAX-Acting all attacks. If you don't, your variety of attacks will be a lot more limited.
</li><li> Although gold orbs are nothing new to the DMC series, the fifth game's design unfortunately <em>showers</em> the player with the things, whether they want them or not. Since gold orbs let you instantly revive once downed - with full health, devil trigger, and magazine no less - and leave bosses still just as injured.... <em>and</em> can be used infinitely, even on Dante Must Die difficulty... the player always has the option of simply brute-forcing their way through any fight effortlessly, which blunts the sense of accomplishment from winning a difficult battle. The player doesn't have to use gold orbs, but it's more or less impossible to run out, and the alternative involves sitting through several loading screens to restart the mission.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DmCDevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DmCDevilMayCry">Dm C Devil May Cry</a></em>:
<ul><li> The removal of certain iconic moves such as taunting and, most importantly, a hard lock-on function. The latter makes the aim for guns, grapples and dash attacks a bit dodgy. This also makes dash attacks like Stinger harder to execute, as you have to tap the left stick in a direction twice instead of simply holding it towards the enemy you're locked on.
</li><li> Special weapons are split into two classes. Several enemy types are immune to one class or the other, which some players felt limited their weapon options in combat.
</li><li> The rating system rewards you for the damage you make rather than the variety from your combos, although the length of time a style grade remained before disappearing or lowering was significantly shortened in a patch.
</li><li> The Devil Trigger was significantly buffed, with some seeing it as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>, due its use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime">Bullet Time</a> and a tendency to throw any non-boss enemy helplessly into the air. Others dislike it because it only serves a single function instead of adding variety to combat like in the previous games in form of additional attacks and because filling the gauge to use it takes so long that you can only use it 1-2 times per level at most.
</li><li> The platforming sequences are sometimes seen as unnecessary or too easy, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">Padding</a> when replaying missions for points.
</li></ul></li><li> In the initial arcade release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoubleDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoubleDragon">Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone</a></em>, items in the in-game shops cost real world money. Complaints about this feature caused it to be later removed from the Japanese version.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors">Dynasty Warriors</a> 6</em>:
<ul><li> It introduced a new combat engine, Renbu (which means "Endless Dance"), which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">no longer limited attacks to a simple string of striking attacks as they could go on infinitely at any time</a> (Including the newly implemented string of charge attacks). As your Renbu level increased, more attacks (striking and charge) are added to your attack string. However, the only way to increase your Renbu level is by constantly attacking enemies (raising your chain counter), but that's not the worst of it. Your Renbu gauge can decrease by either not raising (or starting) your chain counter (Making this very frustrating in escort missions) or by taking heavy damage from enemy attacks.
</li><li> With the right abilities, renbu gague loss was mitigated. The real problem with renbu was that it was a fine idea on paper but not in play on higher difficulties. On higher difficulty levels, it's not uncommon for one of the fifteen or twenty mooks to hit you during a combo, breaking your momentum. Some characters could easily recover; but other characters' movesets (such as Dian Wei and Xiahou Dun) felt so uncomfortable to play with on higher difficulty settings that they were outright unusable.
</li><li> The reception for this was so bad Renbu was removed completely from the <em>Empires</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a> in favor of upgrading the weapons themselves to give more elaborate combos. Simplifying of the upgrade system is common for the <em>Empires</em> side games in order to allow more focus on the kingdom management aspects, but this is the first time a core battlefield mechanic was completely excised between a numbered release and the expansion.
</li><li> <em>Dynasty Warriors 2</em> had some enemy generals gaining powerups after standing back up from being knocked down. The battles were still winnable, but this <em>really</em> dragged some of them out, particularly when Liu Bei or Cao Cao was the commander. He could literally be the last man standing, with hostile forces <em>swarming</em> around him, and it'd still take 6 minutes to finish him off. No surprise Koei dropped this like a bad habit.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors">Hyrule Warriors</a></em>:
<ul><li> Any level where a Cucco will appear and follow the player around, as it seems to exist solely to discourage the use of wide attacks. Or, for that matter, any attacks if you don't know exactly where the chicken last moved to. The general consensus is that it's not a question of if you'll hit it enough to trigger its rage, but when. Some of the other Cucco events (guiding a baby Cucco to its mother and two Cuccos fighting in a keep) are also hated, but the one that follows the player is particularly hated.
</li><li> To a lesser extent, the missions that don't have an Element Affinity, as it means all the defense badges you've grinded for are now completely useless (making getting an A-Rank all that more difficult).
</li><li> During co-op play, enemy groups are severely cut to make up for the strain of having two characters in the same mission. This can make racking up KOs exceptionally difficult due to enemies not spawning fast enough; in fact, you could be only halfway through claiming a keep and have it completely devoid of enemies for several seconds. However, this <em>may</em> have been an intentional design flaw, since it discourages players from abusing co-op mode to A-Rank a mission with a character other than who the mission was intended for (although it <em>also</em> discourages playing the game with friends, as well).
</li><li> Some Ganon's Fury missions have Zant and Ghirahim show up and then get attacked, prompting you to save them. While the consequences of not saving them aren't particularly dire, this is made annoying by how Ganon's size is so vast that it is nearly impossible to make contact with their green circles to restore their health without pushing them into a wall first.

Only one of these is stored for later use when the player chooses, as it instantly kills all enemies on screen... but because it awards extra money for <em>not</em> using it when you beat the level, it's even scrappier, as most players simply leave it and take the money. The PS3 port, <em>Heroes' Paradise</em>, fixes this by having them stored automatically after the wheel is spun until the player activates them manually.

This card's reception, among others, led to Valve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">changing their policy on balance patches</a> and completely reworking the card, instead giving it the ability to grant a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastChanceHitPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastChanceHitPoint">Death Shield</a> to one unit per turn.
</li><li> The Flash web game <em>Clash of the Dragons</em> uses the combatant's deck as a life meter, depleting cards as they lose health. Several NPCs have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack">"Acid Flask"</a> card, which when depleted immediately deals interrupting, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnblockableAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnblockableAttack">unblockable damage</a> equal to the damage that caused it to be dealt. This means that if you deal 10 damage and have an Acid Flask as one of the depleted cards, you instantly take 10 damage. If you are reduced to 0 health by this, you immediately lose, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">regardless of how much damage you just caused to the enemy</a>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">RNG</a> effects. Between Arcane Missile-like spells not hitting the right targets, random-summon minions or spells giving you catastrophically detrimental minions (like Doomsayer or Darnassus Aspirant), Tavern Brawl which features some random effects such as random draw or random casting cost, etc, expect lots of rage. The Discard mechanic from Warlock is a prime example of this because of the inconsistency the mechanic presents.
</li><li> Silence is an ability that permanently removes all buffs and card text from a minion. The mechanic is incredibly unfun - it takes your minion and turns it into a lump of stats with no way to undo it. It's most commonly seen in Aggro decks, which use it to plow through strong Taunt minions and keeping Zerging down your hero. While it's rarely used in current sets, most of the Classic Silence cards still see play and only get more obnoxious as flashier effects are released.
</li><li> Inspire and Joust, the headline mechanics for The Grand Tournament set. Inspire is a triggered effect that activates when you use your Hero Power, and Joust reveals a card from each deck and gains a bonus if yours costs more. They were touted as ways to slow the meta. That failed. Both mechanics were pretty much doomed from the start - Inspire requires you to pump 2 extra mana to trigger the effect. Since it's repeatable, the Inspire can't be too powerful, and since the minion can be played on-curve without Inspiring it, it needs to be statted like its base mana cost. This created cards that can only be safely played two turns ahead of their stats, all for a mediocre effect. Joust has more potential, but Blizzard was apparently afraid of the effect, since the cards were all hopelessly terrible if the Joust failed. Since no deck could possibly build for a 100% Joust success, they didn't pan out either. While Joust actually has made a few scattered returns, Inspire was never brought back.
</li><li> Jade Golems, the signature mechanic for the Jade Lotus (Shamans, Rogues, and Druids) from Mean Streets of Gadgetzan. Every time you play a Jade card, you summon a Jade Golem. It starts as a 1/1, but makes each future Golem +1/+1 bigger. That sounds like a standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">Magikarp Power</a> mechanic, but it is <em>stupidly</em> easy to raise up. Each Jade card is above average on its own once you're at at least 3/3, meaning your deck is full of efficient cards that also summon a big minion. The worst offender is Jade Idol, a Druid card that lets you either summon a Jade Golem or shuffle three more Jade Idols into your deck. Your deck will never run out of cards, and late game you'll be drawing and playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">a larger and larger man</a> each turn. Worst of all, Jade Golems are parasitic, since they're pointless without other Jade support and require as much Jade as possible to work.

<ul><li> Super Block Meter. This mechanic charges by a variable amount and then blocks an attack, nullifying its damage. The main thing is that this mechanic is very well an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">RNG</a> mechanic, and it does indeed does its job in screwing you over and favoring your opponent. It can charge your block meter by 1 consecutively until you lose without even getting a chance to block, or your opponent can keep rolling 3 and eventually use all of their blocks on your powerful units.
</li><li> Untrickable is a trait that nullifies allies from the effects of traits. This trait incredibly screws you over thanks to the fact tricks does no effects to them and usually they are covered by another source that gives the allies Untrickable.
</li><li> Yes, the notorious "There is a problem with your game" and "Please check internet connection and try again" disconnect error messages during a ranked match. Not only do these cost a loss, but you get <em>absolutely no chance</em> to recover your internet or reconnect to the server should this happen. It's meant to discourage people from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit">Rage Quitting</a>, but the game can't tell if someone intentionally disconnected or just suffered a bad connection. It's also likely that EA didn't provide a server fallback mechanic and forces a loss of a star if you happen to disconnect. What's worse is that it has been repeatedly reported that this occurs even with strong Wi-Fi and cellular data and EA will refuse to provide any help for these losses and will completely blame it on your internet, strong or not. And to add on the insult, <strong>you still lose a star if this happens on the mulligan before the battle can even start!</strong>

While initially seen as fun, it rapidly became obvious that it was only fun for the Bilgewater player, as the pilfer cards were massively over-efficient, the requirement to trigger Plunder to get most of them to work properly ended up being absolutely trivial, and drawing your opponent's cards actually wasn't worse than drawing your own- it was usually <em>better</em> (even without deck synergy, nobody plays with <em>bad</em> cards, and you're depriving your opponent of resources they might desperately need). It regularly reached ridiculous levels in Bilgewater <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch">Mirror Matches</a> where one player would start pilfering their opponent's cards, only to steal all <em>their</em> pilfer cards and end up drawing half their deck (particularly as the Black Market Merchant not only pilfered a card, but reduced the cost of all stolen cards by 1 for each Merchant, which combined with the absurdly low cost of pilfer cards allowed them to go on doing it <em>for free</em>).

Although Count Dracula in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/MonsterBash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/MonsterBash">Monster Bash</a></em> and the buck in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/BigBuckHunterPro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/BigBuckHunterPro">Big Buck Hunter Pro</a></em> run on similar mechanisms, they both have hiding spots they would stay in until activated and would move back shortly afterwards.

In addition, fans of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a>, which this machine is aimed at, were confused why they were being asked to repeatedly whack Mick with the ball. This mechanic would gain the derisive nickname of "Mick on a Stick," and this machine's poor execution of it has effectively killed this mechanic.
</li><li> The upper playfield in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/PopeyeSavesTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/PopeyeSavesTheEarth">Popeye Saves the Earth</a></em> is placed right on top of the regular playfield and prevents you from seeing its entire top half. Though when new, the upper playfield's surface is transparent plastic and won't inhibit your vision much, once it gets enough play, the plastic will eventually become scratched up and opaque, rendering the upper half impossible to see.
</li><li> The Ring in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/WWEWrestlemania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/WWEWrestlemania">WWE Wrestlemania</a></em>, at least when the machine was first released, was a much-hated feature. There is nothing inherently annoying about a mini-playfield that simulates a wrestling ring, complete with rubber rings around the perimeter. What's annoying about it, however, is that the initial release's rules made it such that not only was the Ring always available, <em>every mode worth a lot of points</em> either began on the Ring or ended on the Ring, no exceptions. This meant that the more you spammed the Ring, the higher your score, and it made for terribly boring games. There was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">patch and an update released later that blocked off access to the Ring sometimes and created non-Ring modes</a>, but by then, the damage was already done, and the game was a total flop in sales and disliked by players of all skill levels.
</li><li> Every pinball machine that provides unlimited balls but only allows you to play until time runs out—<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/JamesBond007" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/JamesBond007">James Bond 007</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/FlipperFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/FlipperFootball">Flipper Football</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/SafeCracker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/SafeCracker">Safe Cracker</a></em>—have all bombed in sales and were unpopular with people passing by putting coins in to play. (A fourth one, <em>Goin' Nuts</em>, was scrapped before it could even be sold.) For all of these cases, the reason is the same: Newcomers get destroyed until they run out of time, whereas people dedicated to playing them well could learn to exploit time bonuses and play for way longer than it would remain interesting. <em>Safe Cracker</em> has since been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">Vindicated by History</a> when individuals bought used machines for personal use and they didn't have to worry about paying per game, however.
</li><li> Plunger lanes that lead to pop bumpers are a major cause of annoyance for a lot of players, especially if the pop bumpers do not have a fixed exit and can fly out in any direction. The reason is that there is a good chance that when you begin the ball, it goes to the bumpers and rockets into the drain, without any way of saving it. Even with a ball saver (a mechanic to return the ball to you with no penalty when the game begins), the ball could bounce around in the bumpers for so long that the ball saver runs out while the ball is still there. Machines where this has been an issue include <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/BramStokersDracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/BramStokersDracula">Bram Stoker's Dracula</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a></em> Most newer games to freeze timers even ball save when the ball is in the bumpers.
</li><li> Outlanes, particularly for beginners; it can seem unintuitive for the ball to slide into an outline, resulting in a drain that seems quite non-preventable. While experts argue that nudging the table can easily prevent an outlane drain, nudging requires knowing exactly when the ball is about to slam into the outlane as well as being delicate with the table; a nudge too weak is the same thing as doing nothing while a nudge too strong is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFairCheating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFairCheating">TILT</a>. However, some tables have "kickbacks" that will eject the ball from an outlane (usually the left one), or other means of catching balls that are about to head into either outlane (such as the Shooting Star in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/TalesOfTheArabianNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/TalesOfTheArabianNights">Tales of the Arabian Nights</a></em>); either way, anti-outlane measures often have limited activations so don't count on them saving you every time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkillShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkillShot">Skill Shots</a> involving flashing lanes at the back of the table are often dismissed for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck Shots</a> in practice; even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerSharpe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerSharpe">Roger Sharpe</a> admitted that his pinball-saving skill shot was a stroke of luck, i.e. he proved pinball wasn't about luck <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">through sheer luck</a></em> (pinball tables had been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedInChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedInChina">banned in some jurisdictions</a> on accusations of being gambling machines). Even other kinds of plunger-based skill shots can still fall under this trope depending on how well-maintained the plunger is. Perhaps because of this, some tables use flipper-based skill shots instead, where the player has to hit the ball into a designated target with the flippers immediately after launch.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoMode">Video Modes</a> are seen by some as interrupting the flow of a pinball game and being fairly out-of-place; after all, why play <em>pinball</em> and end up playing a <em>video game</em>? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatLawlor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatLawlor">Pat Lawlor</a>, among other pinball creators, is known for refusing to put video modes in his tables as a result.
</li><li> Starting in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>, several pinball games have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContextSensitiveButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContextSensitiveButton">Context-Sensitive Button</a> at the center of the lockdown bar at the front of the table. It can fall into this if it needs to be used while you're busy with the flippers: you have to take a hand off the flippers to slam the button and easily risk a drain, unless you're willing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UseYourHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UseYourHead">Use Your Head</a> or somehow have three arms. Particularly noticeable examples include <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/StarWarsStern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/StarWarsStern">Star Wars (Stern)</a></em> (where it toggles which shots are affected by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoreMultiplier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoreMultiplier">Score Multipliers</a>, necessitating frequently using it during gameplay in order to maximize points), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/BlackKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/BlackKnight">Black Knight</a>: Sword of Rage</em> (where it controls the Magna-Save, meaning that a feature that often requires quick reflexes to properly utilize now has a second-long delay caused by the need to move your hand), and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanJerseyJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanJerseyJack">Pirates of the Caribbean (Jersey Jack)</a></em> (where it collects gold whenever it's available, requiring constant attention to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtonMashing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtonMashing">button mash</a> and make the most of the short window of opportunity).

<ul><li> The self-disabling panels. Many panels in the game are connected via wires that indicate the power flowing from one to another. A lot of these panels disable themselves when a wrong solution is entered, forcing you to return to the previous panel and reenter the correct solution. Theoretically, this serves to discourage the player from brute forcing puzzles, but there are two problems with this. The first is that this feature appears in more complex puzzles that have many possible solutions and are therefore unlikely to be brute forced; the self-disablement here just serves to unnecessarily punish players for making a mistake. The second is that with some of these puzzles, the previous panel still shows the right solution, making it easy to reenter; the self-disablement here doesn't discourage brute force so much as slightly prolong it.
</li><li> The desert puzzles revolve around reflection of light on the panels to reveal the correct paths drawn on them. The basement of the desert temple contains puzzles based on water reflection — the principle is the same, but this time you have to arrange the water level of a pool below the panels to reflect at the right angles to see the solutions. While this puzzle is hard enough since the water reflects the solutions upside-down, the really annoying thing is that the water cannot be paused between its highest and lowest points; if you don't get the solution, you'll have to wait for the pool level to rise or lower completely before you can try again. This is especially bad because the speed at which the water level changes is super slow.

The developers have stated that it was an artistic decision, with the idea being you are eavesdropping on conversations, so it was a challenge put in place by having the audio muffled and no subtitles displayed. Unfortunately, with the only available language being English, it pretty much locks that content for non-English speakers. And that the lack of subtitles locks out anyone with impaired hearing, or with auditory-processing difficulties that are somewhat commonplace on the autistic spectrum.

It only increased your max lives from five to eight, and regaining a single life <em>still</em> took 30 minutes.</span> Unlocking later levels costs money too. 30 cents isn't too bad, though.
</li><li> The Conveyor Belts, introduced in Sticky Savannah, are annoying and tricky, and the levels that usually feature them are littered with bombs that are hard enough to get rid of. And what's worse? The Bombs will explode before the Conveyor Belt moves—meaning that <em>if</em> the Bombs were to possibly be taken out by luck of the Conveyor Belt, it wouldn't happen. Not as hated as the Toffee Tornado, but still an annoying obstacle.
</li><li> The moon scale in the Dreamworld levels. It forces you to get two different candy colours in equal quantities, or else you'll fail the level. It's entirely possible for a single unrelated combo to rapidly make several chains of one of them, resulting in Odus falling off and you losing the level due to pure dumb luck. The unpopularity of this mechanic may have contributed to the Dreamworld being discontinued in May 2015 and removed altogether two years later.
</li><li> Despite only appearing in 27 levels in Reality and 18 in Dreamworld, Toffee Tornadoes were one of the most hated blockers in the game. In their original form, they couldn't be matched with anything, couldn't be removed — not even temporarily — in <em>any</em> way, moved to another random tile and destroyed the candy on it after each move, and left its original tile cracked (thus useless) for a move. They essentially only existed to screw you over by randomly denying you the chance to make certain matches, and made certain levels almost impossible unless you got very lucky. It didn't help that the candies they destroyed affected the moon scale in the web version of the game. Even <em>three</em> nerfs to make them more tolerable couldn't rescue them from the scrappy heap, and they were eventually removed entirely from the standard game with pretty much no one mourning them.

<ul><li> Eliminator mode in the various games is almost universally imbalanced, requiring mostly luck to get the right weapons and not so much player skill. The weapons were balanced for regular racing, so many didn't even do damage or very little, and some were grossly overpowered in a game mode where you didn't have to bother with speed. <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wip3out" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wip3out">Wip3out</a> was the worst offender since almost nothing did any noticable damage except for Energy Drain and Plasma Bolt, both a one-hit kill. It got better in later titles, but then participating in this mode became required to beat the game.
</li><li> Shooting a competing ship in the first <em>Wipeout</em> game would cause it to stall and you to crash into it. This was changed in the sequel so that shooting a ship would flip it up, enabling you to pass underneath. The frustration factor was cranked up again in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sequelitis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sequelitis">degraded sequel</a> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wip3out" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wip3out">Wip3out</a></em> which reduced the flip duration so you would probably collide with the target anyway unless you fired at point blank range. And on a killing blow the disintegrating ship would stay at ground level and grind to a halt, bringing you to a very frustrating stop if you were unable to move out of the way quickly. And there was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeKindOfForceField" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeKindOfForceField">Force Wall</a> weapon which covered half of the track ahead of you and bounced opponents backwards... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinballProjectile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinballProjectile">in your face</a>, catapulting you back at high speed. Add to this the chance to blow yourself up if the target deployed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">last second</a> Reflector and it becomes clear that using weapons on opponents you don't particularly care about (ie. everyone but the opponent in first place) was more likely to hurt you than to help you.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InitialDArcadeStage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InitialDArcadeStage">Initial D Arcade Stage</a> 4</em> sets arbitrary "speed limits" on turns. If you go over this speed limit, depending on whether you're playing version 1.2 or 1.5, then either your steering will lock up, causing you to crash into the outer wall unless you execute a "brake cancel" technique, or you will oversteer like hell. And if you hit a wall or suffer said understeer, your acceleration is permanently gimped and can only be fixed with brake cancelling. Which is done on a <em>straightaway</em>. But that's not where the problems end. To get to the tuning shop, you have to eject your card three times. Not continue three times, you have to pick "NO" at the continue screen for it to count. This means that if you're playing several rounds in a row, then you'll be wasting chances to tune up your car if you continue each time—you have to spend about 2-3 minutes between sessions ejecting your card, putting it back in, and going through all the menus. These sorts of mechanics are contributing to the downfall of the IDAS scene.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BurnoutRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BurnoutRevenge">Burnout Revenge</a></em> gave us "Traffic Checking". The idea being that your car can shunt small vehicles that are stationary/going the same way you are, out of the way. The problem however was that this also gave you boost. Normally boost was rewarded for risky driving, but Traffic Checking had no risk attached to it, unless you couldn't tell the back of a car from the back of a bus. Then some of that traffic would happen to bump into your rivals, whether you were trying to do that or not, rewarding you with even more boost. Naturally, smart players would change their strategy from trying to stay in oncoming where possible, to driving going the right way and shunting cars about in the process.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SegaSuperstars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SegaSuperstars">Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing</a></em> allows the race leader to get Missiles, which act like the Red Shell in the Mario Kart Series (homing attack against the racer ahead). However, not only are the missiles far more precise, when the leader gets one, he can shoot it backwards and it will lock on the second racer! That means if you are trying to reach the leader, you'll have to focus on the hazards of the track, avoid the mines dropped by the leader and pray that, if he gets a missile, the next item box gives you a shield, a KO Glove, or another missile. Oh, the leader will also get Speed Shoes every now and then.
</li><li> <em>R4: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RidgeRacer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RidgeRacer">Ridge Racer</a> Type 4</em> gives you new cars during GP Mode, the cars you get depending on your performance in the last few races. If you place first in every race, you'll get the best cars for your team/sponsor combo, but winning every race in 1st only unlocks a fraction of the cars. To unlock the rest, you have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWellButNotPerfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWellButNotPerfect">Do Well, but Not Perfect</a> and place 2nd or 3rd to unlock the lower-tier cars, which is annoying because it means sandbagging races as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellPlayer">getting some pretty disparaging remarks from your team for not finishing in first</a>.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rollcage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rollcage">Rollcage</a></em> Leader Missile would sometimes lock on to buildings (instead of opponents) and bring them down on your own head.

</li><li> Having to play 60, 80, or 100 credits of Story Mode for a full tune is reviled by players of all experience levels.

</li><li> A minor example for North American players of <em>Maximum Tune 5</em>: The North America superregion only has one region available: United States, unlike the Japan version (which uses the prefectures of Japan) or the Asia version (which uses countries, of which multiple are listed). This makes all region-based indicators and features (such as the "Select by region" option in Ghost Battle mode) rather redundant. Also, even if you play in Canada, your region is still listed as "USA".

Given that many powersliding techniques rely on shifting down two or three gears at once (and in fact many console ports allow the player to assign buttons for each gear), this is basically a screw-you to well-versed <em>Daytona USA</em> players.

If you're a native English speaker, you won't have any problems with it, because it's well implemented and reliable... but outside of the English speaking world, people tend to pronounce it as something more like "Neetroh!", and become frustrated as the nitro refuses to engage because they're not correctly pronouncing the word in proper English.

For one, a number of spells go through spell immunity for no reason other than the limited <em>Warcraft 3</em> engine on which the original <em>Dota</em> is built. This flaw was faithfully ported to the standalone sequel and is frustrating to be on the receiving end of.
<ul><li> In <em>Dota 2</em>, there are runes that spawn randomly in two spots every 2 minutes. This includes right at the start of the match. Guessing correctly and getting a free double damage or illusion rune before the game even starts is somewhat annoying for the enemy. On the other hand, proper teams tend to ward and prepare for the rune spawns, so acquiring the rune is less 'guessing' and more 'preparation'.
</li><li> A mechanic held over from the first <em>Dota</em> is gold loss upon death.

</li></ul></li><li> As a <em>rule of thumb</em>, if an RTS game includes a naval component (that is, separate from its usual land/air/space battles), it will probably be this. From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpires" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpires">Age of Empires</a></em> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer">Command &amp; Conquer</a></em> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfNations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfNations">Rise of Nations</a></em> and everything in between, much like in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformGame">platform games</a>, something about taking to the high seas just spells doom for the players' enjoyment and many players just wind up excluding it from their gameplay whenever possible.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9tzaf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9tzaf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9tzaf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">If you want exceptions, then both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalAnnihilation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalAnnihilation">Total Annihilation</a></em> and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SupremeCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SupremeCommander">Supreme Commander</a></em> have well-received naval combat- in fact, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplacentGamingSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplacentGamingSyndrome">most popular 4v4 map</a> in the latter, Seton's Clutch, is almost half water with only a narrow land bridge joining the two halves of the map in the centre.</span> There's a number of reasons for why this might be, but two of the most common:
<ul><li> There's usually little interaction between the Naval component of a battle, and any other part of it, so if you should choose to do both, you're basically fighting two unrelated battles simultaneously, which might or might not be operating under different rules. After all, ground troops can't very well waltz into the sea, and your ships certainly won't get anywhere trying to cross the land. And if you should win the battle at sea and advance inland with your ground forces, your ships, unable to go aground themselves, will have no choice but to remain on the water twiddling their thumbs. Some games alleviate this by giving navies the ability to do things like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">bombard the shore from long range with cannons or aircraft carriers once you've cleared the water of things that can kill them.</a> But this leads to...
</li><li> It's usually somewhere between difficult and <em>impossible</em> to mount an offense against an opponent's navy unless you have a navy yourself. Best case scenario is you can deploy a land-based, long-range weapon that can force enemy ships to keep their distance from land, but that's as far as you'll get. After all, if you try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyFastConstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyFastConstruction">whip up some docks and push out your own ships,</a> the enemy navy with its numerical superiority and positional advantage will pound your fledgling fleet into dust before it can even push out of the drydock. If the sea is the only way for you to advance on your opponent, this naturally leads to an unpleasant stalemate at best.

<ul><li> In the first game, the crush glitch was this: whenever an enemy of considerable bulk was defeated, it could sometimes kill Pikmin by falling on top of them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin2">Pikmin 2</a></em>, the crush glitch was fixed. But a Scrappy Mechanic from the original game that was not fixed was the nectar drops: it made as many Pikmin who drank it instantly mature into flowers (increased agility and strength), but it was possible for <em>one</em> Pikmin to drink up the entire drop.

<ul><li> The Open Rebellion event for <em>Stellar Phenomena.</em> If allegiance drops to less than 30% on planets, a sizable fleet of rebels, complete with their own Capital Ships, will attack the planet, destroy everything they can, and automatically destroy the colony regardless of health upgrades. Since planets more than 5 phase lanes away have a maximum of 35% loyalty, and Deliverance Engine signals guarantee at least a 10% drop, playing against an Advent player is an exercise in futility as the colonies are overthrown faster than you can restore them. Not even TEC Rebels, who are "assaulted" by fleets of non-combative forces, are immune to this.
</li><li> Culture can be this. You may be doing well militarily only to have your planets slip from your control. Especially bad if you're doing a military research only run for the Achievements or don't have enough slots to spare for Broadcast Centres.
</li><li> The Pirates. They steal credits from players they attack, become stronger over time, and as of the <em>Outlaw Sector</em> DLC, their base is absurdly well fortified, and will attack multiple players at once, so not even paying higher bounties against other players will save you. Players often choose to simply turn off the pirates option.

</li><li> Unlike <em>Rome</em>, there is no way to change your Faction Heir in this game. Presumably it was done for historical accuracy, with the computer typically selecting the oldest son of your Faction Leader if one is available. (If not, his next oldest brother is typically chosen.) This can lead to scenarios where a greedy/corrupt/disloyal governor of a backwater territory is named heir over his much more qualified brother/cousin who is a loyal conquering general. Your only option at that point is to send your undesired heir off to battle as part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit">Uriah Gambit</a> (and hope against it turning into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler">Springtime for Hitler</a> situation where surviving makes him even harder to kill in the future.)

Basically, once your clan controls about 15 provinces (out of 65,) <em>every other clan</em> will ally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangUpOnTheHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangUpOnTheHuman">against you</a>. You're given a severe diplomatic penalty, meaning your former allies will abandon you and you'll be unable to establish trade relations, killing your economy. Finally, every clan that is against you will be given large stacks of veteran units every turn, even if they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">can't realisticaly afford to recruit them or pay their upkeep</a>.

For example, Dwarfs would never be caught dead away from their mountain fortresses, and humans don't much fancy living in them, so one could never occupy territory of the other's type. This tended to leave holes on your borders you could never permanently plug. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarWarhammerII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarWarhammerII">The sequel</a> addressed this with a more nuanced "habitability" concept, which imposed development and public order penalties for trying to maintain settlements in unfriendly climates.

<ul><li> In <em>Warcraft: Orcs and Humans</em>, you could not create new Town Halls at other locations. This made it difficult to mine gold that was far away from your Tonw Hall. Subsequent games would allow you to build new Town Halls at other locations (and in the third game, one faction can turn their Town Hall into a mobile unit and back).
</li><li> Also from <em>Warcraft: Orcs and Humans</em> was the road mechanic, which restricted where you could build structures. As nobody liked it, it never appeared again.
</li><li> Units only had maximum sight when they were not moving, which made scouting very tedious.
</li><li> <em>Warcraft II</em> had absurdly pathetic sight range for most units, which made scouting horrendous if you didn't have a Flying Machine/Zeppelin in your army.
</li><li> <em>Warcraft III</em> had upkeep. If your forces got big enough, 30% of any gold you gain from that point is lost. If it gets bigger, you lose a whopping 60% of gold that is brought in. Considering that gold is limited...
</li><li> Also from <em>Warcraft III</em> is that the AI will focus on attacking weaker units before stronger ones, which can be particularly annoying for the factions that have weaker ranged units compared to the melee units on the front line.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PlagueInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PlagueInc">Plague Inc.</a></em> contained an extremely satisfying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> known as the Trojan Planes perk, that would cause infectees of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite">Neurax Worm</a> to land planes in closed-off countries: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosLaughingNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosLaughingNow">who's laughing NOW, Madagascar</a>?

Even late-game player empires can become little more than target practice, and the rewards for winning one aren't really worth it.

It's exactly what you'd expect to happen when incorporating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart">Mario Kart</a>-esque powerups into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhythmGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhythmGame">Rhythm Game</a>: The AI opponents play <em>flawlessly</em>, and depending on the player, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizophrenicDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizophrenicDifficulty">the difficulty of the matches</a> ranges from trivial to absolutely impossible, thanks to being almost completely dependent on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">getting the right powerups</a> and using them at the right time, and if the AI can do the same to you. It should already be telling that the first guitar duel is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">said to be the hardest</a>, simply because your opponent's notechart simply doesn't have enough consecutive notes for you to reliably defeat him with anything but a specific powerup. This is probably why <em>World Tour</em> reworked the duels (your opponent still plays flawlessly, but gains multiplier at a much slower rate and is capped at 3x, and power-ups are gone, so the objective is simply having a higher score than your opponent) and completely removed from the campaign in later titles.
</li><li> The Whammy Bar is annoying to players and observers alike. Not only is it required to max out points on some songs (darn that Star Power meter), but it ruins notes that were never meant to be whammied. That, and you have to take your hand off the strum bar to use it, so on shorter notes or staggered chords, it can be a nightmare.
</li></ul></li><li> The PS1 port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution">Dance Dance Revolution</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">1st Mix</a> brings us <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangeMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangeMode">Arrange Mode</a>, which is essentially the same as normal mode, with one key difference: if you step on a panel when you aren't supposed to, instead of nothing happening, you instead get an "OUCH!!" judgment, which drains your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeMeter">Life Meter</a> even moreso than a Miss. So if you have a crappy pad, or you like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">freestyling</a>, or you step on panels when nothing's happening to keep the beat...
<ul><li> DDR X introduces <em>shock arrows</em>; if your foot is down when they reach the target zone, your combo breaks, your health takes a hit, and the whole chart goes invisible for about a second. Even worse is how they're placed: while mines in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InTheGroove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InTheGroove">In the Groove</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PumpItUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PumpItUp">Pump It Up Pro</a> // <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StepMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StepMania">StepMania</a> can be placed in one or two columns at a time if one wishes, shock arows ALWAYS fill all of the columns. This means you'll have to jump completely off the pad every time they come. And you'll be doing a LOT of said jumping, especially in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbqFfL6svo">"Horatio"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. They come back in X2, where every Challenge chart to contain them is <strong>EXACTLY THE SAME</strong> as Expert, only with the shock arrows replacing certain steps.
</li><li> Even as of the current game, you're still required to pay double price just to play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoublePlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoublePlay">Double Play</a>, a mode in which one player uses both sets of panels, unless the "joint premium" setting is switched on. In contrast, <em>beatmania IIDX</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PumpItUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PumpItUp">Pump It Up</a></em> not only allow double modes on a single credit, but will even let you switch between single and double between songs.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>DDR</em> is pretty merciful with its doubles charts, never requiring the player to make jumps with the arrows more than ~2.2 cells apart. No such mercy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PumpItUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PumpItUp">Pump It Up</a></em>, where at its highest levels, the game expects you to be able to do "stretch" jumps and rolls (patterns that require hitting quickly or simultaneously hitting panels on extreme opposite ends of the stage, such as 1P's ↙ and 2P's ↘). Risking intense muscle pain just to make these jumps is not fun.
<ul><li> And as if that wasn't bad enough, <em>Pump It Up</em> also introduced the concept of <em>three</em> pad chords, requiring you to -you guessed it- slap a third pad with your hand while executing a jump onto two more, or slapping a pad while maintaining a 2-pad hold note. These would not only throw you off-balance and be difficult to time, you'd likely hurt your palms on the hard surface of the pads, which are after all designed to be <em>stamped</em> on.
</li></ul></li><li> Minigames in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Patapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Patapon">Patapon</a></em> series. The main gameplay uses player-entered rhythm based musical sequences that call for a variety of attacks, and then <em>every single</em> minigame is a call-repeat rhythm game that uses a single button (or TWO for a minigame in <em>Patapon 2</em>). These minigames are sometimes the only way to get top level weapons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OsuTatakaeOuendan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OsuTatakaeOuendan">Osu! Tatakae!

<ul><li> Spinners are what set the dedicated players apart. Partway or at the very end of a song, you're meant to stop tapping beats and instead draw really fast circles on your DS screen while a timer counts down. Do well and you'll gain tons of bonus points - do poorly and you'll lose a sizable portion of your health meter. Towards the end of the harder difficulties, the spinners get so demanding that no matter how flawless a player's rhythm is, they'll live or die based solely on the dexterity of their wrist. Naturally, those who fail to meet the expectations of the later spinners will quickly grow to hate them since they alone make the final songs near-unbeatable or at least impossible to score a Perfect on, putting the higher ranks out of reach.
</li><li> The scoring system is pretty frustrating. Each note has a base value of up to 300 points, depending on how well you time the note. Seems pretty standard for a rhythm game. Then comes the combo multiplier; by the end of the song, a single note can be worth tens of thousands of points. In other rhythm games, missing a note simply means you lose a few points. Here, missing just one note will completely botch your score, especially if said miss is in the middle of the song. Mercifully, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayGrading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayGrading">Gameplay Grading</a> system is strictly based on note accuracy, but it leads to situations where an A-ranked run scores much, much higher than an S-ranked run.
</li><li> And if you're playing the popular OTO/EBA clone <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Osu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Osu">osu!</a></em>, you get all of the above, plus multipliers for using modifiers as well. One particular modifier speeds up the song by 50%. This means to obtain a top-tier score on a song, you not only need to not miss a single note <em>ever</em>, you also need to increase the song speed, which makes the chart much more difficult and will probably make the song sound terrible.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeMeter">Life Meter</a> continuously drains, making the <em>Ouendan</em> series some of the few rhythm games where you can fail a song <em>in the middle of a combo.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DJMAX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DJMAX">DJMAX</a> Technika's</em> unlock system. On completing certain missions in Platinum Crew mode, you'll unlock a song (or in the case of one mission, a course)...but you can only use that unlocked song or course 3 times before you have to unlock it again. Thankfully, this is being revised for <em>Technika 2</em> where you gain unlocks by simply going onto the Platinum Crew website and purchasing the unlocks once using your in-game currency. The one flipside to this is that unlocks are fairly expensive, especially for the more difficult songs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Beatmania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Beatmania">BeatmaniaIIDX</a> 17 Sirius</em>:
<ul><li> Backspin Scratches, in which you continously spin the turntable in one direction until the end of the note, then spin it the other way at the very end. It's awkward to keep spinning the turntable, and even moreso to spin it back at the end, especially if there are key notes between the start and the end of the scratching.
</li></ul></li><li> Directional scratch notes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DJHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DJHero">DJ Hero</a></em>. If you get many of these in a row, you'll need to press the button, spin the turntable controller in the correct direction for a <em>very</em> short amount of time, <em>stop spinning</em>, and repeat. Needless to say, doing this many times in quick succession can be physically painful.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand">Rock Band</a></em>:
<ul><li> A bug in drumming called "squeezing", which is a scrappy for those anal about the scoring. If you hit the crash on a fill a little early, and then in the next split-second hit what would have been there if the fill wasn't in the way, you get the points for hitting those notes. This means you have to memorize what to hit and finish fills a little awkwardly for extra points. Usually not enough to make a difference unless both players are doing perfect, but can cause a rift between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scrub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scrub">Scrubs</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopHavingFunGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopHavingFunGuys">"Stop Having Fun" Guys</a>. Singing has a different version of squeezing; in some cases, for the absolute maximum points, you need to hit overdrive exactly as the overdrive zone ends, as opposed to doing so in the middle of the zone. If you're too late though, you'll fall out of the zone and not trigger overdrive at all, and the optimal point isn't on rhythm. This also encourages using the select button instead of shouting for overdrive, since it's more precise. Similarly, arrhythmic overdrive timing also applies to guitar\bass\keyboards, same as <em>Guitar Hero</em>.
</li><li> Drum fills in general are slightly controversial among <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand">Rock Band</a> players, in that choosing not to trigger Overdrive can allow drummers to coast through parts of songs that might otherwise prove deviously hard. It does hurt your score to do this though, and it's basically a useless strategy in Rock Band 3, where no-fail mode does not disqualify.
</li><li> The two DS Rock Band games and the only on PSP share an annoyance that is sure to ruin your gameplay experience: You are required to switch tracks to play as different instruments at the end of every chain. Thankfully the games are more generous in difficulty, but the game often forgets to signal you to PREPARE for a solo. Expect failing a Full Combo only because a surprise Guitar Solo brought you from drum to guitar track INSTANTLY.

<ul><li> In the first game, scoring is greatly increased during a single section of each song called Chance time. A single perfect hit normally awards 500 points, with up to 250 points of combo bonus. In Chance Time, the combo bonus raises 20 times faster and caps 5000 points higher, meaning a single Chance Time commonly awards more points than the entire rest of the song, despite being less than twenty seconds long. This meant that unless you are gunning for a perfect score, 90% of the game is almost completely irrelevant. Perhaps the sheer weight of Chance Time sections are why they're absent from the <em>Project DIVA Arcade</em> and <em>Project Mirai</em> games.
</li><li> It works in reverse, too. There are some songs that are scored so harshly that missing even one note in chance time guarantees a rank of STANDARD. Frustrating if you're trying to unlock the extra models.
</li><li> The timing windows in both games in general are fairly harsh by typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhythmGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhythmGame">Rhythm Game</a> standards. This is compounded by any judgment below FINE (the second highest out of 5 possible note judgments) being a combo break; compare to <em>IIDX</em> where a GOOD (the 3rd highest out of 5 judgments) will maintain a combo, or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution">Dance Dance Revolution</a></em> where a GOOD (again, 3rd highest) will break a combo but the timing windows are looser. This wouldn't be much of a problem for those just wanting to beat songs, but you are required to hit a certain percentage of notes with combo-maintaining judgments to clear the song (80% in <em>Diva 2nd</em>, varying depending on difficulty level in <em>Diva Arcade</em>) on top of keeping your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeMeter">Life Meter</a> above 0 during the song.

What's wrong with them? To start, the max character length for a comment is 16 like in many other 3DS game contexts; fine for Japanese, not so much for Western languages, not helped by the fact that Western-region 3DSes don't allow Japanese script input. Additionally, you can only send one comment at a time via the above methods, which means if you have any multi-comment gimmicks set up in any songs, those are going to get ruined when sent to other players.

<ul><li> <em>jubeat saucer</em> was infamous for its "song swap" system; every month through updates carried out via Konami's e-Amusement network, some songs were cut out while other songs are introduced or revived; this mechanic made many players unhappy, and was a source of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">memes</a> for some players. This made it the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BEMANI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BEMANI">BEMANI</a> game to delete songs through online updates. However, as of February 1, 2014, almost all previously-removed songs<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note107u2e');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note107u2e" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note107u2e');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">licensed songs that were removed at the start of <em>jubeat saucer</em> and were not revived later are still gone</span> have been revived, and song swap DID NOT come back in <em>jubeat saucer fulfill</em>.
</li><li> The rating scale over time has become less and less useful, due to the wide range of challenge present amongst level 10 charts. The fact that two songs have level 10 charts on <em>Advanced</em> and one song, "Megalara Garuda", has level 10 charts on Advanced and <strong>BASIC</strong>, shows that the rating scale is effectively obsolete amongst top-end players.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>O2Jam</em>:
<ul><li> The same speed mod is applied to all players in a multiplayer room. This is a huge problem for players who have different preferences in speed modifiers for the same song.
</li><li> Several level up missions require the usage of modifiers such as Hidden and Sudden to complete. However—and this is where the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Freemium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Freemium">Freemium</a> aspect rears its ugly head—modifiers come in the form of "rings" that each only last for one song and must be purchased with in-game currency that is bought with real money, which is unfair to players who don't have a way to purchase rings. The problem can be mitigated somewhat in that the player does not need the ring themselves; if they are in a room hosted by another player, one who has the necessary ring, they can still complete the mission without having to pony up cash.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LoveLiveSchoolIdolFestival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LoveLiveSchoolIdolFestival">Love Live! School Idol Festival</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game is infamous among <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhythmGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhythmGame">Rhythm Game</a> players for the way scoring is handled: Instead of being based strictly on what goes on within the current song, the player's score is also based on their team's Attributes, which influence points per note, and Skills, which can do things like randomly add points or loosen the timing windows every <em>x</em> seconds, combo, notes, or Perfects. Many new players get frustrated getting all Perfects on the first few songs yet still getting C ranks because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell">their starting teams are complete garbage compared to what they can eventually assemble</a>; to have a non-zero chance at getting the coveted S rank, one will need to scout out SR- and UR-rarity members and then level them up through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">Prac</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallAHitPointASmeerp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallAHitPointASmeerp">tice</a>, a mechanic usually reserved for RPGs that don't try to pass themselves off as competition-viable games. While some players argue that the player still needs to hit notes accurately and string combos to gain points, there is also the counterargument that the Attribute system still caps the player's maximum score and by extension rank. As a result, many players who want to truly play competitively instead go off judgement counts and ignore everything else.
</li><li> Related to the above, the fact that the game offers absolutely no reward for obtaining an all-Perfect performance — not even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticAward">Cosmetic Award</a>, unlike most rhythm games where a perfect play is feasible — means there's just no point in trying to do it, and even if you do decide to go for such runs, you'll have to manually keep track of them due to score not being necessarily indicative of performance.
</li><li> Songs in the Hits folder require you to clear the Easy chart to unlock the Normal chart and the Normal Chart to unlock the Hard chart. For rhythm game beginners, this is not a problem, but those who "immigrate" from other rhythm games may find this as an example of video game "hand-holding". Fortunately, songs in the B-Sides folder don't have this requirement; all you need is the necessary LP. Which in turn leads to <em>another</em> Scrappy Mechanic...
</li><li> The harder a chart is, the more LP you need to play it. The idea is to prevent players from recklessly taking risks; on the other hand, you'll most likely need far more practice on an Expert chart than an Easy chart. Because of this, failing something like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">"Soldier Game" on Expert</a> can be incredibly frustrating, because it takes a lot of grinding to have the LP capacity to try it more than once in a row.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14rvj');"><sup>To elaborate on that specific example... </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note14rvj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14rvj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Expert charts in the B-Sides folder take 25 LP per attempt. You recover one LP every six minutes, or ten every hour. Therefore each attempt costs <em>two and a half hours</em> worth of LP. Alternatively you can use a Love Gem to instantly recharge stamina, but Love Gems are difficult to grind unless you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">pay for them</a> and you might prefer to save them for Honor Scouting instead.</span>
</li><li> For some players, Events are this. Score Matches have you competing against other players in hopes of not getting last place and therefore getting Event point bonuses. School Idol Diary events have you farming tokens for Event songs, which you then play for Event points. Every few hundred or thousand Event points, you get rewards such as Love Gems and Coins, with an SR card as one of the highest rewards. However, this SR card comes non-Idolized. To get a second SR card so you can Idolize it, you need to finish the event with a high enough ranking percentile, which means grinding more points than a large percentage of other players. And considering that this is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedlyFreeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedlyFreeGame">"free-to-play" mobile game</a>, this means that to stay competitive, one needs to play <em>constantly</em>, practically every waking hour, and maybe even sink <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">Love Gems</a> to refill Stamina and keep grinding. As a result, many players who want to get their Idolized SR rewards end up burning away large chunks of time from their daily lives and money just to stay in the top percentiles to get two of that particular card, often burning out on the game in the process.
</li></ul></li><li> Combine the issue with timing judgements and combo breaking in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HatsuneMikuProjectDiva" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HatsuneMikuProjectDiva">Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA</a></em> and scoring dependence of characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LoveLiveSchoolIdolFestival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LoveLiveSchoolIdolFestival">Love Live!

This is mitigated by the fact that charisma restores more quickly than most rhythm games <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11s105');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11s105" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11s105');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> 1 per minute, the fastest restoring rate of all rhythm games </span>and all difficulties are accessible right from the start.
</li><li> <em>Most</em>, if not <em>all</em> mobile rhythm games with playable human characters will have the issue of the characters' attributes and levels influencing grading and scoring more heavily than the player's skill, which is handled differently from game to game. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LoveLiveSchoolIdolFestival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LoveLiveSchoolIdolFestival">Love Live! School Idol Festival</a></em>, despite what has been stated above, is not <em>the worst</em> example of this. For example, in the defunct mobile game <em>IDOL-RISM</em>, playing songs in difficulties above normal require high ranked and leveled characters to even <em>pass</em> them as having too low of a score results in failure regardless of your actual performance.
</li><li> In most rhythm games, getting a "perfect" rating simply requires you to clear the stage with a perfect score. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RhythmHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RhythmHeaven">Rhythm Heaven</a></em>, however, you can't just pick a minigame and flawlessly perform it; instead, you have to wait for the game to offer a "Go for a Perfect!" challenge on a randomly-selected minigame, and <em>then</em> attempt that minigame and perfect it. And you only get three chances; not only can you lose a chance by missing (which by the way results in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare">Jump Scare</a> screech sound), but you also lose one if you quit out of the minigame in mid-attempt or play another minigame altogether. If you lose all of your chances, you'll need to play other games until the next time the game offers a Perfect challenge, which will be another minigame that you haven't gotten a Perfect on yet. The pain comes not just from trying to play perfectly, but also doing so under the intense pressure of having limited opportunities. The one saving grace is that if you got the medal for every single minigame (and thus have nothing left but to get all perfects), you will always have a "Go for a Perfect!" available.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrooveCoaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrooveCoaster">Groove Coaster</a></em>:
<ul><li> In many rhythm games with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Harder Than Hard</a> difficulty available, you simply need to fulfill certain conditions on the difficulty below it to unlock it for the song you want. Not so in the arcade version of <em>GC</em>; to unlock a song's Extra chart, you have to not only get an S rank on the Hard chart, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeLongevity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeLongevity">but also on Simple and Normal</a> despite having demonstrated that you're good enough for Extra and too good for anything below Hard.
</li><li> Are you playing the game in the United States? Enjoy your ripoff prices! The only arcades in the US that carry <em>Groove Coaster</em> are Round 1 locations. Whereas most rhythm games at Round 1 that also use 2-minute cuts of songs cost 6 credits (1.50 USD before bulk-purchase and loyalty discounts) for 3 stages, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Round 1 corporate</a> dictates that all Round 1 branches in the US must set <em>Groove Coaster</em> to 6 credits for <strong>2</strong> stages. And just to add insult to injury, the US is the <em>only</em> country where <em>Groove Coaster</em> is typically set to two stages; everywhere on the Asia Pacific, the game offers 3 stages per credit no matter the price (for comparison, 100 JPY for 3 stages is the standard in Japan). In spite of griping about this from players and said players refusing to play, <em>nothing</em> has been done at the corporate level to address this (not helped by there being no way for non-employees to contact Round 1's corporate offices), meaning that if you want to play at a more reasonable price, you have only two options: play in Event Mode if it's available and be limited to a small pool of songs, or outright leave the country.
</li><li> <em>Groove Coaster 4</em> locks out the last 1/3 of the difficulty scale with a "Get an S rank in a chart of this difficulty minus one to unlock this difficulty level" system (for example, get an S on a level 10 chart to unlock level 11, get an S on a level 11 chart to unlock level 12, etc.). This leads to a lot of problems where you can be capable of clearing charts of one level, but you can't play that level because you can't get the 900,000 points necessary on any chart in the level below it (and it doesn't help that you can easily botch that requirement because of chain bonus; one miss can easily make you lose 50,000 potential points). Just to add insult to injury, if you played a chart in an earlier game (which doesn't have the difficulty locking system, Extra notwithstanding) and it's above your permitted level, <em>the chart locks back up</em> for <em>GC4</em> until you meet its difficulty's requirements. This gets worse if you play in the US, where the NESiCA network goes into maintenance in the middle of the day or in the evening (in Asia, the maintenance takes place early in the morning), so even if you didn't mind playing a few casual rounds in guest play, if you mainly play "boss" charts you will not be able to play any of them during maintenance.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EightBeatStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EightBeatStory">8 Beat Story</a></em> does not give out cards for rank D scores, which is very jarring as other mobile rhythm games give at least one card upon clearing a stage. This essentially forces players to play lower difficulties to grind cards as leveling materials. For players entirely new to the genre, this is not a problem, but experienced players who have played other games are forced to play below their skill level for a while until they have gained sufficient team value to gain rank C in score.
</li><li> Slides in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Maimai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Maimai">maimai</a></em> are disliked by new players, partly because they require being tapped and <em>then</em> slid, but also because they can be rough on bare hands (as in, you can get blisters and friction burns from charts with lots of fast slides) and depending on how well-maintained the cabinet is, slides can fail to register causing "Late — Good" judgements at best and "Too Late — Miss" at worst. Many players are advised to wear low-friction gloves because of this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheIdolmasterCinderellaGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheIdolmasterCinderellaGirls">THE iDOLM@STER: Cinderella Girls</a> Starlight Stage</em> does a good job of avoiding most of its competitors' scrappy elements, but falls headlong into this with the Live Party event. In this event, a team is formed from five players' cards, who then play the song. Event points are awarded based on combined performance as well as "contribution", which turns out to be heavily based on how good your card is - if you're the only SR in a group of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SSRs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SSRs">SS Rs</a> you can expect to wind up in last place even if you get a full combo.
</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BEMANI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BEMANI">BEMANI</a> games will end your credit early if you fail on any non-final stage, meaning that you <em>have</em> to play it safe with chart selection on those stages just so you can get the most out of your money, only reserving pushing yourself for the last stage of your credit. Some games that do this offer some form of failure insurance (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Beatmania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Beatmania">beatmania</a> IIDX</em> offers DJ VIP Passes that guarantee three stages and playing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoundVoltex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoundVoltex">Sound Voltex</a></em> on Standard Start instead of Light Start lets you continue after failing a song, but only once), but those often require surcharges that are not supported on cabinets running in the United States. Only <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MUSECA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MUSECA">MÚSECA</a></em> guarantees three stages with no surcharge or multiplayer "saving" (having someone else in a match clear the song, which prevents everyone who failed from getting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a>) required, something that most modern non-Konami arcade rhythm games also do; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution">DanceDanceRevolution</a></em> also offers the same if you're playing in the US, where premium start is priced the same as standard start, but you need an eAMUSEMENT Pass to use premium

</li><li> Few rhythm games punish misses as harshly as <em>Re:Stage! Prism Step</em> does; expect a game over after making as few as <strong>two</strong> mistakes. This annoyed players to no end, at least until the stamina system was removed and you could retry songs as much as you wanted (or in this case, needed).
</li><li> <em>WACCA</em> will not let you use your Aime card to play if you already have data for the game in another region. (For example, if you have ever played the game in Japan with your card, you cannot use it in the United States.) This stands out in comparison to other net-enabled arcade games, which will either let you use data started from another region (most rhythm games) or make you use new region-specific data but at least not make you purchase a new card (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WanganMidnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WanganMidnight">Wangan Midnight</a> Maximum Tune</em>).

The developers obviously realized players would prefer to use Batman's gliding mechanic to driving. Their solution? Throw in an out-of-place mechanic where the batmobile would transform into a tank and fight drones. While this was tolerable at first, the game seemed to place more and more emphasis on it as the game went on, with tank missions becoming longer and more frequent. What's more, the changes made to ramp up the challenge were seen as more annoying than anything, with the stealth missions where the player was forced to stay out of a tank's line of sight and attack it from behind - while driving a tank - receiving the most vitriol from fans and critics.

<ul><li> The friendship system is best described with the following words: <strong>"HEY NIKO, IT'S ROMAN! LET'S GO BOWLING!"</strong> Rockstar North must have realized how annoying this system was too, as they made it optional in the first DLC pack, <em>The Lost and Damned</em>, and removed it altogether in <em>The Ballad of Gay Tony</em>.
<ul><li> Even worse than just receiving incessant calls from your, by the end of the game, <em>numerous</em> friends what feels like every ten minutes, inevitably interrupting whatever it is you're doing, they always want you to come and pick them up for whatever activity, despite them possibly being an extremely long drive away from you. They'll then have the nerve to complain about you being late, to the point you frequently lose approval. Oh, and accepting an invitation from one friend won't stop another from calling as well, and turning the second invitation down will still lose you brownie points with that person, despite how you're obviously otherwise occupied. Not to mention that you can also randomly receive a text from a friend you haven't been out with in a while complaining about not seeing you, complete with an added loss of approval. By the end you're left wondering why all of Niko's friends are so incredibly codependent.
</li></ul></li><li> PC users have an extra thorn in their sides with the lousy helicopter controls. It's very difficult to fly them well, and it gets even worse if the scenario requires you to enter aerial combat with them. On top of this, it is still possible (as always) for your friends to call you while flying.
</li></ul></li><li> The hunger system in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em> when it was introduced in beta 1.8. Before this, food <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperactiveMetabolism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperactiveMetabolism">instantly restored your health.</a> Once hunger was introduced, food no longer were instant heals (Potions of Healing covered that), but instead, food takes about 3 seconds to fully consume and they restore hunger points instead. Keeping your hunger full gives slow health regeneration but letting the meter fall too low prevents you from sprinting and letting it go fully empty will damage you and even outright kill you if playing on Hard difficulty. What makes it worse is doing too much physical stuff (running, mining, etc) will make you hungry more quickly and every piece of food has different amount of saturation, which determines how full you stay until the hunger meter starts to drop again. Naturally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">you aren't told of this</a>. It was downplayed after the 1.9 Combat update, that made the regeneration at full hunger much faster (though still consuming the same amount of saturation or hunger points).
</li><li> Easily the most widely loathed missions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIVBlackFlag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIVBlackFlag">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</a></em> were those requiring the player to tail NPCs on a journey, with special vitriol reserved for "eavesdropping" missions, which required the player to remain within a (very narrow) circumference from the target.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria">Terraria</a></em>:
<ul><li> To prevent healing spam, using any healing item will give a Potion Sickness debuff that prevents taking more for a minute. (Fourty-nine seconds with a certain accessory.) This is considered fine in normal gameplay, but against bosses, it can feel like forever before the player is allowed to heal again.
</li><li> Rain to earlygame playthrough as for players trying to farm herbs, as it summons annoying Flying Fish and nullifies the blooming conditions for Fireblossom. In Hardmode, the Angry Nimbus enemy appears, which can easily kill an unprepared or unexpecting player early in Hardmode if they do not find shelter or have no means of fighting it off.
</li><li> Blood Moons and Solar Eclipses, respectively a night that increases enemy spawns and a day that spawns special powerful enemies on the surface. They're intense fun at the earlier points they can happen, but once the player gets better gear and good weapons, they turn in to one-shotting truckloads of weak enemies and hoping that they don't overwhelm the world's NPCs. And unlike most other events, which end after killing a certain amount of enemies, these need to be waited out.
</li><li> The Angler's quests. He will ask for a fish somewhere in the world, which can be obtained by fishing in a given biome long enough, and giving it to him will net a reward. The problem is that the rewards are completely random, the quests can only be done once per in-game day, and three of the prizes are needed to craft a convenient high-tier item that has information and home-teleportation all in one (saving inventory slots). Because of this, getting unique items from him is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a> that requires waiting whole in-game days just for a chance at getting something, and making matters worse, he can give duplicates of the same item the player already has. There's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAchievement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAchievement">an achievement</a> for doing 200 of these quests, and it's one of the lowest-obtained achievements in the game. There is an item that fast-forwards time to the next dawn and thus getting another quest in with less time, but using it has a cooldown time of one in-game week. Then are the quests that cannot be reasonably be done at a certain stage of the game, such as if he asks for a fish on a Sky Lake before having the tools to conveniently find and reach one, or if he asks for one in a Mushroom biome when the player has yet to find one.
</li><li> The Goblin Tinkerer can reforge a weapon or accessory to change its modifier at a cost, which can greatly boost its properties. This is disliked by most players due to being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a>, where by complete chance he can give a bad modifier to a powerful weapon, and the only way of undoing that is to pay him more coins to try to reforge for something else. Some times, the player might make their Solar Eruption Godly on the first try. Other times, that Celestial Shell might keep becoming Angry and Spiked for a while, before finally settling on Menacing, the accessory modifier that is a direct upgrade of the previous two. The Tinkerer is seen as a huge money sink because of this.

<ul><li> In the spinoff <em>Viper Phase 1</em>, you get a multiplier applied to your end-of-stage bonuses dependent on what percentage of enemies you killed. If you destroy every single enemy, the muliplier is x100. But if you so much as miss a single enemy, that multiplier drops to a x50. It won't matter much in a survival-oriented run, but in a score-based run, missing one enemy can make a massive difference.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaidenFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaidenFighters">Raiden Fighters</a></em> has the Micluses, little blue critters that spit out medals and then explode to give you a point bonus. Not too bad at first, if it weren't for the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">nearly all Micli are hidden in nondescript locations or require obscure conditions</a>.

Some knowledged players would rather play Original Mode in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasierThanEasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasierThanEasy">Practice difficulty</a> over this.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MushihimeSama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MushihimeSama">Mushihime Sama</a> Futari</em>, bombing takes 1,500-2,000 from your counter/multiplier, and dying takes off 1/3 of your current total, so it's in your best interest to bomb if you're in danger. But in <em>Futari <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Black Label</a></em>, it's roughly the other way around; dying takes off 1,500-2,000 and bombing takes off about 6,000-8,000. So if you wanna cash that huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">30,000</a> multiplier in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">God mode</a>, but dying appears to be inevitable (which for inexperienced players is most of the time)...

Not only can a chain consist of only one color, forcing you to leave roughly 2/3 of enemies intact and allowed to attack you, but while scoring in <em>Ikaruga</em> is completely optional, in <em>Radiant Silvergun</em> it's <strong>mandatory.</strong> Why? Because your points are used to level up your weapons, and if you can't score well, your weapons will be underpowered and you'll be unable to rapidly damage later bosses, which can lead to a very quick <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Parodius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Parodius">Parodius</a></em> features a powerup roulette (called <em>Blizzard</em> in Europe),which is triggered by a random power capsule in the game.The mechanic wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the existence of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonMushroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonMushroom">!?/OH (MY GOD)! "powerup"</a> on the power meter, which nullifies every powerup you have. Woe the players who raged when they hit that so-called "powerup".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Embodiment of Scarlet Devil</em>'s rank system, in which the longer you go without dying, the faster and denser the bullets get. Max-rank <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm">Patchouli</a> is harder than the final boss.
</li><li> <em>Perfect Cherry Blossom</em> and <em>Imperishable Night</em> have non-spellcard patterns highly resistant to bombing. Less bad in <em>IN</em>, since relatively few of these patterns are difficult, and a Last Spell<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note132j5u');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note132j5u" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note132j5u');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">unique to <em>IN</em>, bombing immediately after death will produce an exceptionally powerful attack at the cost of two bombs</span> will still deal significant damage, but <em>PCB</em> has a number of very long, very difficult nonspells, and no way to deal with them other than toughing them out.
</li><li> Scoring systems in early <em>Touhou</em> games are generally a pain to figure out, but <em>Imperishable Night</em> in particular is pretty bad. To put it simply: Main body of stage? Don't focus, ever. Bosses? Don't un-focus, ever.
</li><li> The Faith system in <em>Mountain of Faith</em>, where scoring high means no deaths, and exclusively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NormallyIWouldBeDeadNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NormallyIWouldBeDeadNow">deathbombing</a> (and even then, only at certain points). This wouldn't be too annoying, but extra lives are only given upon reaching high scores, essentially forcing players into a scorerun (in a fandom where the number of players who play for score can be counted on one hand) if they want more lives.
</li><li> The continue system introduced in this game in which continuing snaps you back to the beginning of the stage with a mere two lives, beside being <strong>incredibly frustrating</strong> to redo 4-5 minutes of gameplay, you also can only practice levels you've beaten making every difficult moment in the game a solid wall, and most Touhou players would be aiming for a continue-less run anyway without the momentum-killing snap-back. Thankfully, <em>Ten Desires</em> has fixed this particular mechanic, returning to the old continue system.
</li><li> The weather system in <em>Scarlet Weather Rhapsody</em> is generally okay, but Typhoon Weather eliminates hitstun and blocking for about 45 seconds. Spring Haze Weather prevents both players from using physical attacks. River Mist Weather moves the characters back and forth, screwing up tons of combos and attacks that require certain spacing. Amusingly enough, River Mist is representative of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami">Komachi</a>, the character who requires the most precise spacing to fight well, and whose in-canon power is defined as "manipulation of distance." Spring Haze was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">nerfed</a> to near pointlessness in <em>Hisoutensoku</em>, though<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14a70p');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note14a70p" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14a70p');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">instead of disabling physical attacks it allows them to be dashed through like bullet attacks, but at the cost of rapidly lowering the meter used for most attacks. Also, the time it lasts was lowered, and dashing through <em>any</em> attack lowers the time even further</span>.
</li><li> <em>Undefined Fantastic Object</em>'s UFO system is actually quite nice, but most of the UFOs change color periodically. It's not uncommon to need one more UFO in a sequence, then have it change color right before you get it, screwing up your whole plan. Trying to collect a quickly-moving token randomly floating around the screen in the short time frame that it's the correct color doesn't exactly mix well with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">Bullet Hell</a>. To make things worse, it's the only way to gain lives or bombs.
</li><li> <em>Ten Desires</em> spirit system for gaining lives and bombs is moderately irritating on its own, since they don't fall down the screen like regular items. The <em>real</em> scrappy mechanic, though, is the trance system. You build up a meter by collecting spirits (most of which don't act as bomb/life fragments), and when full can activate it for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a>. Two problems: First, it also <em>doubles the effect of bomb and life spirits</em>, and, second, you automatically use it if you die. This essentially means that you're denied from using a powerful attack as an actual attack, you need to memorize the best places to use it, and dying generally throws off your rhythm for around a stage.
</li><li> <em>Double Dealing Character</em> and its system for gaining additional lives and bombs. Basically, you go to the Point of Collection to auto-grab every item on screen, and the game gives you a multiplier for the score from these items and drops a live/bomb fragment depending on how many of those items you grabbed. On one hand, it makes collecting lives simple and quick, on the other, trying to do so in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">Bullet Hell</a>-heavy sections is almost impossible, and every time you do get to the top of the screen there is a chance of getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollisionDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollisionDamage">slammed into by surprise by something that just entered the screen</a>.
</li><li> <em>Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom</em> with its Pointdevice mode, which removes lives and instead has checkpoints. Remember what Fujiwara no Mokou said about dying repeatedly without actually dying being painful? Now you get to learn the daily life of Mokou. Have fun raging at spellcards that you cannot seem to clear, have no bombs left in stock, while your capture records states "0/99+". There's Legacy mode, which does have lives, but getting the good ending requires no deaths in Legacy.
</li><li> The teleportation mechanic in <em>Violet Detector</em> suffers from wonky controls. It's activated by pressing Shift twice in a row without holding any direction, which is fairly easy to do by accident (which will probably either send you straight into a bullet or throw you off for long enough to get you killed anyway) if you find yourself focusing and unfocusing frequently. And when you <em>do</em> need to use the mechanic, having to hit Shift twice makes it annoying to teleport in time to get away from a threat. Mapping "teleport" to the unused C button instead would probably have been more practical.
</li><li> Wily Beast and Weakest Creature sports a revamped version of the UFO mechanic with spirits, which is actually very welcome (considering life and bomb pieces don't cycle anymore, for starters). However, there's the Rare Creature mechanic to sour your day. You can get a Rare Creature in each stage that's completely separate from the three regular ones, which will grant you with bonus items if you can get it and manage to finish a beast release with it, without breaking it (read: don't get hit for however long your release lasts). Problem 1: the way to get each rare creature differs depending on the stage, and some of them can be aggravating. Try clearing a mid boss at point blank in a bullet hell game aggravating (and the game's definition of "point blank" is finicky, to say the least). Or clearing a spell card while being unable to use half the screen for dodging. Problem 2: nowhere in the game you're told how to get a rare creature to appear until after you make it appear for the first time. Problem 3: each creature is tied to a trophy, so better get those creatures to appear if you want to 100% the game.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleGaregga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleGaregga">Battle Garegga</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicDifficulty">rank</a> system.

The rank scale for enemy aggressiveness is capped in the last two stages to playable levels, in a rare show of mercy by the developers.

Each of the 7 tiers of stages has a "default rank", which the game sets to when you collect a powerup on that tier. And once you raise the rank, there is no way to decrease it. Ideally, you want to stop powering up after the 4th stage. Wait, what's that? You lost a couple lives on the last stage and took a big hit in shot power? Too bad! Either deal with it or face a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultySpike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultySpike">Difficulty Spike</a>!

This caused a huge problem at a shmup tournament where many players who couldn't get on the in-game high score table either manually calculated their scores by hand or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit">simply didn't bother to submit scores</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Guwange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Guwange">Guwange</a></em> has you collect coins to raise your score, while shooting enemies to keep the coin collection timer from running out (at which point your coin count drops to 0). And the chain timer is more lenient than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonPachi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonPachi">DoDonPachi</a></em>'s, so chaining in this game shouldn't be as big of a pain in the ass, right? Well, here's where the game kicks you in the face: your coin count carries over between stages, meaning that in order to obtain a very good score, you need to keep your coin timer from resetting <em>at all</em> throughout the entire game. Have it reset halfway through the game? Time to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit">Rage Quit</a>!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeavyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeavyWeapon">Heavy Weapon</a></em> for the PC. Your tank aims using the mouse cursor, that's fine. The problem is that it <em>also moves towards the mouse cursor</em>, making it annoying to dodge attacks while aiming. This makes facing enemies like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvancingBossOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvancingBossOfDoom">Bulldozers</a> (which move towards you and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> you if you brush against them) a complete pain.

Now penalizing a player for using a continue is fine, but this means if you set a record score on your first credit, and you decide to continue (e.g. to practice or unlock later stages), then the game will invalidate your score. The worst part is, <em>the developer knows this</em>, as there is a line of text stating that your score will not be saved in such cases. This is in contrast to the other two games in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheTaleOfALLTYNEX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheTaleOfALLTYNEX">The Tale of ALLTYNEX</a></em> series, where using a continue will still allow you to save the score you got on your first credit.

So that stage you're struggling to clear? To be allowed to practice it, you have to clear it in a full run in the first place!

However, if you are playing for score, your character (which determines your secondary weapon) and your choice of Time Capsule don't mean anything, because using either of these resets your multiplier, in a game that touts time manipulation as one of its primary gimmicks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Eschatos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Eschatos">Eschatos</a></em> can be extremely annoying to play for score:
<ul><li> In Original mode, your multiplier builds up as you destroy enemy waves. However, for each enemy that escapes, your multiplier decreases by one. If you die, you also suffer the same penalty...but during the time it takes for your ship to respawn, a whole wave of enemies may leave the screen, and depending on how high your multiplier is that means five to ten past minutes of hard work thrown completely out the window.
</li><li> In Advanced mode, the penalties for enemies escaping is more lenient, but there's a new Scrappy Mechanic in town: Collecting a bomb item immediately clears all enemies and turns bullets into purple tetrahedrons that boost your score...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUpLetdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUpLetdown">but it also reduces your multiplier and reduces your shot power by one level</a>. Collecting multiple bombs in succession is a good way to damage your multiplier and severely weaken yourself. Therefore, Advanced turns into a game of avoiding not only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">bullets</a>, but also <em>items</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Are you playing the North American PS1 port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RayStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RayStorm">RayStorm</a></em>? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadExportForYou">Bad Export for You</a>! Specifically, not only are the default settings played around, with the most important change being that each stage's difficulty is raised from 2 (out of 8) to 4, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyModeMockery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyModeMockery">dropping any stage's difficulty below 4 triggers "Training Mode", in which the game ends after stage 4</a>. This is not in any other version of the game, making it a slap in the face to anyone who prefers to play on more "official" settings. Fortunately, <em>RayStorm HD</em> and the mobile ports don't have this issue, as Working Designs had nothing to do with these ports.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TonyHawksProSkater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TonyHawksProSkater">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a></em>:
<ul><li> The on-foot mechanics were widely reviled by fans and critics alike for giving players an extremely easy way to avoid bailing.
</li><li> On foot was made worse for <em>Tony Hawk's American Wasteland</em>, with the addition of Parkour. In theory a good idea, in practice a <strong>bailproof</strong> way to add another 500 points and at least another three numbers to your multiplier.
</li><li> <em>Tony Hawk's Underground</em> allows you to drive cars. These vehicles had all the handling of a pinball in a table made of ice. Aside from the goals, use of them is redundant, as they reset back where they started in a level when you're done, meaning you can't even create a new combo line with them.
</li><li> <em>Tony Hawk's Underground 2</em> then gave us more vehicles—not cars, vehicles you can do tricks with, such as a motorized skateboard, a tricycle, a go-kart, and a bucking bull on wheels. They all had about four tricks, and most of them were so very anti-intuitive to use due to not being able to stop. The last three examples were implemented so poorly they were removed from the sequels.
</li><li> <em>Tony Hawk's Project 8</em> then gave us Nail the Trick, where the analogue sticks control your feet. It was an entirely alien control scheme that stuck around into <em>Tony Hawk's Proving Ground</em>, where it's only useful for the specific goals, and is otherwise unusable in a regular combo.
</li><li> Grinding in the original <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</em> was incredibly difficult due to the hypersensitive controls that required you to mash left and right on the d-pad to balance yourself. It was quite a feat to be able to grind for more than a couple of seconds without falling on your ass.
</li><li> Lip tricks are by far the worst type of tricks on the first era of Tony Hawk's game (and the HD remake). They give little points, only works when you're straight as an arrow, and can ruin combos when they're accidentally performed. Until <em>THPS3</em>, it also had no way to balance it out and the skater would always bail if you kept holding for more than 4 seconds. It's less terrible in the modern games, but there's still some problems. For example, there's a goal on <em>American Wasteland</em> when you have to lip trick through <strong>an entire rotation of Santa Monica's Giant Wheel</strong> (thankfully only on Sick difficulty).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NCAAFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NCAAFootball">NCAA Football</a></em> has a despised system for making phone calls to recruits which basically spins a roulette wheel of topics, allowing you the option of pitching your school's merits on that topic or discrediting your rivals on that topic. It's obnoxious enough that you, the head coach, can't choose to pitch whatever you want. This can lead to the bizarre result that the coach of Stanford might never get to sell his school's academics or the coach of Miami can never sell the school's gorgeous campus. However the roulette wheel sometimes stops on topics that you know the player doesn't care about leaving you forced to try and pitch him anyway. This has been removed for <em>NCAA 13</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NHLHockey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NHLHockey">NHL Hockey</a></em> has the goaltender controls which tend to not allow the free range of motion necessary to replicate real life goalie positioning. The worst offender being the hug post command which can frequently make you hug the wrong post and get stuck to it until you release the trigger, which will give the opposing player plenty of time to score on a wide open net.
</li><li> Besides the play mentioned above, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaddenNFL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaddenNFL">Madden NFL</a> has had a few:
<ul><li> The mobile version of Madden 12 has a mechanic that makes an open receiver on a go route virtually impossible to tackle if you're playing man coverage. It can be especially annoying if your opponent keeps throwing 80 touchdown passes.
</li><li> Madden 06 had the infamous "QB cone". Basically, your quarterback had a vision cone extending outwards from their bodies, and they could only throw accurately to receivers in that cone. The size of the cone was determined by the QB's awareness stat: top-tier quarterbacks like Brett Favre, Peyton Manning, and Tom Brady had huge cones, whereas backups had tiny slivers. It was frustrating to use and in some ways counterproductive, since a smaller vision cone could be used to fake defenders off of a receiver you actually wanted to pass to. The feature was gone by Madden 08.
</li><li> The QB cone made the game damn near unplayable on the PC version. Previous installments had the player aim with the mouse and throw by left clicking while using standard WSAD keys (and those directly around them) for moving the QB. However, once the vision cone was implemented, you still aimed with the mouse but needed to press a separate key on the keyboard in order to actually throw the pass to that receiver. Trying to do that while moving your QB away from pressure seemingly required a 3rd hand. It's little wonder that the PC version of the game stopped being made shortly thereafter...(The PC version would make a comeback for <em>Madden 19</em>, long after the QB cone mechanic had been retired.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em>ESPN MLB 2K5</em> had a gimmick mechanic called Slam Zone; if a pitcher screwed up badly in delivering a pitch or a batter guessed location and pitch correctly, the game would break into a mini-game in which the pitcher and batter tapped the buttons as fast as possible, while the pitch was zoomed in on in slow motion. If the batter won the duel, he would uncork a home run. Not only did it break the immersive TV-like presentation, but was also very much un-sim for a baseball simulation. It wasn't brought back after the one-year experiment.
</li><li> <em>NBA 2K14</em>: The game giving you a technical foul for swearing when your X-Box One's Kinect or your Playstation 4's Camera recognizes the word or words said. That's <em>when</em> it recognizes the word or words said, it can be a little spotty about it. This means that the game gives a free throw to the opponent for the player swearing in the comfort of their own home. Thankfully, it can be turned off by disabling voice commands. Youtube user randomfrankp <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/Q5okb9Vc8SY">does not take it well<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. <br/>The Kinect or Eyetoy can be used in 2K15 to scan your face. At least it would, except it does not work period, full stop, that's it, finish, the end. You are supposed to have plenty of lighting but this causes the scan to go haywire, being too far away results in a poor scan, moving closer has it lose track, on the off chance the scan goes well the game will apparently decide it's not fair for everyone else struggling and say it cannot be used, if you do get to where the scan uploads the game will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit">Rage Quit</a> and crash, ect, ect, in short it's much easier to use the in game sliders and build a face from scratch than use the camera scan. <em>2K17</em> replaced this with a phone based program, however if you did not also get the newest phone on the market when the game was released you're out of luck as it will only work for smartphones that are iPhone or Samsung 8 and beyond.

One of the first things confirmed for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIII">Assassin's Creed III</a></em> was that Den Defense would be cut.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dishonored" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dishonored">Dishonored</a></em> has the Chaos system. Now, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Karma Meter</a> in general tends to be a spotty thing in videogames, but the Chaos system is particularly grating for two reasons. Firstly, as the game boasts, the Chaos system directly affects the game-world... by making it so much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> that the player risks being plunged into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy">Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy</a>. Even in the medium Chaos path, the game tries to hit the player with a serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard">You Bastard!</a> effect. The darkness of the high Chaos path is so much that several of the loading screen tips actively warn players against pursuing that route. This would be bad enough, but then there's reason number two: the game's most interesting and innovative features are all <em>combat based</em>. And combat is how Chaos is raised, due to the player leaving dead opponents behind and their bodies getting eaten by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague">plague rats</a>. So, a player who doesn't want to get high Chaos has to forfeit playing around with all of the cool tricks that the game advertises, such as intricate sword duels, using traps, summoning rat swarms, etc. Add in some rather counter-intuitive aspects to Chaos (for example, killing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicallyLivingZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicallyLivingZombie">Weepers</a> raises Chaos, despite that this is arguably a mercy and protects those who haven't been infected) and how strict it is (if the total of surviving humans drop below 80% <em>at any point</em>, your Chaos rises to medium level).

<ul><li> Across all <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> games you lack the ability to take rounds out of one weapon and put them in another; once you feed a gun some rounds they belong to that gun <em>forever</em> unless it's a specific weapon that holds multiple ammo types (and even then, you can only take rounds out by loading other rounds in). While it's not an issue in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1">the original PS1 game</a> as there's only one kind of gun for each ammo type or in the later games that were much more action-oriented and ammo conservation wasn't a necessity, this is <em>monumentally</em> annoying in the games in-between where ammunition and item space are seriously limited and there are multiple guns that share the same ammo like the regular and assault shotguns in the REmake or the handgun and Colt SSA in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2">Resident Evil 2</a></em>. Even in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Remake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Remake">Resident Evil 3 (Remake)</a></em> where you will find multiple copies of the <em>same gun</em>, you have to carefully ration away one of the gun's bullets and then discard it if you want to use them rather than being able to empty the bullets into your inventory.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilOutbreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilOutbreak">Resident Evil: Outbreak</a></em> has largely been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">Vindicated by History</a> and has nestled into the status of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic">Cult Classic</a>, its fans never-the-less dislike the Virus Gauge for adding a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">pointless timer</a> to levels and forcing you to waste pills that you <em>could</em> use to recover health on keeping it down instead. In theory it was added to discourage hogging servers in an era when online gaming was dodgy with limited server space but the game's nature as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror">Survival Horror</a> meant lingering in levels was a bad move to begin with, rendering it redundant at absolute best.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil0" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil0">Resident Evil 0</a></em>:
<ul><li> The lack of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hammerspace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hammerspace">item box</a>, which has been a series staple in nearly every other installment and allows the player to stow away the items they've collected for later use, with every item box in the game conveniently connected to each other. Instead, in this game, excess items can either be dropped in a specific location to come back to later, or stored with the partner character who, like the player character, has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InventoryManagementPuzzle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InventoryManagementPuzzle">limited number of item slots</a>. Key items, like the inventory-slot-consuming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrapplingHookPistol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrapplingHookPistol">Hookshot</a>, also take up valuable space. Additionally, moving from one major hub location, such as the Management Training Facility, to another can involve multiple trips back and forth to ferry items over, which would be completely eliminated if there were just item boxes. For comparision, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1">Resident Evil</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">remake</a> featured unconnected item boxes as a particularly difficult <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">challenge mode</a> wherein the player had to carefully select what to take with them, and this game took place in a largely centralized mansion rather than being spread out across numerous facilities and a train.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5">Resident Evil 5</a></em>:
<ul><li> The very core mechanic of the game, the two-person team, was barely tolerated at best and outright despised at worst. Sheva (or Chris in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>) has such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">abysmally stupid AI</a> that, between blowing ammo that <em>you</em> could use to effectively take out enemies, wasting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse">first-aid sprays</a> on papercuts, running gleefully into the blades of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpider">Chain Saw Majini</a>, and giving you a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> after getting her head immediately sawed off as a result, and as numerous "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">solo-mode mods</a>" have proven, the game is <em>actually easier</em> without her "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingVideoGameHelper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingVideoGameHelper">helping</a>" you. She only becomes a welcome addition to the team if you manage to beat the game and unlock the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Longbow</a>, which has unlimited ammo and high damage at the cost of lacking an aiming reticle (which has no effect on an AI partner), which means she's actually able to carry her weight.
</li><li> The fact that your AI-Partner could <em>say no</em> when you needed an item or issued an order. You don't get full control over item management like you did in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil0" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil0">Resident Evil 0</a></em>: this time around if your partner has an item you want you need to ask for it, and the partner can actually refuse, leaving you in a tight spot if you really need those shotgun shells but Sheva for some reason decides she can do better with them. What was meant to add to the game's immersion and make you feel like you truly are part of a team instead only added an unnecessary annoyance factor, made only worse by some dodgy game mechanics that would sometimes make an item request impossible because the game thought you were too far apart to do it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil6">Resident Evil 6</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mostly at the beginning (but still found throughout) the game will decide to disable certain actions of your character. For example, during a tense scene you'll lose the ability to open your inventory or make your character run, instead forcing you to walk <em>ever so slowly</em> across the wide sprawling room.
</li><li> The "Health Tablets" as well. When you pick up a herb you can't just use it, you have to convert it into a health tablet first then use a <em>separate button</em> to eat the tablet and restore health. Figuring this out is a major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> for a lot of players, and many players never figure out how to use the First Aid sprays <em>at all.</em>
</li><li> Having to move around as a squad for the first few chapters of Chris' campaign amounts to one <em>massive</em> scrappy mechanic due to some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">very poorly coded AI</a>. Your squad tends to just sort of clump around you most of the time and not only can you not push them out of the way at all, but they can push you around just by walking into you. You will take so much damage from being unable to avoid an attack thanks to a squad member awkwardly standing beside you that watching the Iluzija pick them off one-by-one is one of the most satisfying moments of the game.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFrame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFrame">Fatal Frame</a></em>

In order to dispel it (and be able to see things more clearly), you must light purifying candles. So now, you not only have to worry about random ghost encounters while you're running around this mansion of horrors and trying to progress the storyline, but you've also got to keep an eye on your candle level, because once that candle runs out, the entire setting will change to a grainy black-and-white and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvancingBossOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvancingBossOfDoom">Reika Kuze</a> will show up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">relentlessly chase you down</a> until you find another candle and top up your light. Those candles are: a) rare (there are only three or four of them in the game, though they respawn during each new Night), b) spread out from each other, and c) finish very quickly. Oh, and that house you're wandering around in? Is <em>enormous</em> (easily the largest of any single one of the Fatal Frame houses) and very easy to get lost in.

When playing as Ruka, the player must sometimes play some notes on a piano by pointing the WiiMote at the correct, lit-up key and press said key, while also not being too fast or slow. The annoyance comes from the fact that it must be done as part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss Battle</a> and the keys are pretty narrow, with the WiiMote not being all that happy to comply with your trying to play the keys. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And if you fail three times, you must fight Sakuya's ghost again and try the piano another time.</span>

In itself not bad, but it includes a long, slow zoom-in on Mio picking the item up. And the same mechanic was added for investigating under things, inside cabinets or peeking into locations. A good hour or two of the game is spent watching this zoom-in, instead of simply letting the player pick up the item with a short press of the A button. <em>And then</em> you also have the ghost hands that have a random chance of attempting to grab Mio's wrist while trying to pick up an item. Overall, they don't do any damage (except for one fast, darker hand with slash marks on it, but can be easily shaken off) and it's actually minor. But put in conjunction with the entire mechanic and having to re-zoom after avoiding the ghost hand...

Parasite Eve 2 made it where only items attached to your armor is what you can access during a battle. So if you attached 4 healing items, used them all up in a fight and need to get more, you're out of luck. Attaching items to your armor didn't free up any space in your main inventory.
<ul><li> Compounding this is two problems. One, you're going to stumble across a lot of healing items, which take some stress off of your magic, but space is again limited; and Two, if you find the rare Medical Wheel item (or any of the four special items for that matter), they'll take up slots on your armor as well, significantly reducing how much you're going to carry unless you really don't mind running back and forth to item boxes repeatedly.

For the first half of the game the apartment is a safe zone where your health replenishes. Roughly halfway through the game the fan stops working which somehow not only negates the healing factor (meaning your <em>only</em> means of replenishing health are curative items), but ghosts begin invading the apartment which can block access to your item box and sap your health. The only way to rid yourself of them are the medallions and candles, which are not only limited in number but also given to you much earlier on as a means to defend yourself against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">the otherwise invincible victim ghosts</a> that attack you in the otherworld. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Keep in mind the game never tells you you'll need these items for your apartment</a>, and you can render the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign">Unwinnable by Design</a> if you use them too readily.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar">Gears of War</a></em> has had a few in each game, typically remedied in the following title.
<ul><li> The first had general <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a> on the part of AI squadmates, the inability to move while downed (meaning that your teammates had to rush into whatever location was dangerous enough for you to be downed in the first place), and the fact that going down while playing solo meant instant death. Thankfully remedied in the sequel, which improved the AI pathing and gave them the ability to revive other squadmates, including you. However, it had its own set of problems, not the least of which being...
</li><li> ...Shotgun charges, which became an epidemic in multiplayer due to the weapon's absurd reach. A "stopping power" mechanic was added that meant the game would resist the attempt to run straight into enemy fire, but it did little to weaken the sheer destructiveness of the Gnasher. <em>Gears of War 3</em>, thankfully, buffed the standard rifles so they did more damage.
</li><li> In both games, co-op campaign had several portions where Dom and Marcus separated, meaning that if either dropped, there was no one to revive him and it was a game over. This was fixed in the third installment by the introduction of Arcade Mode, where dead players respawn after 25 seconds as long as at least one human player is alive.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em> showed its first-game syndrome signs by sporting a few of these.
<ul><li> The Splatfest Tee is considered by many to be a source of unnecessary grinding. You are given the shirt up to 1 week beforehand, but it is a three-star shirt with three empty slots—so it takes the most experience to max out—and you are expected to level it up from scratch. Granted, the extra abilities are weaker and affected by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiminishingReturnsForBalance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiminishingReturnsForBalance">Diminishing Returns</a>, but if you wanna be in top form in Splatfest, or even in Ranked Battle, which is the fastest way to level up the shirt (...if you win), then you might want the extra skills. Also, you are forced to use it in Splatfest, and you might not appreciate the Special Saver ability over the other abilities on your other clothes. And finally, the shirt is taken away at the end of Splatfest, making all the effort seem wasted.
</li><li> Splatfests region and team-locking you for the duration, meaning that the matchmaking pool is much smaller, and it can't shuffle teams if there is a significant imbalance.
</li><li> Getting disconnected counts as a loss. Meaning you could be winning and suddenly, because of an unstable connection, lose the match and lose the rank you just acquired. It's supposed to discourage people from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit">Rage Quitting</a>, but the game can't tell if someone intentionally disconnected, or just suffered a bad connection.
</li><li> Matchmaking in Squad Battles is set up in such a way that if you have even a <em>single</em> S-rank player on your squad, you'll regularly be put up against squads that are <em>all</em> S-ranks, even if your own team has only one S-rank player and the rest are B or C rank.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2">Splatoon 2</a></em> fixed some of the problems from the first game, but it has its own problems, too.
<ul><li> Salmon Run is a popular addition to the game, but it's not available all the time and players have no control over what weapons they get to use for each round.
</li><li> Also, ragequits or disconnects in Salmon Run are treated as losses on wave one, no matter what wave you got tossed in. It is entirely possible to lose your rank all because your connection shat itself.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warhammer40000SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warhammer40000SpaceMarine">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine</a></em> multiplayer disables the text chat when one is dead and waiting for respawn. This despite the game being one of fast-paced action, when those moments are the only ones when you have, you know, <em>time</em> to type anything.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising">Kid Icarus: Uprising</a></em> is generally considered a solid multi-player game, but some features are considered these to different parts of the player base, while others are fine with it due to the fact that it simply makes the game different from other shooting games.
<ul><li> An example would be the fact that unlike other shooters, the shots you fire aren't instant and actually travel through the air, and home in on the opponent. Some weapons have more homing than others, and you can use powers to make the shots <em>invisible and pass through walls</em>.
</li><li> Others hate the weapon value system, forcing people to spend hours fusing weapons to do exactly what they want and nothing more, lest their weapon becomes more valuable and makes them a greater burden to their team when they lose. Others feel that the game is based much more on skill so a person with a higher value weapon is fine as long as they have the skill to match.
</li><li> The game just isn't designed for left-handed players. You can map the four face buttons to movement, but this causes problems as the game differentiates between "flick" directional movements and slower tilt movements. You can use a Circle Pad Pro or a New Nintendo 3DS so that you have a Circle Pad on the right, but the former is an additional $20 investment and the latter's right pad isn't as precise as the left pad.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxCommand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxCommand">Star Fox Command</a></em>'s online multiplayer would terminate matches if a single player disconnected. Not just for the quitter, but <em>everyone else in the match</em>. As such, ragequitters became the collective target of murderous hatred for everyone who just wanted to have a complete match.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder18');">    Tower Defence </div><div class="folder" id="folder18" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> An almost universal one in tower defence games are flying units. Usually they either can't be damaged by a lot of tower types (requiring you to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialisation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialisation">specialised anti-air towers which are useless against the more common ground units</a> or large numbers of the towers which <em>can</em> hit both fliers and ground units which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">are often pretty mediocre against both</a> and which can end up overtaxed with too many targets), or they fly over obstacles to reach the objective you're trying to defend, rendering maze strategies useless against them. More often than not, it's <em>both.</em> Fliers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DefenseGridTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DefenseGridTheAwakening">Defense Grid: The Awakening</a></em> were <em>so</em> annoying (as well as employing both of the aforementioned factors, any cores they stole from the housing could not be recovered if you shot them down, making them lost forever) that they were removed from the sequel entirely- and absolutely <em>nobody</em> missed them!
<ul><li> On a similar note, while usually not as disliked as flyers, stealth units aren't very popular either, for much the same reasons- they require the use of specific detector towers, upgrades or abilities to deal with which you would otherwise have no real reason to use and can feel like a waste of resources, unless they also have a secondary function.

While they were fairly useful to you (particularly the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game Breaking</a> Freeze Missile), your enemies can use them too and have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">unlimited energy</a>: expect to regularly get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunLock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunLock">Stun Locked</a> by the computer spamming Freeze Missiles and just draining most, if not all, of your health.

</li><li> Earlier games giving the computer unlimited specials. Granted the computer technically has unlimited <em>everythings</em>, but that's hard to notice and the AI doesn't abuse it too much. It's particularly glaring with specials though as their whole purpose is to be overpowered and unique, which makes them outright overwhelming when unlimited, <em>especially</em> with Club Kid's (creates an inescapable vortex that sucks you in and explodes), and Axel's (sends out a shockwave that hurls you into the air) who will, without fail, hit you with two or three of them if you ever dare to come within range.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DanganRonpa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DanganRonpa">Danganronpa</a></em> has the "Hangman's Gambit" mini game and its variations. It's basically picking up letters that appear randomly on the screen and piecing them together the answer to a question, but all games execute this idea poorly:
<ul><li> In general, one of the main flaws of this minigame is that even if you know the next letter, you have to wait until it appears, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">you have a time limit to worry about</a>, so you may fail without ever getting the chance to input the answer you knew. And on the highest difficulty level, you only get one or two letters as hints, so you're out of luck if you didn't already figure the answer out yourself.
</li><li> In the first game, the letters move so fast they are hard to get, they require multiple clicks before being registered (and you can accidentally click the wrong letter if you click too fast), and if you don't already know the answer, you are not given time to think about it and have to just click random letters in hope for a tip.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SuperDanganRonpa2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SuperDanganRonpa2">Super Danganronpa 2</a></em> changes the game a bit: instead of just shooting letters that appear and disappear, letters move across the screen in pairs, and you can pick one up and drop it elsewhere. If two different letters collide, you lose life. If two of the same letters collide, they fuse together, stop moving, and you can either destroy them or check if they're the next letter in the word. Once again, you need to wait a lot until the correct letter appears (if you even know what it is), and you can accidentally destroy it if you're not careful.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/NewDanganRonpaV3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/NewDanganRonpaV3">New Danganronpa V3</a></em>'s version hides all the letters, with a wave of light randomly revealing them. You can also light up the center of the screen to reveal the letters there, but 1: this only lights up a small area that grows slowly, 2: this consumes your focus meter, which regenerates very slowly, so you can't rely on it, and 3: you can't use the cursor while using this light.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ShinraiBrokenBeyondDespair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ShinraiBrokenBeyondDespair">Shinrai: Broken Beyond Despair</a></em>, like many other visual novels, has more than a few dialogue choices, from inconsequential (telling Rie what you think of her costume) to dramatically changing the story (choosing the culprit). The Scrappy Mechanic in question is how once you come to one of those points, you can't save the game, review your evidence or reread the dialogue. By removing the ability to look at your information, making an informed decision becomes harder, and the inability to save in case you make the wrong choice forces players to save often.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder21');">    Web Tournaments </div><div class="folder" id="folder21" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The Sai<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe">Moe</a> tournament has not one but two Scrappy Mechanics, and they make each other more Scrappy to boot. To sum it up:
<ul><li> First, the seeding is completely random. So you can end with 3 very popular girls in the first match while an entire division may be full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jobber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jobber">jobbers</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CListFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CListFodder">C-List Fodder</a>. Or worse, a division with Jobbers, C List Fodder and some popular girl, who then gets a free pass to quarters. The thing is, there's a nomination process and a classification round before the final bracket, so they could use proper seeding if they wanted to.
</li><li> Second and worse, it's the rule to determine if a series is eligible to enter the contest or not. To summarize, at least 50% of your running time must have been between last year's July and the current year's June. In theory, it's to avoid having the same girls every year. However, in practice it means that girls from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwelveEpisodeAnime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwelveEpisodeAnime">12-Episode Anime</a> with closed endings get only one shot, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">Long-Runners</a> with several seasons or seasons placed in the middle of the year can get many, many chances (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler">Hayate the Combat Butler</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a></em> in particular have been in FOUR years in a row), making the rule worthless. Worse, with the Random rule from above, the girls from said 12-episode anime might end up paired off against a bunch of strong girls and lose in the first or second round, while the one who has been doing well for 2-3 years already gets some easy fights and ends up in the final rounds again. Of course, this could be avoided by simply not letting girls who got to the Top 8 or have been in for 2 years in a row enter the next year, just for the sake of having some variety. But that would be too hard.
<ul><li> However, characters from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">Long-Runners</a> or shows with multiple seasons tend to fare worse than newcomers. Characters whose popularity doesn't significantly degrade with each year are rare, and the number of series they originate from is in the single digits.

<ul><li> The Money Cards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound">Bonus Round</a> had contestants betting money based on predicting whether the next card was higher or lower than the one preceding it. Originally, if the next card was the same, it was treated as a wrong call and the contestant lost their bet. Players who went all-in on Aces or deuces frequently wound up getting screwed over by this rule. Late in the Perry run, this was changed to nullify the bet if a push happened. The original "doubles lose" rule returned partway into the 2001 revival and has been enforced ever since. It reared its ugly head in the 2019 revival when one unlucky contestant left the studio with nothing after turning three Aces in a row.
</li><li> The 2001 and 2019 versions have contestants using their in-game money to bet on the Money Cards. In all other previous versions, money earned in the main game was the contestant's to keep.

<ul><li> Sudden Death from 2003 onward where the entire game hinges on getting the number one-answer. With point values already tripled, it more or less boils down to "don't screw up if you ring in too early".
</li><li> The Combs, Dawson '94, Karn and O'Hurley runs had special weeks where teams of divorced couples played against each other. These turn off fans who believe they encourage a mean-spirited atmosphere, especially with the consolation prize in Fast Money turning into a reward for the other team ($5,000 on the Karn era, $10,000 for O'Hurley) if lost. Perhaps ironically, the Harvey version doesn't do them.
</li><li> Fast Money:
<ul><li> No questions are more hated by the fan base than those involving numerical answers, such as those beginning with "On a scale of one to ten..." and "At what [age/time] do[es]...", which have appeared in all versions, most frequently in the Steve Harvey era. With a wide range of answers, fans accuse these of being budget-savers since number one answers to those rarely top 30 points. On a few occasions, contestants have guessed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">numbers outside of the "1-10" range</a> despite such answers never getting <em>any</em> points in the surveys.
</li><li> Since 1999, getting all the number one answers <em>never</em> adds up to more than 200 points. While this is more or less enforced so that the second contestant is required to play, it also makes an already hard bonus round <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">even harder</a>.

</li><li> The final round of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoldenBalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoldenBalls">Golden Balls</a></em> takes <em>Friend or Foe</em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonersDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonersDilemma">Prisoner's Dilemma</a> concept <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> since the stakes are much higher. In place of locking in Friend or Foe, both contestants have to secretly decide whether to split the accumulated bank with their opponent or steal the entire contents. The Split/Steal balls are identical to the Friend/Foe Trust Box where if your opponent chooses Steal, you leave the studio empty-handed regardless of your option. As it is the last ever decision in the show, an <em>entire game</em> could be for naught if both contestants opt to Steal.
</li><li> Two months into Season 31, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy">Jeopardy!</a></em> removed the rule where contestants who finished in a tie for the lead got to keep their earnings and play again as co-champions. Starting in November 2014, all ties are decided with a tiebreaker clue with the winner receiving the day's total and playing on while the loser <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondPlaceIsForLosers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondPlaceIsForLosers">goes home with $2,000</a>. The fan base was not pleased, citing there was nothing wrong with the co-champion rule for the first 30 years the current version of the show had been on the air. They also noticed it as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget">cheap way to save money</a> after the Sony hacking incident which occurred around that time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MervGriffinsCrosswords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MervGriffinsCrosswords">Merv Griffin's Crosswords</a></em> had three Spoiler contestants introduced in round two. If either of the main contestants did not answer correctly on a clue, they could ring in and steal either podiums with a correct answer. One Spoiler could do nothing for the entire game and win by ringing in on the last clue and stealing the leader's score. This happened at least once.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight">The Price Is Right</a></em> has "$X+1" and "$1" bids, where you bet $1 (hence the name) or $1 over another bid. If you're not last, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a> would dictate that the next person bid $X+2 or $2.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobotWars">Robot Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> In its first three series, the arena featured spikes that would pop out of the floor to attack a robot from below. The idea was to attack robots from underneath, where they weren't always armoured, and mess around with the electronics. In practice, however, many robots <em>were</em> protected underneath<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15w8bh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15w8bh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15w8bh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Having a big metal plate bolted to the bottom of the chassis is a great way to lower the center of gravity and stabilize a robot</span>, so the spikes would instead push the robot into the air and, more often than not, flip them over. So many robots were eliminated after being flipped over by the spikes<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16k0w8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note16k0w8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16k0w8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Behemoth, Pitbull, Berserk 2, the list goes on</span> that they were removed from the arena starting with Series 4.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They're returning for the 2016 series, but their location within the arena is much more visible. Whether this is enough to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">rescue them from the Scrappy heap</a> remains to be seen</span>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SupermarketSweep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SupermarketSweep">Supermarket Sweep</a></em>:
<ul><li> Shortly after the Lifetime revival started in 1990, "Market Monsters" were added to the Big Sweep for the purpose of disrupting the contestants' progress. Finding a monster required a contestant to backtrack and shop somewhere else. The staff got the message that this didn't make the Big Sweep exciting at all, and the monsters were thankfully discarded in 1991.
</li><li> The video section added in 1993 which can create headaches if contestants are required to search there in the Mini-Sweep, Big Sweep, and/or Bonus Sweep. The videos didn't seem to be organized alphabetically or by genre, so players could spend valuable seconds spinning the shelves until they found the one they needed.
</li><li> The 2020 revival introduces market specials involving vendors. The contestant has to ask a florist or a barista for an order and must take a time penalty until they are served for a cash bonus. This wouldn't be so bad if the employees didn't dawdle while completing the order, even with what the contestant needed <em>in plain sight</em>. Fans immediately pointed out how unfair it is for contestants to waste precious seconds waiting for a bonus they have no control over. On the first Big Sweep to have one, a contestant had to be stopped from taking the roses she needed so she can wait for the florist to fumble around and pick them up.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TicTacDough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TicTacDough">Tic-Tac-Dough</a></em>:
<ul><li> For a time in 1983, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound">Bonus Round</a> required players to accumulate $1,000 <em>exactly</em>, and going over made finding Tic and Tac the only option to win. Thankfully, that didn't last long.
</li><li> The 1990 revival changed the rules involving tie games. In all previous versions, when a tie game happened, the pot would carry over to the next round with the contestants playing nine new categories. In the revival, the money in the pot reset to 0 in the event of a tie, and the next round would be played for double the stakes. This is hated by fans because it means the second round can potentially be worth <em>less</em> than the first one. The first round can be worth at most $5000, but the second round can be worth at least <em>$3000</em>, and that did happen a few times during the show.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWall">The Wall</a></em> involves contestants answering questions in order to drop balls down the titular wall in a similar fashion to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight">Plinko</a>. Rounds 2 and 3, however, force contestants to drop red balls that make them lose money at the end of the round from the same spots that they dropped green balls at the beginning of the round. This annoys contestants and viewers because they could do well in the trivia portion, but potentially lose all the money they accumulated because of some unlucky drops. On the show's second episode, that's exactly what happened.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune">Wheel of Fortune</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Prize Puzzle, a round where a contestant wins a prize simply by solving the puzzle, is hated by most, if not all of the show's more dedicated fans for two reasons. First, the value of the prizes (they start at $5,000 since 2007, but are usually over $7,000 now) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">often decides who wins the game</a>. Second, the round's gimmick is that the prize in question always has something to do with the puzzle. However, with only three exceptions in the several years the Prize Puzzle has been on the show, the prize is always a trip, usually to a tropical destination. This sometimes leads to a "Phrase" puzzle being a sentence about being on vacation that's not necessarily a common saying (examples include "WHERE DO I PICK UP MY SKI LIFT TICKETS?" and "SOMEBODY INFLATE THE BEACH BALL"), or a puzzle having unnecessary adjectives and other inflations just to make the puzzle seem longer ("TERRIFIC STEEL DRUM MUSIC", "MILES AND MILES OF PRISTINE COASTLINE"). Sometimes, it's painfully obvious that these puzzles are taken from travel promotions and brochures.
</li><li> The Crossword Puzzles, introduced during the final week of Season 33. It is disliked by fans most commonly for the following reasons:
<ul><li> The puzzles have a lower number of consonants than most other puzzles, especially with otherwise-multiple consonants being intersected and counted as one instance, often resulting in lower payouts.
</li><li> There is usually at least one word in the puzzle that's trickier than the others due to having more obscure letters that can't be uncovered from the other words, and sometimes this word only barely fits the given clue. Combined with the above point, Crosswords are rarely solved for more than $2,000. In a January 2017 episode, a puzzle with the clue "It's All Greek to Me" came down to _ETA for the last word. The contestant solved it as FETA, only to be buzzed despite the fitting word. The next contestant revealed the word as Greek letter BETA for the house minimum.
</li><li> The fact that it almost-always appears three times per week meant less appearances of the show's more popular "word play" categories Before &amp; After and Same Name. After many seasons of appearing in almost every episode, Before &amp; After went over a <em>month</em> without being used at all in Season 35.
</li><li> Some fans view it as a cheap <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy">Replacement Scrappy</a> for Same Name or the former "Fill in the Blank" bonus category whenever the clue is something like "Sweet _____" or "_____ Machine". A January 2018 episode had an awkward situation where BLANK was actually one of the words under the clue "_____ Check".
</li></ul></li><li> Team weeks are often disliked due to the game sometimes being slowed down by twice as many interviews and teams conferring over what letter to call. In addition, the house minimum during these weeks is $2,000, which is awfully generous when you consider that the basic Wheel template is only $500-$900 outside of the top dollar value. Even during the Final Spin where $1,000 is added to the value spun, one consonant on any value except the highest one will give you less than said minimum. Also, the first Toss-Up is still worth $1,000 which is not raised to the minimum itself, which results in several games where a team who solves only that puzzle ends up awkwardly having their final score raised to $2,000 at the tail end of the game.
</li><li> The Million Dollar Wedge is hated by some fans, either for the $1,000,000 being way too hard to win and being too gimmicky, replacing the former $100,000 prize, or because of how some casual viewers of the show think the wedge is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>. When somebody makes a bad blunder after picking up the wedge, social media will usually blow up about how the contestant "lost $1 million", as if the grand prize were at stake right then and there.
</li><li> Starting in Season 32, many fans have hated the Rhyme Time category because it often results in a series of randomly-grouped words that just happen to rhyme, even if they are in no way related (e.g. BEES FLEAS &amp; MANATEES, BABOONS AND RACCOONS). As of Season 34, even Pat has begun making fun of this.
</li><li> If one has the Million Dollar Wedge and/or the Wild Card, having Round 4 and beyond go without a Speed-Up since Bankrupt is still in play. It more or less hinges on the staff hoping Bankrupt would be hit, thus denying someone the opportunity to take either or both to the Bonus Round.
</li><li> Disney Weeks are getting hatred from fans due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound">Bonus Round</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">Fake Difficulty</a> spiking during this time, resulting in a much lower win rate than in normal weeks.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</a></em>:
<ul><li> The 50:50 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lifelines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lifelines">lifeline</a> which randomly eliminates two wrong answers, leaving one wrong answer and the correct answer. Many times when a contestant was struggling between two answers, the 50:50 would be used... and the two other answers would be removed. This happened so frequently that many viewers suggested that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">the computer's answer removing was a way to screw the contestant over</a>. This claim started when Norm MacDonald played as a celebrity contestant and when it happened to him, he gave Regis a "What did I tell you?" look.
<ul><li> It did in fact cheat, originally. What answers were removed were always picked in advance when the question was created, and if there was exactly one sucker answer (one that people are likely to think is correct) and a correct answer, it would always leave the sucker answer on the board. Once enough people noticed that it NEVER seemed to help you out, they changed it to actually be random.
</li></ul></li><li> In 2008, the syndicated version added a time limit on questions with the contestant being forced to walk away should the clock hit zero.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note17f458');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note17f458" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note17f458');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Except when using the Double Dip lifeline; failure to give both answers before time runs out sends the contestant down to the last safe haven without the option of walking.</span> This wouldn't have been so bad if not for some major problems.
<ul><li> The time limits themselves. Contestants had <em>15 seconds</em> to answer each question on the first tier, 30 for each on the second and 45 on the first four of the third. The million-dollar question used the entire time banked plus an extra 45 seconds. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">That meant contestants had as much time on the eleventh safe haven question as they had to answer the second-hardest question of the game</a>.
</li><li> The clock started <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeKeepsOnTicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeKeepsOnTicking">the instant the answers were displayed on the screen</a></strong>. This wasted precious seconds as the host read them, longer if the host is a slow reader or fumbles while giving the answers. When Regis returned to host the 10th Anniversary specials, two contestants nearly got timed out because of his reactions to the first question's joke D choices. Steve Harvey, one of the last guest hosts in that era, is commonly cited as a reason for the show axing said format with his speed at reading the answers.
</li><li> The clock format apparently didn't do the budget any favors. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget">$10,000 was left in the prize budget</a> when the last episode of the 2009-10 season was taped. The shuffle format debuted the following season.
</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder23');">    Reality TV </div><div class="folder" id="folder23" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> There are three pre-determined (for legal reasons) non-elimination legs a season on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmazingRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmazingRace">The Amazing Race</a></em>. For the first 4 seasons, there was no penalty for the spared team but the penalty from 5-9 is the most reviled aspect of the shows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">almost two decades on the air</a>. The last place team had to surrender all of their money and werent given any money for the next leg. This put teams in the awkward position of having to beg for things. Sometimes it wasnt so bad because they were in rich countries like Australia and Japan (9) but sometimes it was painfully bad optics to have Americans competing in a show with a million dollar grand prize have to beg in poor countries like Egypt and The Philippines (5). In 6, there was one in Senegal and the spared team felt so bad about having to beg the locals that they just asked the other teams to help them without even trying. Even in a season with quite a few nasty teams, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">they all chipped in to help so they didnt have to beg on the street.</a> This mechanic was gone by 10 and another one has been used ever since 12. The only good thing to come of it is the double leg which came from them having planned an NEL in country where begging is illegal (Hungary) in 6 without realizing it.
