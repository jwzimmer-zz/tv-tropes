Then we have those who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">downright bastards</a> to the kids. Sometimes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">they're not there at all</a>. Or they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalObliviousness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalObliviousness">have no clue what their little ones are up to</a>. Other times <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentsAsPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentsAsPeople">they try to be there but it doesn't always work.</a> And, finally, we have the parents who are there, but for the most part, don't seem at all interested in their child.
</p><p>Parental Neglect happens when the parents are shown not to pay a lot, if any, attention or care to their children for some reason. Maybe they're just busy with work. Maybe they and their children aren't particularly emotionally close, or perhaps they're just obsessed with their own attempts to save the world. Nevertheless, for some reason, their children are not the highest on their agenda.

It should be noted that neglect is in no way a less extreme form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">abuse</a> than the forms on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a> page; extreme neglect in the care of infants has been known to put dampers on mental and cognitive development, and in children it can induce severe psychological damage.

<ul><li> Present to varying degrees in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AccelWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AccelWorld">Accel World</a></em>- Haruyuki's mother has barely any contact with him apart from giving him his lunch money every day, while Kuroyukihime is estranged from her parents after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">threatening her sister with a knife</span> and implies that their relation wasn't exactly close before that. Kuroyukihime cynically notes that the Neurolinkers that children wear from a young age (which is a prerequisite for Brain Burst) serve to enable this sort of hands-off parenting.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: Yukio felt neglected by his parents because he was a silent child, locked in his own fantasies. His parents were deeply disappointed that he wasn't the child they'd imagined having. In revenge, he decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan">drive his parents to suicide</a>. He acts proud of this achievement and that he loved doing what he did, but when Hitsugaya digs a little deeper, Yukio's battered psyche explodes in anger and pain.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACentaursLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACentaursLife">A Centaur's Life</a></em>, Manami's father divides his time between his (part-time) work, his painting and his children, thus often forcing Manami to look after her younger siblings. Manami <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut">politely but firmly</a> tells her father to choose between painting and his job/family, since he can only devote himself to two of those things.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">GT</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Super</a></em>, Goku is usually away from his family because he's either dead or off training. On the upside, Goku has a very loving and respectful relationship with his own sons and granddaughter, despite missing something like (by <em>GT</em>) fifteen years of Gohan's life, thirteen of Goten's, and six of Pan's, due to training or being dead. Gohan himself doesn't seem too disturbed by his daughter going off into space, either, although he and his wife Videl are seen worrying about her when she's getting into fights.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em>: implied to be how Izaya was raised. According to a journal entry by Izaya's father, despite caring for him very much, Izaya's parents were overseas most of the time. As a result, they know very little about their son and appear to be unaware of the majority of the fights he was in post-high school. Also, as his parents weren't around, Izaya was left in charge of his sisters' upbringing. Yes. <em>Those</em> sisters.
</li><li> Riza Hawkeye's father of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> appears to have been so absorbed in his alchemy research he disregarded the well-being of his daughter and the state of his home. Hawkeye said that her father "at least" made sure she got an education. As well, her father's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">tattooing of a massive alchemical array on her back could only be described as physical abuse.</span>
</li><li> Gauron from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Lightnovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Lightnovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em> certainly qualifies in relation to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the twins Yu Fang and Yu Lan</span>. Not surprising, considering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">his personality</a>. He cares little for their physical or mental well-being, and is shown to mainly care about using them for his plans. There are hints and implications that his relationship with them also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry">might not strictly have been a pure, father-daughter kind</a>. He also didn't seem to care that, by having them work in Amalgam, they were being raped and beaten by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Gates</a> (which was apparently happening to them ever since they were young children). Despite all this, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery">still obsessively love him</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullMoon">Full Moon</a></em> has this as Izumi's background from his life as a human. His father died when he was a small child and his mother was constantly bringing men home,even being physically abusive towards Izumi <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> or Leo, as his name back then</span>, which eventually ended in Izumi, as a child, committing suicide by stepping in front of a train. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Goes more into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentsAsPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentsAsPeople">Parents as People</a> category, as it's later shown that the mother was mostly stricken with grief and overall realized herself that she just <em>couldn't</em> be a good mother to Leo to the point that she thinks she has no "right" to stop him from committing suicide and asking for his forgiveness for failing as a mother.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary">Future Diary</a></em>:
<ul><li> While Yukiteru's mother Rea maintains a close relationship with Yukiteru, she is rarely at home because of her work as a video game programmer and approves of Yuno as a potential bride for Yukiteru, even remaining oblivious to Yuno's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">psychotic and dangerous behavior</a>. Really, when your son is on the run from the law, then disappears for a week after being exhonorated and comes back incredibly nervous, you should be at least a little concerned.
</li><li> Also, his father Kurou. Initially, he appears in chapter 30 claiming to just want to check on his son, but it turns out that he has only returned to destroy Yukiteru's diary in order to fulfill a deal with the Eleventh. Despite his only clear desire being to free himself from his debts, he does try to save Yukki when the latter almost falls to his death, but takes the parachute away from Yukki before the tower crumbles soon after. He then stabs Rea when she tries to take him to the police and escapes, though is stabbed to death himself two chapters later by the Eleventh's men, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceDoorSlam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceDoorSlam">just when he'd realised the error of his ways and was trying to atone.</a> <em>Ouch</em>.
</li><li> And then we learn that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Yuno's father</span> wasn't so different. He was a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Workaholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Workaholic">Workaholic</a> to the point that he failed to notice how his wife had become abusive towards their child. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">said kid</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan">got fed up</a></span>
</li></ul></li><li> Out of the girls in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl">Gunslinger Girl</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jean's charge Rico</span>, was a victim of this. Her parents simply abandoned her in an hospital due to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">very weak health</a> and she languished away there until the Agency took her in.
</li><li> Giorno Giovanna from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureVentoAureo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureVentoAureo">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Vento Aureo</a></em> had an extremely bad childhood. First of all, his biological father, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventurePhantomBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventurePhantomBlood">a hundred year-old</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders">British vampire</a>, didn't even know he existed after having a one-night stand with his mother, and the only reason Giorno even knows he exists is due to a <em>single</em> photo. His biological mother was an extremely neglectful parent who left her extremely young son alone in the house to party, and later married a man who seemed nice at first, but turned out to be an extremely physically abusive step-father for Giorno, along with being a drunkard. In short, Giorno somehow managed to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">Parental Abandonment</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect">Parental Neglect</a> AND <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a> <em>at the same time.</em>
</li><li> Hayate of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler">Hayate the Combat Butler</a></em> has incredibly neglectful parents—they spend all their money on gambling, and steal from Hayate to fund their habits, eventually selling his organs to some "very nice people" to pay off their debts. They also stole a ring from him when he was a child <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> given to him by his girlfriend/mentor Athena as a symbol of her love for him. He desperately wanted to trust and love them, but Athena argued that there was no good reason for him to do so, and she eventually dumped Hayate when she found out that his parents sold the ring at a pawn shop.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HoneyHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HoneyHunt">Honey Hunt</a></em> has the protagonist's (Yura) famous celebrity parents, Yukari and Takayuki. For one thing, Yura is judged a disappointment by others because she is continuously compared to her celebrity parents and she is used to people trying to get close to her for the sole purpose of getting to possibly meet Yukari and Takayuki. For another thing, Yukari is hardly at home and is very selfish. In all of her interviews, she lies and says that she and Yura are close and spend much time together as a result of Takayuki being abroad so often, when in reality, she is a cold and distant parent. Also, immediately after showing up after being away from home for about a half a month, Yukari coldly announces that she and Yura's father are getting divorced before telling Yura that she can go wherever she wants. Also, while Takayuki was having an affair she was having one of her own with Yura's neighbor and crush, Shinsuke. When Yura finds out about the affair Yukari's response is to smile, declare that Shinsuke likes her more than Yura, that she's going to allow Shinsuke to live with her in a mansion she had bought, and that Takayuki had a baby with his mistress so neither he nor Yukari will have time to look after Yura anymore.

The two of them even agreed on a rule with each other that they would stay married as long as they hid their own adulterous affairs. After she decided to divorce Takayuki because the press found out about his affair, however, it is shown that she has no intentions of taking care of Yura and merely cared about repairing her image in the eyes of the public because they had originally thought she was the "ideal mom".

</li><li> Considering it's heavily implied he didn't see his own orphaned godson for the first 13 years of his life, Jiraiya certainly appears neglectful to the point of being abusive. He gets (somewhat) better after their initial meeting, though, if you call spending his godson's life savings on booze and hookers an improvement. But <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">supplementary materials</a> reveal Jiraiya's reason for not being with Naruto when he was growing up: He was keeping Minato's old enemies in check, tracking down Orochimaru, and tracking Akatsuki. He was keeping all threats from <em>outside</em> the village from getting to Naruto. It doesn't stop fans from resenting him, anyways, not helped by the fact that Jiraiya is fairly wealthy and could easily have hired tutors and caretakers to raise him, and no reason is given why he didn't even arrange for a proper foster family to care for his godson.

Tree Hugger was loving but wildly irresponsible, often leaving her son alone while she went to hippie retreats, while Zephyr never had any real presence in his son's life, feeling parenting would "cramp his style".

He tries to use his clever ways to gain riches. He gains much of his wealth through trickery and deceit and loses it the same way. Sir Peter takes pride in Ella for being a brave, sassy child. Once he gets to know his daughter, he notes their resemblance, laughs at her attitude, and seems to grow somewhat fond of her. Yet, he deals little with his daughter and is more concerned for his business than her well-being. They have a distant relationship, as Ella acknowledges his corrupt, greedy nature and finds it unpleasant—especially during his attempts to force her to marry. He marries Dame Olga because of her wealth and cares little when Dame Olga forces Ella to work as a servant.

She never wanted to grow up— [] the only reason they got married was because she accidentally fell pregnant with me—a fact she likes to remind me of whenever we have an argument. And now that I am just a few months away from being legally classed an adult, she feels freer than she has in years. Dave already has a young family of his own. He has made it very clear that he doesnt want to take on someone elses. And so she shrewdly keeps him away, only bringing him back to the house when everyone is asleep or out at school. With Dave she has reinvented herself—a young woman caught up in a passionate romance. She dresses like a teenager, spends all her money on clothes and beauty treatments, lies about her age, and drinks, drinks, drinks—to forget that youth and beauty are behind her, to forget that Dave has no intention of marrying her, to forget that at the end of the day she is just a forty-five-year-old divorcée in a dead-end job with five unwanted children.</em>

They casually make a phone call to ask if anyone's seen him and, upon being told he was seen getting into someone's car, they decide he's "probably" gone to a friend's house and ignore it. Several weeks later, he still hasn't been found—and the parents continue to do nothing. Even when they're informed that their son's body was discovered, they can't be bothered to identify him (saying that if the police think it's him, "that's good enough for us") and then get annoyed that they're expected to bury him themselves. Their only reaction to being told that a friend has confessed to the murder is to sigh and resolve to "have a word" the next time they see him.
<ul><li> This sketch is a homage to a similar sketch by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VictoriaWood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VictoriaWood">Victoria Wood</a> about a teenage champion swimmer who's attempting to cross the English Channel.

<ul><li> The victim in "Indifference" was technically killed by her mother, but her father is also held responsible for his role in the events, which included not even checking on his child when he came in to find her bleeding on the floor (in addition to other things, like getting his wife hooked on the drugs that triggered her violent impulses).
</li><li> "God Bless The Child" involves a variation. The parents at the center of the case did love their daughter and generally cared for her, but because of their religious beliefs, they didn't seek medical assistance when she became seriously ill, leading to her death from a treatable infection.
</li><li> The mother in "Aria" is an extreme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom">Stage Mom</a> who completely neglects her daughters' well-being because she's more concerned about them having successful acting careers, eventually leading one of the daughters to commit suicide because she can't take it anymore.

Even after she's caught and arrested, this is her primary consideration.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jo:</strong> Tell my dad everything. He'll come to my cell now. He'll listen to me. However long it takes.
</div></li><li> Pops up occasionally in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em>, though it's usually a secondary issue to a more egregious crime.
<ul><li> One of the victims in "Bullseye" is a girl whose mother and stepfather spend all their time playing video games and ignoring her. It's eventually revealed that the mother's neglect is due to a severe mental disorder that causes her not to recognize the girl as her child, but the stepfather is perfectly in his right mind and just doesn't care.
</li><li> "Institutional Fail" involves a child who died from neglect, despite the fact that she was supposedly getting regular home visits from the department of child services. This leads to a discovery of serious systemic problems in the department.
</li><li> "Bang" features a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a> lawyer who wants to have as many children as possible and accomplishes this by impregnating women and then convincing them to carry their babies to term, only to leave them and move on to the next potential mother almost as soon as the baby is born, sending money but never actually being a part of his children's lives. Elliot tells him flat-out that he has no idea what it actually means to be a father.

Tyr'Nar takes advantage of Kevin's distant relationship with his father to convince Kevin to help him. Kevin's mother Danielle admits that she likewise spends far more time with Josh than she does with Kevin.
</li><li> In "Seeds of Destruction", Linda Andrews' mother continually neglected her when she was a child as she was more interested in sleeping with men than in being a parent.

Among other things, he was often gone for days or weeks at a time, leaving Sam and Dean holed up in weekly motels and schools, and never spent Christmas with his sons. The most stand-out example however is when he leaves his nine- and five-year-old alone in a motel room with a loaded shotgun for <em>days</em> while he's hunting a monster that preys on children.

This resulted in the largest, bloodiest war the galaxy had ever seen. Most of them had better relationships with their adoptive parents than the Emperor. Part of the reason is the Primarchs come from very different culture and other other part is the Emperor is <em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss">old</a></strong></em>. And because of that he no longer has the same concept of time or relationships as everyone else. For example, The Emperor tells his religious zealot of son Lorgar Aurelian to cease his worship of his father as a god. To The Emperor, once should have been enough. To Lorgar, his most holy Father had told him <em>once</em> in a hundred years. What the Emperor did after, while well meaning, didn't help Lorgar in the slightest.

Alex Shephard is practically forgotten by his parents, who are very distant with him, giving him little to no attention at all while absolutely doting on his much younger brother, Josh, even giving the child a family ring that has a great deal of meaning to it. The boy acts like a brat about it to his brother, evidently loving to rub how he's their favorite in his older brother's face. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This ends badly.</span> While Alex is jealous, to his credit he does still love his family and does everything he can, even descending into what seems like hell itself, to find and rescue his brother. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It turns out his family had a reason for being so distant-every fifty years, the townspeople had to sacrifice one of their children in order to appease their God and keep all hell from breaking loose. Alex's parents purposely remained distant with him, not wanting him to experience or learn compassion, love or happiness, so the inevitable death of their son would be easier on all of them. Alex's parents seem to realize how wrong this was, however, as they beg for his forgiveness before their deaths-though the realization of how wrong they were seems to only come after Alex accidentally killed Josh out of jealousy brought on by the aforementioned ring.</span>

Unlike most examples, the reasons for this are explored and Dojima is portrayed as a good guy who just doesn't know how to be a parent. Specifically, his wife was killed in a hit-and-run accident, and he's been a workaholic ever since, trying to solve the case while simultaneously running from his daughter because he's afraid of failing her.

Frandar reluctantly accepted and led them to victory. Despite this, due to being considered "red with blood" by the Yokudan people, Frandar, Divad, and the other Ansei chose to self-exile from Yokuda to Tamriel. Frandar and Divad would finally bond there, and Divad would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather">wipe out the giant goblins</a> of Hammerfell after Frandar fell in battle to them.

She often has to leave Gwen alone in her crib for hours on end in order to find ingredients for the drugs she makes to keep the Bobbies off her back, and she commissions a feeder from Lionel Castershire to ensure that she can leave Gwen for longer stretches of time without having to come back. Sally absolutely <em>hates</em> this, acknowledges that what she's doing is cold and harsh, but also that she has no other choice.

His "mother" Princess Bubblegum, the ruler of an entire kingdom, apparently didn't want to handle the responsibility of raising a brain-damaged, failed science experiment, so she stuck him in a castle to be raised by servants in near total isolation from the outside world. It's rather common.

<ul><li> Timmy's parents are quite neglectful and extremely selfish. They do love him though; they're more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">man children</a> than truly evil abusers. Still, there are times when they put Timmy's happiness after their own, and in the "Wishology" trilogy, they fail to notice he's been in Fairy World for an extended period of time, and don't notice they forgot to take him on <em>two</em> family vacations. It speaks volumes when, in part one, Timmy shrugs off the fact that they don't remember they have a son. The mother has even openly spent Timmy's college fund on stuff for herself when viewing the home shopping channel. Also, as a one-line throwaway gag when they notice "fly head Timmy" eating garbage, they refer to how they frequently forget to make dinner for three people (they only make dinner for themselves).
</li><li> As bad as Timmy's parents are, Remy Buxaplenty's are even worse (and the reason why he has a Godfather in the first place). They spend a minute a day with their son <em>(literally timed down to the second)</em> and don't even remember his name. If "Remy Rides Again" is any indication, they've only gotten worse: when Timmy tried to fix this situation by taking away their wealth and stranding the family on a desert island so they'd spend time with Remy, they just gathered riches again (his father struck oil and his mother converted the island to a tropical resort) and returned to ignoring Remy.
</li><li> Timmy himself will become a neglectful parent toward his own children (Tommy and Tammy) in the future, as a possible side effect of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">Laser-Guided Amnesia</a> we all know he's going to get when he gets older. He says that the purpose of the time capsule was so that he'd remember Vicky's atrocities to prevent his fate from happening to his future kids... so said memory loss might have wiped the motive away too.
</li><li> In general, many of the children Fairy Godparents look after are like this. They only go to children who are miserable and unhappy, and many of the ones we see have Parental Neglect who make them that way.

Stewie is almost always left alone with Brian while Chris seems to barely exist. In fact, Peter has gone as far as to say that he can't stand his kids. Nowhere is this trope shown better than in the episode where Stewie gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">horrible head injury</a> that only gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NauseaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NauseaFuel">worse</a> as he is not taken to the hospital (Meg and Chris try to hide his injury in fear that they'll get in trouble). When Peter finds out, he <em>commends</em> the children on trying to hide the problem, and reveals that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">he did the same to each of them when they were younger</a> ("Sometimes to shut you up, sometimes just because the Patriots lost").

Lois then suggests they hide it and pin the blame on someone else. That's if the kids are <em>lucky</em>, by the way. Usually, they are the victims of abuse of all four categories (well, all four for Meg, at least).
</li><li> Some of the parents in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> seem to be universally neglectful:
<ul><li> Philip Fry's parents are at first mentioned to be quite neglectful. Fry is pleased he won't see them again when he arrives in the future, and it is later said they kept him out of school as they thought it a "waste of taxpayer's money". However, we later see them in flashback, and whilst they do have their moments of neglect (Mr. Fry is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">Conspiracy Theorist</a> and Mrs. Fry is more focused on watching the game than discliping her sons) they are shown to love and care for both of their sons. The family are upset when Fry "disappears" and do look for him, and never get over his disappearance. It is later explained that Fry knew he would never see them again after waking up in 3000 and tried to convince himself this was a good thing to spare his own feelings.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Fry:</strong> There's not one thing about this place that I missed. <em>[sees his dog, Seymour]</em> Seymour! I forgot about you. Aw, I missed your stinky breath so much. Maybe I do kind of miss this place. Maybe I just convinced myself I hated it because I knew I could never come back. You know, boy, this was the last time I ever saw my family.
</div></li><li> And then there's Cubert's "father", Hubert Farnsworth, who shows very little interest in Cubert beyond the fact that he is a successful experiment.
</li><li> In one episode, Fry is fed up with suffering this trope from Farnsworth (technically Farnsworth is <em>his</em> descendant, but Fry views him as the closest to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a> he can get). This leads to him seeking out Farnsworth's parents and finding loving parental figures in them, only to learn that Farnsworth himself resents them for ignoring <em>him</em> throughout most of his youth. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Subverted when it's discovered that far from neglecting him, they stayed up with him every night when he suffered night terrors, which left them too exhausted to spend time with him during the day.

The deal is totally inverted with Olga: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom">excessive and asphyxiating attention from Miriam and Bob</a> shaped her into an insecure, hysteric, overachieving, whiny <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">doormat</a> who breaks down to a ridiculous degree if she makes a wrong step. In her own words, <em>"[Helga,] you're <strong>lucky</strong> they don't even notice you."</em> To put this in perspective, one episode had Helga change Olga's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBGrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBGrade">grade in a class to a B+</a>, causing Olga to lock herself in her room for the better part of a week. She did it expecting to have some attention for herself... but the parents <em>still</em> flocked to Olga, which spurred her to ultimately confess to Helga how sick she was of the whole deal. This is however played straight when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">Aesop Amnesia</a> kicks in: Both Helga and Olga <em>completely forget</em> their heart to heart, Olga starts playing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">Stepford Smiler</a> <em>completely straight</em> and Helga <em>again</em> thinks Olga <em>enjoys</em> all the attention (since ever since that <em>one</em> time, she hasn't shown she doesn't like it).

Dib seems to have responded to this by becoming similarly obsessed with his own pursuits and largely indifferent towards his father, while his sister Gaz seems eager for his company and attention. However, more recently in the comic books and in the TV movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZimEnterTheFlorpus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZimEnterTheFlorpus">Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus</a></em>, Professor Membrane has been depicted more positively, trying to do his work as fast he can to spend at least some moments with his children and even assuring Dib that he has always been proud of him despite their differences.

</li><li> Ron's parents in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em> are barely involved in his life, and barely involve Ron in their decisions either, to the point that the major revelations in their family, moving to Europe in the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">movie</a>, and adopting a baby, are revealed to Ron with his parents saying "This is our way of telling you..." after he walks home from school to find a "SOLD" sign on his house, and then by finding that his room has been changed into a nursery. Ron repeatedly gets parental-type advice from his angry teacher, Mr. Barkin and it seems that Kim's family play a bigger role in his life than his own. They also repeatedly dump his baby sister on him so they can go out. This is all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Comparing the family state of Ron, an only child for most of the series, to Kim, with brothers and extremely involved and supportive parents is quite jarring, and shows up a few times in the show itself, including Ron's "freakout" at losing "everything he ever cares about"</a> which amounts to Kim and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LocalHangout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LocalHangout">fast food joint</a>. Ron does get a chance at payback when he gets to reveal to his parents that his adopted baby sister Hana is in fact a mystical ninja messiah baby as she innocently wreaks havoc all over the kitchen. When his parents ask why he didn't tell them before? "This <em>is</em> my way of telling you."
<ul><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason">Post-Script Season</a> episode, this neglect haunts Mr. Stoppable again when Ron is given a school assignment to write an essay about his hero, and Ron doesn't take him into consideration at <em>all.</em> He then spends the rest of the episode trying to prove to his son that he can be a hero, from doing volunteer work to stopping the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek">Villain of the Week</a> from doing any more harm to him.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em> shows that that Avatar Aang and Toph Beifong, main characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>, were neglectful to their kids:
<ul><li> More specifically, Aang neglected Bumi and Kya, the older son and daughter he had with his wife Katara, in favor of his youngest son, Tenzin, who was the only Airbender child in the family — albeit this was to make sure the Air Nation would make a comeback and eventually restore balance to the world. This seriously damaged Tenzin's relationships with his brother and sister, since they came to resent and mistreat him for being "the favorite" in their father's eyes.
</li><li> Meanwhile, Toph chose to be very hands-off with her two daughters, Lin and Suyin, so that they would have the freedom to do whatever they want, something Toph herself did not have growing up. However, expecting the two girls to basically raise themselves ultimately blew up in Toph's face as it left both girls feeling unloved by their mother and made them more desperate for her attention, which led Lin to becoming a Metalbending police officer like Toph in the hopes of gaining some approval (only to be given a cold shoulder for it), while Suyin became a teenage criminal who ended up scarring Lin's face, albeit accidentally, when Lin broke up a robbery Suyin took part in. Toph covered the whole thing up and sent Suyin to live with her grandparents instead of to jail, which hurt Lin even more and resulted in seriously damaging Toph and Suyin's relationships with her, ultimately causing an estrangement that lasted well over thirty years.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse">Metalocalypse</a></em>:
<ul><li> It's explicitly stated that Skwisgaar's standing as the world's fastest guitarist (in the world's greatest band) is due to the sheer neglect of his mother, who was also Miss Sweden 1956.
</li><li> Pickles; his parents <em>still</em> haven't noticed that he's a musically multi-talented billionaire. Their neglect drove him to run away from home, buy a guitar in a pawn shop, and start a hugely successful glam rock band. Part of it is because Pickles is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavourite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavourite">The Un-Favourite</a>, as they pay more attention and lavish more praise on his deadbeat brother Seth (who actually works <em>for</em> Pickles by season three).
</li></ul></li><li> Gabriel Agreste in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug">Miraculous Ladybug</a></em> manages the impressive feat of combining this trope with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplarParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplarParent">Knight Templar Parent</a>. He obsessively micromanages every aspect of his son Adrien's life, but he's never <em>there</em> for any of it, working through video calls and his assistant Nathalie. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And he spends most of his free time as the supervillain Hawk Moth, causing problems that his son often gets caught up in.</span>
</li><li> Doughy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Latchkey</a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MoralOrel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MoralOrel">Moral Orel</a></em>'s parents look and act like teenagers, always giving him money to go away so they can have time to themselves (despite that they apparently get plenty of it and Doughy's not that high maintenance). He's quite envious of Orel and his father, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">though probably not too aware of their situation</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em>: Dr. Doofenshmirtz's backstories often have him as the victim of this... His mom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">ignored him in favor of his brother Roger</a> and his dad preferred <em>a dog</em> (which he called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice">Only Son</a></em>) instead of him.
</li><li> It is necessary for the show to function and isn't taken seriously, but none of the parents on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em> seem to keep too keen an eye on their infant children, who normally wander off into situations that could kill them. This is particularly bad in Season 1, where they sometimes leave their kids with Grandpa, who falls asleep while telling the babies a story. The worst offender is the Season 1 episode "Touchdown Tommy," where all the dads are watching a big football game. Because they are too busy watching football, the babies have covered the living room in chocolate milk, and Didi and Betty are rightfully pissed when they get back.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated">Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated</a></em>:
<ul><li> It features the gang's parents in this light. The gang's parents seem to put their happiness before their kids. Velma's mom (as shown in a picture) cares a lot more about her horses than her own daughter, Shaggy's parents think of him as an embarrassment, Fred's dad was thrilled at the idea of his son dying at the hands of the cicada monster, and Daphne's mother told her right to her face that sometimes she wishes they had a boy instead. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Though if you think of it, this could explain why in earlier series the parents never seemed to care that their kids were mystery solving all over the place</a>.
</li><li> ALL the parents of Crystal Cove fit in this trope. When their children are "spookified," they abandon them!
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mayor Jones just has to be <em>the worst</em> out of them. For starters, he's not Fred's real dad. Fred's real father and mother aren't much better, though they are at least doing it for Fred's own good...once the curse corrupts them so that Fred's own good no longer matters to them, they stop the neglecting and pursue a straight up <em>enemy</em> relationship with their son!</span>
</li><li> Velma's mother gradually became better than the other parents and played more of a supportive role towards Velma and the gang, to the point that she would help them solve mysteries when they needed advice on the supernatural.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> This can happen, often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>. Homer, especially is too involved in his own schemes, or too distracted by Bart to pay enough attention to Lisa and Maggie.
<ul><li> And certainly Homer's parents for different reasons: Mona was too busy chaining herself to things in protest, and Abe was just not particularly emotionally invested in Homer.
</li></ul></li><li> Ned Flanders's parents were <em>intentionally</em> neglectful. As beret-wearing beatniks, they believed that children ought to be free and unrestrained and thus provided no guidance or discipline at all. This resulted in young Ned being incredibly violent and destructive. After some time, they finally gave in and had to seek psychiatric help to calm Ned down. On the other hand, as an adult, Ned is an outstanding father.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>: For as much as she qualifies as Pink Diamond's "mother", White Diamond is notably absent from nearly all scenes of the Diamonds, including the murder trial of Pink's alleged murderer; the other Diamonds themselves never acknowledge her. The only time she intervened at all was to help Yellow and Blue unleash the Corrupting Light on Earth after Pink's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">alleged</span> shattering. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When she eventually reunites with Pink (or rather, the person she perceives as Pink) she is incredibly dismissive, referring to the Gem war as Pink's "latest little game" before whisking "Pink Diamond" off to her room. It's even possible that White was outright abusive towards her "daughter", given her Pearl's battered appearance and robotic mannerisms, and the fact Blue and Yellow Diamond openly fear her. In any case, she certainly doesn't care enough about Pink to attend the ball celebrating her return, sending <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell">her Pearl</a> instead.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em>, Norman Osborn isn't abusive of Harry, but he does neglect his son in favor of work and in his pursuit of Spider-Man. This all changes when he becomes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Green Goblin</a></span> though.
</li><li> Pretty much the main point of FX's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Unsupervised" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Unsupervised">Unsupervised</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em>:
<ul><li> Dr. Venture seems to have absolutely no interest in his sons, and treats them as walking organ banks and largely not caring if they live or die because he can clone them ad nausea. His own father has been shown as unintentionally emotionally traumatizing young Rusty through his womanizing ways. This changes (a little) in season 4, when Dr. Venture begins grooming Dean to follow in his footsteps. On the other hand, he does <em>not</em> take it well when Hank turns into a rebellious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmoTeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmoTeen">Emo Teen</a>.
</li><li> Its been said that Jonas Venture refused to let his son wear anything but shorts until he left for college, so him saying he doesnt want to go on an adventure was simply out of the question. Even though he writes it off as a phase the fact that he allows Dean to stay home says a lot, like the fact that he has shown a lot more interest in their safety since he cant clone them anymore ignoring it might just be his way of showing that he does care.
</li><li> Rusty's father didn't seem all that concerned about Rusty's desire to live a normal life, instead insulting him for being ungrateful for all the opportunities of being a Boy Adventurer, which include being locked at home or being dragged all over the world, getting kidnapped with great frequency.
</li><li> The whole series implies that the parents of boy adventurers are by nature very neglectful. Which when you think about what kind of dad would let his son wander around in mummy tombs or look for serial killers, is a good deconstruction. There are even therapy groups for this sort of thing that include parodies of Robin (Wonderboy, who has abandonment issues from his adopted parent Captain Sunshine), the Hardy Boys (who were implied to have actually <em>killed</em> their father but were acquitted from charges in court), "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JonnyQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JonnyQuest">Action Johnny</a>" who has deep, deep issues and is a serious drug addict, and Astroboy (Ro-Boy); not much is mentioned about him, but given the original Astroboy was sold to a circus by his own "father", we can imagine he suffered a similar backstory).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> Superman's reticence to spend any time with or forge any sort of emotional connection with Superboy (a clone of Supes created by the Light) is portrayed as this (never mind that SB isn't actually his son and everyone just expects him to go along with it without taking his feelings into consideration). Subverted in the following season, where he's come to grips with that (saving the world always works wonders with him) and adopted Superboy as a little brother.
</li><li> Analyzed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>, Scootaloo's parents <em>finally</em> show up after at least a three year absence <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>. Very much a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentsAsPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentsAsPeople">Parents as People</a> as they're not portrayed as bad parents in the slightest and they and their daughter love each other very much, and it's actually their attempt at averting this that causes problems: they want to bring Scootaloo with them so they can be together and she is upset that this will separate her from her friends and that her parents are trying to dictate her life after being gone so long.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ElenaOfAvalor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ElenaOfAvalor">Elena of Avalor</a></em>, Carla has been raised by her father Victor for the past ten years after her mother Ash left them in promise of finding a way to turn them all into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer">malvagos</a>. Ash falls out of contact with them after three years, so the lack of communication causes her family to believe she's dead, when in truth, she had just gotten carried away with her malvago training. When she finally returns, she blames her husband for depriving her of watching Carla grow up because the plan was for them to wait for her. Meanwhile, she dotes on her daughter, but there are hints through the next few episodes that she seems to prioritize power over her... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which eventually culminates in Carla almost getting badly hurt from one of her schemes, to which Victor tries to get him and Carla to retire from evil, only for Ash to petrify him for arguing with her one too many times. When Ash asks Carla to come with her, unsurprisingly, Carla tells her to screw off. Though Ash is initially shocked by this, she immediately leaves her behind at the mercy of our heroes.</span>
