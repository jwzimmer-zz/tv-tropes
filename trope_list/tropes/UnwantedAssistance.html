The problem is, sometimes this help turns out to be rather unhelpful. Depending on the situation, it can be anywhere from irritating to downright dangerous, for the "helper" <em>and</em> the "helpee". As such, this situation can have several different outcomes, ranging from simple annoyance on the part of the people being inconvenienced to extremely dire consequences that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">involve a lot of people getting killed</a>.

While he is forced to obey the kids while they are contracted, he is extremely cynical and cruel, and will often "forget" to give out certain pieces of information, all because he loves to see the kids agonize and cry. Extra points for actually helping the kids exclusively when he knew it would hurt them more than it would help them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutureGPXCyberFormula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutureGPXCyberFormula">Future GPX Cyber Formula</a></em>: Earlier in the series, Asurada tries to teach its partner Hayato how to drive properly, but he ignores his advice, and he even tries to <em>destroy</em> Asurada when the machine indirectly caused the crash involving him and his friend Johji (which resulted in the latter's retirement from Cyber Formula).

He also helps train Ichika on using a rifle, and seems a bit too friendly, causing the girls to get quite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">jealous</a>.

Eventually, of course, he gets so tired that he has to give in, and Shiron transforms massively.

Whenever she managed to shove him off, the War Beast had recovered and she had to begin again. The ironical part is Boss thought he was being chivalrous, charming and kind instead of an offensive and hindering nuisance.

In one early episode, in fact, Yuma gets so angry at Astral that he tells him he will <em>not</em> do what Astral tells him to do from this point. Astral then starts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReversePsychology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReversePsychology">purposely giving Yuma ''bad'' advice</a>, and as expected, Yuma does the exact opposite, which turns out to be what he has to do in order to win.

Tomoko definitely wishes she'd <em>stop</em> doing that.

Katakuri, who had been deeply enjoying the battle and sees Luffy as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>, is infuriated and angrily tells her to stay out of his duel.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BNABrandNewAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BNABrandNewAnimal">Brand New Animal</a></em>: When Michiru discovers her old friend Nazuna is acting as the prophet for a growing cult, she assumes that she was forced into the position and works to help her escape, despite Nazuna's insistence that she's fine and that Michiru shouldn't get involved. Michiru's efforts eventually lead to a meeting with the city's mayor, which Nazuna decides to use to speed up the process of getting her cult seen as a legitimate religion. When Michiru tries to call Nazuna out for using her, Nazuna points out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">she spent every conversation explicitly telling Michiru that she shouldn't do anything</a>.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a></em> article <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_19899_5-popular-forms-charity-that-arent-helping.html">"5 Popular Forms of Charity (That Aren't Helping)"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has several examples that fall under this:
<ul><li> Participation in awareness campaigns in general makes people less likely to give money to charity, as they feel that they've already done their part. Breast cancer awareness campaigns are especially bad with this, because, in order to make themselves more marketable, they often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedMarketing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedMarketing">misrepresent the problem</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSells">focusing on young, sexy women</a> instead of the older women who are the most likely to get breast cancer.
</li><li> Clothing donations crippled the textile industries in African nations, which couldn't hope to compete with floods of free clothing donated by the West. They're also incredibly inefficient, taking up space on transports that could go to food and medicine.
</li><li> Choosing a charity based on its overhead (i.e. how much is spent on administrative costs and bureaucracy versus actual aid) can cause the exact problem that it is supposed to prevent. As it turns out, the money "wasted" on overhead is actually necessary for keeping the charity operating smoothly, and charities with low overhead costs are typically a lot less competent due to them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingCorners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingCorners">Cutting Corners</a> in their work.
</li><li> Earmarking the money you donate so that it goes to a particular cause can lead to the more high-profile causes getting more attention at the expense of others. After the 2004 tsunami, charities started building McMansions in Indonesia in order to do <em>something</em> with all the money that had been earmarked for housing, and Japan received so much aid after the 2011 earthquake/tsunami that they had to tell aid workers to stop coming in.
</li><li> Volunteering to do aid work overseas is usually a bad idea unless you are properly trained for what it is you're doing <em>and</em> you know the local language and customs. There are tons of people already there who can do the work you're doing, and you'll wind up getting in the way and consuming food and water that could go to the people you're trying to help. This is especially true in the critical few days and weeks after a major natural disaster where many thousands of people are in need of rescue (case in point, the thousands trapped beneath rubble after the 2010 Haiti earthquake). Unless you're trained for this sort of thing specifically, you'll just waste everyone's time.
</li></ul></li><li> Snooker phenomenon Ronnie O'Sullivan once insisted that the referee measure whether a re-spotted ball would fit on its mark (which it clearly didn't), which necessitated laboriously removing and marking several other balls. Although the ref dutifully completed the manoeuvre, she did <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">remark</a>, "Ronnie, I could do this a lot faster if you weren't helping me!" when he wouldn't stop commenting on her performance.
</li><li> In the 2012 Abu Dhabi GP, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a> driver Kimi Räikkönen got a little fed up with his engineer updating him over the pit to car radio first telling him to "leave me alone, I know what I'm doing", and then when being reminded to keep his tyres up to temperature during a safety car period; "Yes, I'm doing all the tyres. You don't have to remind me every second". Räikkönen proved he didn't need the help by winning the race, but saw the funny side by <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/20267305">distributing T-shirts with his statements on to the team<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Geraldo Rivera in 2003 tried to help viewers at home understand where he and the troops with him were by sketching out a map in the sand, showing the objective, then showing where he was in relation to it. Arguments have been made on both sides of the matter - that the enemy was unlikely to be able to find the troops based off of this, or that his actions led to many deaths by alerting the enemy to the army's actions. It is generally agreed to have been a dumb maneuver on Rivera's part.
</li><li> Elon Musk's attempt to use a submarine to save the children trapped in a cave in Thailand was waved off by professionals who had the situation handled, and was largely seen as him trying to capitalize on the trapped kids as part of a publicity stunt for his company. His meltdown on Twitter afterward certainly didn't help.
</li><li> Deliberately used in the lead-up to the 1953 coup in Iran, where the communist Tedah party threw support toward the Prime Minister (also the target of MI6/CIA propaganda) in order to discredit him further, since he actively and vocally <em>opposed</em> policies they wanted to enact.
</li><li> Police, firefighters, and EMT personnel have a strict stance against assistance from civilians for exactly this reason. In addition to being a distraction you can also be a liability and, if injured, will become another casualty <em>they</em> now need to assist. Honestly the best thing you can do once these people arrive is tell them what you know (if they even need that) and promptly get out of their way and let them get to work.
</li><li> Election campaigns usually feature messages from a wide range of organizations supporting a favored candidate. This can be counterproductive if the outside messages come across as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">dishonest</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">absurd</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanPanicNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanPanicNow">scare-mongering</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdHominem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdHominem">personal attacks</a>, etc, forcing the candidate to distance himself from the mess.
</li><li> The organization Autism Speaks is infamous among actual autistics, as it promotes unscientific claims about autistics, promotes 'therapies' designed to mold autistic people to be more 'neurotypical' (ABA was created by the same person who created <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CureYourGays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CureYourGays">conversion therapy</a></em>, using the <em>same</em> underlying principles, <strong>and</strong> has been shown to leave <a class="urllink" href="https://www.scienceopen.com/document?vid=4e5163dc-da6e-4952-9797-882ef5c0b2b2">autistic individuals at greater<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311908.2019.1641258">risk of suffering from PTSD<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), uses scare tactics to make the parents of autistic children view them as a burden, AND has zero input from actual autistic people.
</li><li> One behavior found in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a> is to insist on helping their child with something or to do something for the child without asking first, only to later complain about the effort the help took and/or use the event to make the child do something for them in return out of a sense of obligation. The behavior lasting long enough can result in the child becoming wary of any help offered by their parents. Another variation of this is when the parent insists on helping the child with something despite the child saying they don't want help, then scolding the child when the child isn't effusively grateful for the parent's "help".
</li><li> In feminist circles, this is known as "mansplaining": a man approaches a woman, assumes she knows nothing about an activity she's doing or topic she's discussing, and explains every single detail to her under the assumption that she knows less than him, even when she makes it clear she's knowledgable about the subject. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgement">This is a very controversial topic, so let's leave it at that.</a>

</li><li> This is a recurring problem <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabledMeansHelpless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabledMeansHelpless">for disabled people</a>. A lot of people have no problem just grabbing the handles of someone's wheelchair and moving them or manhandling a blind person to point them in the right direction. One woman <a class="urllink" href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/30/woman-adds-spikes-to-wheelchair-to-stop-strangers-pushing-her-uninvited-10646776/">resorted to putting spikes on her wheelchair handles<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to stop strangers from trying to move her.
</li><li> For people who enjoy doing puzzles, which can include assembling items, about the <em>last</em> thing they want is for someone else to complete the task for them - or to keep offering unwanted suggestions on how to complete said puzzle. After all, part of the thrill of doing a puzzle is being able to figure solutions out yourself. If they should get stumped somewhere along the way - they can look at the manual instructions themselves, thank you very much!
</li><li> More particular eaters will be quite annoyed by someone else filling their plate, especially if they do so without even asking what they'd like. Furthermore, attempting to order for them at a restaurant without asking what they want is a deal-breaker for them. Of course, this can even be potentially lethal to people with food allergies!
</li><li> This was one of many things that waylaid the Second Pacific Squadron: they got a message from High Command that reinforcements were on the way, and they should sit tight and wait for their salvation before engaging the Japanese. Rozhestvensky, the admiral of the fleet in question, was fully aware that the Second Squadron essentially consisted of every ship available at the time that had even a hope of contributing against the Japanese—hence, the <em>Third</em> Squadron was likely to consist of the absolute dregs that he'd turned down already. Not to mention, he was on a tight schedule, had been delayed already, and his ships really weren't meant for sailing most of the way around the world through tropical waters, so he wanted to spend as little time as possible sitting around waiting for reinforcements. Rozhestvensky was so firmly against it that he deliberately sent back the wrong directions in the hopes that High Command would simply give up and have the Third Squadron go back home. They didn't.
</li><li> After the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RMSTitanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RMSTitanic">RMS Titanic</a> struck the iceberg on April 14th 1912, the Marconi wireless operators sent out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressCall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressCall">CQD and SOS distress signals</a> explaining that they were slowly sinking. One of the first ships to respond was the German cruise liner <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Frankfurt">SS Frankfurt<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>. It is assumed that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LanguageBarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LanguageBarrier">Language Barrier</a> made it difficult for the <em>Frankfurt's</em> operator to properly translate the <em>Titanic's</em> increasingly frantic calls for help to his captain, and he repeatedly had to ask the <em>Titanic</em> to clarify her situation for the better part of two hours. At some point, the <em>Titanic's</em> operator (quite famously) lost his patience and essentially told him to shut up, stop jamming the airwaves and simply stay out of it:
<div class="indent"> <strong>SS Frankfurt:</strong> FRANKFURT TO TITANIC: WE ARE 100 MILES OFF. WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>RMS Titanic:</strong> FOOL. YOU FOOL. STAND BY. STAND BY. STAND BY AND KEEP OUT. KEEP OUT.
</div></li><li> Well meaning people might try to help a introvert/loner or a shy person open up and be more social. They tend to either not realize that said person is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive">perfectly fine being alone</a> or fail to realize that they are making things worse.

<ul><li> "Hey! It looks like you're reading an article on TV Tropes! Would you like help with that?" If those words set off an involuntary shudder, you almost certainly used Microsoft Office during the deeply unloved era of Clippy, the "helpful" assistant that constantly interrupted your work to tell you it thought you were doing work and would you like it to help with that work that you would have finished already if you weren't desperately seeking the <em><strong>GO AWAY AND NEVER BOTHER ME AGAIN!!!</strong></em> button. (There wasn't one, but it was at least possible to disable Clippy with a bit of effort.)
</li><li> When writing computer programs for multi-core machines, due to unwanted assistance from the CPU, sometimes a variable won't be what you set it to — for example if you set, say, x to 1 and read it back, you might get something else. The cause? The CPU is executing instructions out of order to "grease the wheels"; normally safe on programs that run on a single core, but for ones that run on multiple cores, the effects can cause bugs or cause garbage to be read back, since something wasn't updated when you thought it was supposed to be. Luckily there are ways to force the CPU to synchronise memory access to avoid this problem.
</li><li> In programming languages that aren't strongly typed, you can usually declare a variable without specifying what kind of information it has to hold, and the compiler will just do its best to figure it out from context. Which can lead to some fairly spectacular (and sometimes difficult to diagnose) failures if, for instance, you intend a variable to hold an integer but accidentally refer to it as if it were a boolean — where a 0 will be read as "False" but <em>any other value at all</em> will be interpreted as "True". Weakly-typed languages try to help you, the coder, get the job done quickly, and they work great — right up to the point where they suddenly don't.
</li><li> Many modern art programs have a "vectorizing" feature which smooths and simplifies strokes made by the user. A handy feature for those with shaky hands or seeking to create ultra-clean <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animesque" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animesque">Animesque</a> linework. To experienced artists, it is an anathema called "shoestringing" which turns precisely controlled twitches and pressure changes into bland smears and tapering streaks only vaguely related to the actual stroke.
</li><li> Many word processing programs have automatic features such as spelling correction, whole-word selection, etc, that get in the way in some situations (deliberately misspelling a word for effect, trying to select letters in the middle of a word, unusual proper names, etc). And then came the virtual keyboards...
</li><li> The Microsoft Windows 10 Updates. It won't take no for an answer, it decides on its own if and when it will update, and it takes hacky <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopHoleAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopHoleAbuse">Loop Hole Abuse</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">Good Bad Bugs</a> to <em>almost</em> turn them off. Very annoying if you're the kind of person who leaves your computer running overnight to perform tasks only to later find that your computer spontaneously decided to install updates and reset itself in the night, cancelling and ruining the task you expected it to have completed by morning.
</li><li> Anti-virus software:
<ul><li> While well-intentioned (at least software that isn't straight up scammy malware), it can sometimes delete or quarantine false-positive files that it thinks are viruses. While you can usually undo the action, or shut your anti-virus off temporarily, it's possible it'll just zap the innocent file again.
</li><li> Avast Antivirus is infamous for its "sandbox" mode that is triggered when you open an executable for the first time. This is meant to help catch malicious software by running it for 15 seconds in an isolated environment. However, not only does it take up time, it can even interfere with the functionality of the file or files that depend on it, or even permanently cripple whatever software you were going to run, forcing a reinstall of it.
</li></ul></li><li> Passwords:
<ul><li> Some services impose restrictions on what you can have in a password, like requiring at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number, or either requiring non-alphanumeric "special" characters or banning them. This is supposed to help people come up with more secure passwords, but for many it just ends up forcing them to make a less memorable password that, ultimately, isn't much more secure than the password they initially had in mind (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Xkcd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Xkcd">xkcd</a> is known for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleYetAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleYetAwesome">"string some random words together"</a> method of password creation, which is widely regarded as secure but will often lead to rejected passwords if the above password requirements are in place). Restrictions on passwords also make it easier for malicious individuals to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TryEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TryEverything">Try Everything</a> for a password in hopes of gaining access, since there are less possible passwords to attempt; to be fair, some services and systems lock out the user after too many failed password attempts, but that has has its own problems.
</li><li> Some services, such as PayPal, disallow pasting passwords into the password field, usually when generating a new password. This is supposed to, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/websites-please-stop-blocking-password-managers-2015/">according to a PayPal representative<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, prevent malware-related attacks, but it also ends up punishing users who use password managers to quickly and safely protect their accounts since you now have to type the password you want to change to (as opposed to generating a new password in your password manager and copypasting it with minimal hassle), and while the "type your password a second time" field found on many password change forms is supposed to prevent you mistyping your password, it's possible to have Caps Lock on by mistake (and anything that cares about being secure will make passwords case-sensitive) or even make the same typo twice.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> has a list of suggested search terms if you type in something broad, which is nice except for the fact that the suggested search terms block the top search results and they're hard to get rid of, almost forcing you to use a more specific search term. Worse yet, it sometimes appears randomly when watching a video (especially when making it full screen). So suddenly this list of suggested, more specific search terms that's supposed to help make finding what you want easier is actually intruding on your ability to watch videos that you want to watch by forcing you to use a more specific search term by blocking the video you're trying to watch.
