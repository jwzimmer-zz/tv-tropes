In many cases:
</p><ul><li> It involves a show's two perennial rivals.
</li><li> It happens because the two rivals were only focused on beating each other, which caused them to forgot that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItRivals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItRivals">there were others competing as well</a>.
</li><li> It might actually be the work of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneJudgeToRuleThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneJudgeToRuleThemAll">judge with veto power</a>, and the result leads the rivals to put their rivalry into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">some sort of perspective</a>—or it prompts the designated good guy to be all, "Hey, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWinBecauseYouDidnt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWinBecauseYouDidnt">at least the other guy didn't win</a>."
</li><li> Everybody else but the Dark Horse (or just the two main rivals) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat">stopped to cheat</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatersNeverProsper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatersNeverProsper">making this person the winner by default</a>.
</li><li> What seems to be the Dark Horse's weakness turns out to be an advantage.
</li></ul><p>A common manifestation of this trope involves the protagonist of the story as the judge in a contest, forced to choose between two people, each of whom is extremely important to him (say, a love interest and a best friend or relative). He will often attempt to dodge the difficult decision by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Taking a Third Option</a> and ignoring both choices in favor of someone totally different (who may or may not be actually deserve the honor).

<ul><li> A variation is used in commercials, when a perennial also-ran in the market wants to raise its profile in the mind of the consumer. The commercial presents a story in which the top two brands are fighting it out, but the third brand pulls a surprise win. Rarely does this actually pull the company in question into the top two, but it can get it recognized as the underdog.
<ul><li> 7up did this, with Coke and Pepsi trucks drag racing and being overtaken by the 7up truck.
</li><li> Snapple took this a step further by designing an entire ad campaign celebrating their status as the #3 beverage company in the U.S.—because "unlike #1 and 2, 3 knows not everyone likes the same thing"—never mind that the #1 (Coke) and #2 (Pepsi) companies also make more than one product.
</li><li> DHL did a series in which UPS and FedEx drivers are in a race, but it's futile, because the DHL truck was ahead of them all the time.

They all get beaten out by some random girl named Caren... who turns up again soon after, revealed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">not so random after all</a>.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a> episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> had a go-kart race with many different rivalries, but Nabiki and Kasumi won by driving conservatively while the other racers got into one of their typical fights and finally blew themselves off the road (literally). Another episode had Ranma-chan, Akane, Ukyo, Kodachi, Shampoo and <em>Tsubasa</em> enter a beauty contest organized by Nabiki for various reasons. The winner? <em>Kasumi</em>, who was acting as the assistant and not actually taking part in the contest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RuneSoldierLouie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RuneSoldierLouie">Rune Soldier Louie</a></em> has a filler episode where Louie and his mentor/rival Genie compete to see who can finish a race first. They spend so much time fighting that another rival's horse finishes first (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> A White one, to confuse things</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiUniverse">Tenchi Universe</a></em> has an episode where the girls enter a swimsuit competition, naturally with emphasis on the rivalry between Ayeka and Ryoko. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nagi</span> wins with a last minute entry.
<ul><li> It became a semi-running joke in both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Muyo!</a></em> and <em>Tenchi Universe</em> to have Ayeka and Ryoko (and sometimes the other girls) competing fiercely to tend to a wounded Tenchi, only to be beaten to the punch by Sasami when they weren't looking.
</li><li> Played for laughs in the original OVA <em>Tenchi Muyo</em> series. In one episode, Ayeka and Ryoko are strongly competing to gain Tenchi's affections. It continues throughout the day and during the night when both girls try to sneak into Tenchi's room to make out with him. In the end, Sasami (who also has a crush on Tenchi, but is better at hiding it) is able to gain entry just by knocking on his door and asking to come in. Once Ayeka and Ryoko realize this, they try to rush into the room, only to fall into a trap which teleports them to the lake outside of the house. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">And then Mihoshi shows up.</a>

The three demon factions competing for supremacy are Raizen's (led by Yusuke), Yomi's, and Mukuro's. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yusuke loses, but the fighting has weakened the others to the point where a relatively unknown demon (Enki, a former acquaintance of the deceased demon lord Raizen), uninterested in the factional fighting, wins.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/OokamiSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/OokamiSan">Ōkami-san</a></em> has a beauty contest in which Otohime and Mimi are competing. Mimi places dead last with <em>0</em> votes and Otohime gets only 1 vote, while a character who won't be important until later wins.
<ul><li> Of course, this was all Exactly As Planned by the other members of the Otogi Bank. Otohime's one vote was from Urashima, the guy Otohime and Mimi were fighting over in the first place, to remind her what's really important. The character who <em>actually</em> won was a ringer thrown in by Otogi Bank.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em>, the Miss Macross contest appears to be in the bag for famous actress Jamis Merin, with Roy Focker going as far as suggesting that the whole contest was just a publicity stunt for her (or else she'd have been a judge rather than a contestant). Indeed, the novelization of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Robotech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Robotech">Robotech</a></em> explicitly portrays it as such. However, Minmay ends up winning, likely due to the fact that the audience is full of soldiers who frequent her restaurant.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:

In the end nobody reaches Chunin except <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Shikamaru who gave up during the third trial thinking he had no chance of winning over his adversary, Temari; he'd outmaneuvered her and caught her in his Shadow Jutsu, but was nearly out of chakra and had no clear way to finish her off.</span> Two ninja note that they thought it was a wise decision compared with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Naruto (the main character) and Neji (considered the strongest Genin in the village)</span> fighting until they were almost exhausted.

Instead of Kirby, Tiff and Tuff, or King Dedede winning the race, it was the Mayor who won who caught up being several laps behind.

Both want to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> initiate the apocalypse because they believe humanity cannot survive otherwise.</span> However, due primarily to the head of NERV's cruel treatment of his son, Shinji Ikari, and a startling number of Shinji's friends dying in horrible ways, Shinji himself ends up being the one to initiate Third Impact. And then, essentially, everybody dies. Hey, whoever said that a Darkhorse Victory was always funny or happy?

They all make uniquely dramatic and sappy performances, but they all lose to a random little girl who talked about how much she loved her dad.

Jet is so confident that he takes a nap in the middle of the race; while he's still able to return to the front of the pack when he wakes up, the second-place pack is able to catch up just enough to grab onto him, dragging them all down into a tangled pile right in front of the finish line; they're so distracted that they forget to stand up and cross the finish line until everyone else has already beaten them to it. While Erza managed to sneak out of the pile and across the finish line with the rest of the guild, the remaining four ended up tying for last place.

Betty, Veronica and Moose are all about to pound Archie, but he defuses the situation by showing them his clipboard, proving that he did his best to help them by giving them all an "A" grade. His skin seems saved until the girl who won comes by to thank him for tipping the scale in her favor with a grade of "A+ ". The story ends with Archie running for his life.
</li><li> Another Archie story involves a track meet between several schools. Riverdale finishes second in every single event while two rival schools alternate beating them out for first. In the end, however, Riverdale, thanks to all its second place finishes, wins the meet on total points.
</li><li> Another story is sort of a combination of the above two. Every judge in a beauty contest votes for Ethel for second place because no judge wants to give points to someone who might beat his choice for winner (i.e. his own girlfriend), so she gets the most points overall.

Reuven declines the award because he didn't really earn it, and it ends up going to some other male student, whose name we never hear.

Yvie Oddly still got a lot of attention based on her monstrous style of drag, and extreme flexibility while performing (brought on by Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome).

<ul><li> The Nintendo Wii. Before the 7th Console Generation truly began, it was widely believed that the PS3 and Xbox 360 would sell far better than the Wii, and that the Wii would be dead last in sales. Needless to say that didn't happen. To be fair though, after the poor sales of the Gamecube, expectations were understandably low. But now for once Nintendo is strongly in 1st place while Sony is in last, but catching up to the X360. Of course whether or not this should have happened is often a source of debate. The only downside to this surprise victory is that its one of the biggest reasons why other companies are slow to adapt to the Wii's success. (On the other hand, the success of the Nintendo DS is less surprising, since all the way back to 1989 Nintendo has been a lot more consistently successful in handhelds, but that's a different story.)
<ul><li> Likewise, the Sony PlayStation4 was expected to lose to the Nintendo Wii U and the Xbox One. However, poor advertising on the Wii U's part and issues with Xbox One firmly put the PS4 in the lead and the Wii U in dead last.

He also meets a younger sylvan named Fleur, who isn't as good at the egg hunt as the other three due to dedicating her skills to painting more than hunting.

The main plot of the game is deciding who wins by helping them take bases, screwing up their enemies intelligence, annihilating minor factions who are allied against them, etc. However, instead of helping any of the above, you can assassinate Mr.House and take control of his robot army. You can then use that robot army to defeat both the New California Republic and the Legion at Hoover Dam (after optionally dealing with the various raider groups and Legion bases around the Mojave) and take control of Vegas for yourself. It's not statistically the best ending (it ends with at least two "bad" ending slides and several neutral ones, as opposed to the NCR ending where all "good" endings are possible for everyone).

Neku turns out to be something of a natural, but is totally outclassed by Shooter, who destroys him in the semifinal. However, because Joshua tampered with his pins, Shooter ends up losing the tournament to Sota, another player, who Neku and Joshua hadn't even met yet.

The Internet is rife with tales of international minnows winning the World Cup, or lower-league sides winning cup tournaments.

</li><li> The 1992 Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program. For the first time, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> had a worthy opponent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RenAndStimpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RenAndStimpy">Ren &amp; Stimpy</a></em>. The award went to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AClaymationEaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AClaymationEaster">A Claymation Easter</a></em>, a forgettable CBS special. In DVD commentaries made a decade later, staffers from both shows were still angry about the decision, and basically said "if we didn't win, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">the other show should have</a>!" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averting</a> the "at least <em>they</em> didn't win" variant.
</li><li> The 1993 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress looked like a dead heat between <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoanPlowright" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoanPlowright">Joan Plowright</a> (for <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EnchantedApril" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EnchantedApril">Enchanted April</a></em>) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VanessaRedgrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VanessaRedgrave">Vanessa Redgrave</a> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HowardsEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HowardsEnd">Howards End</a></em>), with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudyDavis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudyDavis">Judy Davis</a> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HusbandsAndWives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HusbandsAndWives">Husbands and Wives</a></em>) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MirandaRichardson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MirandaRichardson">Miranda Richardson</a> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Damage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Damage">Damage</a></em>) also seen as in contention. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarisaTomei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarisaTomei">Marisa Tomei</a>, nominated for the comedy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyCousinVinny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyCousinVinny">My Cousin Vinny</a></em>, was seen as a bit of a surprise nominee. After Tomei won the Oscar, it sparked a rumor that presenter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackPalance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackPalance">Jack Palance</a> had read the wrong name (those rumors were finally put to rest after the Best Picture mix-up between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LaLaLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LaLaLand">La La Land</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Moonlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Moonlight">Moonlight</a></em> at the 2017 Academy Awards).
</li><li> The very next year, the same category was seen as a showdown between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WinonaRyder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WinonaRyder">Winona Ryder</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RosiePerez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RosiePerez">Rosie Perez</a>, respectively nominated for <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAgeOfInnocence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAgeOfInnocence">The Age Of Innocence</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Fearless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Fearless">Fearless</a></em>.

Paquin was so stunned, she could barely speak at the podium.
</li><li> The 2003 Oscar Best Actor race was a tight one, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicolasCage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicolasCage">Nicolas Cage</a> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Adaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Adaptation">Adaptation.</a></em>), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackNicholson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackNicholson">Jack Nicholson</a> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AboutSchmidt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AboutSchmidt">About Schmidt</a></em>), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielDayLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielDayLewis">Daniel Day-Lewis</a> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GangsOfNewYork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GangsOfNewYork">Gangs of New York</a></em>) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCaine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCaine">Michael Caine</a> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheQuietAmerican" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheQuietAmerican">The Quiet American</a></em>) (all past winners) were seen as neck and neck in various precursor wins and support. Instead, the Oscar went to first-time nominee <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdrienBrody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdrienBrody">Adrien Brody</a> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePianist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePianist">The Pianist</a></em>), who was as stunned as anyone, and was reportedly the only nominee who hadn't bothered to prepare a speech.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a> Kids' Choice Awards:
<ul><li> Who can forget the night <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob</a></em> went down? In 2008, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> gave Nick's own cash cow its first and only loss.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note58r5s');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note58r5s" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note58r5s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Granted, ATLA was <em>also</em> a Nick series...</span>
</li><li> <em>SpongeBob</em>'s domination of the KCAs was so huge that <em>nobody</em> expected <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpongeBobMovieSpongeOutOfWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpongeBobMovieSpongeOutOfWater">The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water</a></em> to lose its category in 2015. But then, once the show won its umpteenth prize and no announcement was made about the movie, its loss was all but confirmed. Alas, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BigHero6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BigHero6">Big Hero 6</a></em> won.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> vs. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> vs. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames">The Hunger Games</a></em> battle of 2012 was the most highly anticipated battle in the history of the Favorite Book category. But who expected <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DiaryOfAWimpyKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DiaryOfAWimpyKid">Diary of a Wimpy Kid</a></em> to walk out with the Blimp? And that's not even counting its victories in other years over young-adult heavyweights.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Wipeout2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Wipeout2008">Wipeout (2008)</a></em> constantly won "Favorite Reality TV Show", beating out several much more iconic shows like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol">American Idol</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasGotTalent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasGotTalent">America's Got Talent</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVoice">The Voice</a></em>. Its luck run out in 2015, when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DanceMoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DanceMoms">Dance Moms</a></em> won, and that was its last nomination as it had concluded the year beforehand.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FifthHarmony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FifthHarmony">Fifth Harmony</a> winning the 2016 award for "Favorite Music Group" was a huge moment not only for fans of the band, but because they won over the seemingly unbeatable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneDirection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneDirection">One Direction</a>, who have never lost a Kids' Choice Awards nomination beforehand. Granted the latter were on hiatus at the time, and they likely would have won had they still been active.
</li><li> Most people expected <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InsideOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InsideOut">Inside Out</a></em> to win "Favorite Animated Movie" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SelenaGomez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SelenaGomez">Selena Gomez</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HotelTransylvania2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HotelTransylvania2">Hotel Transylvania 2</a></em> to take home "Favorite Voice from an Animated Movie" in 2016. Instead, the reverse happened (with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmyPoehler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmyPoehler">Amy Poehler</a> taking home the voice acting award).
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangerThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangerThings">Stranger Things</a></em> is a very popular television series, few people expected it to be nominated at a kids' award ceremony, let alone win, due to it being a dark TV-14 rated show. But alas, that's what happened in 2018 for both the show itself and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MillieBobbyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MillieBobbyBrown">Millie Bobby Brown</a>, Even more surprising was the fact that Brown <em>actually showed up</em>, since people assumed an actress who specializes in serious adult fare wouldn't be bothered to attend a kids' show. She gave a speech honoring the survivors of the Parkland school shooting (their March for Our Lives protest took place earlier that day), and while she got a lot of praise for doing so, quite a few people say Nick rigged the award in her favor to let her make the speech, since it was evident it was pre-planned and they have already announced beforehand they would honor the movement.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DemiLovato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DemiLovato">Demi Lovato</a> rather unexpectedly took home the "Favorite Female Singer" award in 2018 against much more popular competition like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SelenaGomez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SelenaGomez">Selena Gomez</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a>.
</li><li> Noah Centineo and Joey King in the movie acting categories of 2019 for their starring roles in two teen-oriented Netflix comedies. In doing so, they beat out several actors who starred in big budget blockbusters like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther">Black Panther</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar">Avengers: Infinity War</a></em>.
</li><li> Given its themes, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Riverdale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Riverdale">Riverdale</a></em> being nominated for, let alone winning, "Favorite TV Drama" in 2019, would probably have counted as an example if not for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangerThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangerThings">Stranger Things</a></em>' winning the year before.
</li></ul></li><li> The 1985 Grammy award for Album Of The Year was expected to be won by either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince">Prince</a>'s <em>Purple Rain</em> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a>'s <em>Born In The USA</em>. The two ended up splitting the rock-oriented voting bloc, allowing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LionelRichie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LionelRichie">Lionel Richie</a>'s <em>Can't Slow Down</em> to take the award. (For the record, the other two nominees for that year were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TinaTurner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TinaTurner">Tina Turner</a>'s <em>Private Dancer</em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CyndiLauper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CyndiLauper">Cyndi Lauper</a>'s <em>She's So Unusual</em>.)
</li><li> The 2011 Grammy for Album of the Year turned into one. Lady Gaga won for Pop Album, Lady Antebellum's "Need you Now" won both Song and Record of the Year, and Eminem won Best Rap Album. Think one of those three would win? NOPE! It went to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArcadeFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArcadeFire">Arcade Fire</a>, a semi-obscure indie ensemble from Canada who never had any hits prior.
</li><li> In 2015's Video Game Awards's "Best Shooter" category: the nominees were <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsIII">Call of Duty: Black Ops III</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsBattlefront2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsBattlefront2015">Star Wars Battlefront</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo5Guardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo5Guardians">Halo 5: Guardians</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Destiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Destiny">Destiny</a>: The Taken King</em>, all of which were very much hyped by their developers, had enormous budgets, were sequels to well-established franchises, had Hollywood-level marketing campaigns, and created by teams with superior experience in shooters. Oh, and also there was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">new IP about cartoonish anthropomorphic squids</a> created by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">a company</a> with little experience making shooters and was released <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">a console</a> with poor sales. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em> took the victory.
</li><li> Mark Rylance's numerous Best Supporting Actor wins for his role as Rudolf Abel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BridgeOfSpies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BridgeOfSpies">Bridge of Spies</a></em> certainly weren't out of nowhere (he had taken BAFTA and several critics prizes and was nominated at every single major precursor ahead of the Oscars), but it was generally considered a shock when he managed to emerge victorious over Sylvester Stallone (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Creed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Creed">Creed</a></em>), Christian Bale (The Big Short), Tom Hardy (The Revenant), and Mark Ruffalo (Spotlight). Sylvester Stallone especially given how Stallone was considered a sentimental favorite.

<ul><li> Most people who were paying attention to the voting running up to the 1991 World Fantasy Award for Short Fiction expected it to go to either Thomas Ligotti's "The Last Feast of Harlequin" or Elizabeth Massie's "Stephen." The winner was the 19th issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman">The Sandman</a></em>, "A Midsummer Night's Dream", by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a> and Charles Vess. The fact that a comic book, and not one of the "serious pieces of literature" walked away with the award was so upsetting to the World Fantasy Convention's board of directors that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">altered the rules</a> so that no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBook">Comic Book</a> would ever be nominated for the short fiction prize again, much less actually have the gall to be good enough to <em>win</em> the thing.
</li><li> Time Magazine's lists can cover this in spades! For example, how many people expected "You" to win the <em>Person of the Year</em> in 2006? Or for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013">Frozen</a></em>'s representation on the 2014 Time 100 to be songwriters Robert and Kristen Lopez over Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, the movie's directors, or Idina Menzel, the public face of the film? Or for TV actresses to be represented on their "Most Influential Teenagers" list by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen">Mad Men</a></em>'s Kiernan Shipka over <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaisieWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaisieWilliams">Maisie Williams</a> despite the latter being much more widely known?
</li><li> When Hasbro asked the fans to pick five nominees for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> Hall of Fame, most fans predicted the five choices would be Soundwave, Shockwave, Grimlock, Jazz, and Rodimus. However, Rodimus didn't make it in... But <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Dinobot</a> did. Then, nobody expected Dinobot to topple the others especially Soundwave but in the end... A character from Beast Wars beat four of the most famous TFs from G1.
</li><li> In 2011, EA Sports and ESPN hosted a tournament to see which NFL player would grace the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaddenNFL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaddenNFL">Madden 2012</a> cover. The best player from each team was chosen for the bracket, and the fans voted each round. Such big names as Aaron Rodgers, Adrian Peterson, Hines Ward, and Drew Brees fell by the wayside. In the finals, the controversial Michael Vick made the finals, but he lost to... Peyton Hillis of the Cleveland Browns. Making him only the second Madden cover boy from a team that didn't make the playoffs the previous year. (The first? Vince Young, who had just won Rookie of the Year the previous year.)

</li><li> Years before, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft">StarCraft</a></em> managed to upset some heavy competition (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">Wind Waker</a></em>) in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/c04spr.html">a game contest<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

Reddit trolls, fishy happenings, and indications that the LoL forums <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">offered prizes if Draven won the contest</a> didn't help the least.
</li><li> Two years after Draven, another case of rallying deciding a contest was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em> winning a Best Game Ever contest. <a class="urllink" href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/poll/6182-did-the-best-game-ever-contest-convince-you-to-try-undertale">There was some backlash<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and trolling, but thankfully less than with Draven.
</li><li> The Contest board also coined two explanations that fit many upsets: <a class="urllink" href="http://board8.wikia.com/wiki/Sore_Thumb_Factor">Sore Thumb Factor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (people vote for the weird one that stands out) and <a class="urllink" href="http://board8.wikia.com/wiki/LFF">Leech Fanbase Factor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (if two\three entries share support, split vote will help a third wheel go through).
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> character ballot. Of all the characters that Nintendo could get the rights to, few expected that the titular protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta">Bayonetta</a></em> would be the one to get the most votes — or that Nintendo would happily bring the infamously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatureRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatureRating">M rated</a> maelstrom of innuendo, violence, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Camp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Camp">camp</a> into the very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneTenAndUpRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneTenAndUpRating">E10+ rated</a> <em>Super Smash Bros</em>. (There were, of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">necessary adjustments</a>.)
<ul><li> Interestingly, the ballot turned out to be more of a suggestion box than anything else by <em>Ultimate</em>'s release, as characters with moderate-to-high levels of support, like King K. Rool, Banjo &amp; Kazooie and veterans like Snake, that were specifically supported in the context of it got considered and included. Bayonetta's initial victor status for the DLC roster of <em>4</em> mostly came out of practical and timing reasons (although the high level of support in Europe helped).

Both those songs were international hits, breaking the Top 10 of nearly every country, and it looked like Triple J would follow that consensus. Final result: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanceJoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanceJoy">Vance Joy</a>, an unlabeled artist who didn't even have a full album yet, with "Riptide".
</li><li> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> broke up, it was expected that either of the band's main songwriters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a>, would score the first solo number one album. No one would have suspected the honor would go to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison">George Harrison</a> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6tidg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6tidg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6tidg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">who was typically only allowed to contribute one or two songs (or four on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWhiteAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWhiteAlbum">The White Album</a></em>) on each Beatle album and was clearly treated as a junior within the group</span> and his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AllThingsMustPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AllThingsMustPass">All Things Must Pass</a></em> triple-disc album, nor that it would outsell anything released by his ex-bandmates. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">To hang a lampshade on this</a>, George would name his 1974 solo album (and the boutique record label he started in 1976) <em>Dark Horse</em>.

Probably the last answer they'd come up with would be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lorde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lorde">16-year-old from New Zealand</a>.

</li><li> A decent handful from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest">Eurovision Song Contest</a>:
<ul><li> One of the first major examples was Spain's Massiel beating out the United Kingdom's Cliff Richard in 1968. His song, "Congratulations," was co-written by the same songwriting duo who had written Sandie Shaw's victorious "Puppet on a String" the year before, had already become a smash hit on the British charts, and he himself was considered the biggest pop star in Britain at the time.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7i95h');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7i95h" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7i95h');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">To put it into perspective: in the grand scheme of Eurovision contestants' chart success, Richard comes second only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA">ABBA</a> and right ahead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CelineDion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CelineDion">Céline Dion</a>. And that's virtually all in the UK!</span> Newspaper headlines even asked, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeweyDefeatsTruman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeweyDefeatsTruman">"Who will come second to 'Congratulations'?"</a>. The song has since become a contest evergreen, but Spain and the UK leveled the score the following year when both countries made up half of a four-way tie for first place (the other two being the Netherlands and France).
</li><li> Sweden's Herreys brothers and "Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley" in 1984. The big favorites that year were Germany, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, but lackluster live performances led to Luxembourg finishing tenth and Germany and the Netherlands missing the top ten entirely.
</li><li> Theretofore-perennial underdogs Norway in 1985. While they were never out of contention, Germany's Wind were expected to sweep the board with their anthemic "Für alle." Instead, Germany's early lead got scuppered by a few nonplussed countries (including, surprisingly enough, Austria and Switzerland), while Norway scored consistently well through the whole voting sequence.
</li><li> 1994 saw host country Ireland as a distant third-favorite on their second year in a row of hosting, with the United Kingdom's Frances Ruffelle and Germany's MeKaDo the big favorites with their more Eurovision-friendly pop songs. The song was performed by a male duo (a grouping that had never sealed a victory before) and was drawn relatively early on in the show, which seemed to indicate a bad outcome. Instead, the quiet and introspective "Rock and Roll Kids" walked away with the biggest victory ever seen at the contest up to that point, with 226 points in the bag <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">(sixty points clear of runner-up Poland)</a>, giving Ireland and Eurovision's first and only hat trick of victories.
</li><li> 2000-2003 was pretty much the era of Dark Horse Victories. The first two were unconventional male duos (Denmark's Olsen Brothers were two veteran musicians in their mid-50s, and the following year saw a duet between 50-year-old Aruban Dave Benton and 21-year-old Estonian Tanel Padar) and the other two were lightweight pop songs with flashy stage performances (Latvia's Marie N with her gender-bending costume-changing extravaganza and Turkey' Sertab Erener and her squadron of bellydancers). The first two utterly crushed the competition and the latter two were neck-and-neck with their more favored rivals (Malta in 2002 and Russia and Belgium in 2003) until the bitter end.
</li><li> Two narrowly-averted examples in 2018 and 2019 by virtue of the jury vote. 2018 saw the two contenders, Israel's Netta and Cyprus' Eleni Foureira, both lose to Austria's Cesar Sampson and his soulful "Nobody but You" in the jury vote (Israel took third, Cyprus fifth). They also both finished behind perennial favorite Sweden's Benjamin Ingrosso and "Dance You Off," a low-key number with music video-like staging. The situation changed dramatically when the televote scores were announced: Austria came thirteenth and Sweden only came <em>twenty-third</em>, paving the way for Israel to win and Cyprus to finish as runner-up.
<ul><li> Then, in 2019, heavy favorite Duncan Laurence from the Netherlands and strong contender Mahmood from Italy took a backseat in the jury vote to Sweden's John Lundvik (not out of the question, given his song's more positive reception compared to "Dance You Off" and the juries' general affinity for Swedish entries)...and North Macedonia's Tamara Todevska, whose country hadn't qualified for seven years and wound up <em>winning the jury vote</em>, with the Netherlands in third and Italy fourth. On the televote side, the Netherlands' second place allowed them to win and Italy's third brought them up to second. The surprise was Norway's Keiino, a fan-favorite that had tanked in the jury vote, won the televote handily. It was only the second time that neither the jury nor televote winner won the overall contest (that being Ukraine in 2016, whom both parties placed second), but the margin by which their respective winners differed was much larger.

<ul><li> The 1998 Minnesota gubernatorial election was seen as a race between St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman and Attorney General Hubert "Skip" Humphrey III, the son of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LyndonJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LyndonJohnson">Lyndon Johnson</a>'s Veep and former US Senator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HubertHumphrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HubertHumphrey">Hubert Humphrey</a>.

Under the previous voting system Van Buren would have easily won the nomination early, but a newly introduced requirement for a two-thirds majority killed both his and Cass' chances, as Van Buren had too many detractors from his first (and ultimately only) term as President, while Cass had enough enemies in the party that they voted for Van Buren out of spite to keep Cass below the victory threshold. Eventually Polk was introduced as a new candidate, Van Buren withdrew and threw his support behind him, and Polk defeated Cass on the next ballot. (Polk's nomination was the first time anybody is known to have said "dark horse" in a U.S. political context.)
</li><li> Something very similar happened with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinPierce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinPierce">Franklin Pierce</a> in 1852. This time there there were four candidates (Cass, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesBuchanan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesBuchanan">James Buchanan</a>, Stephen A. Douglas and William L. Marcy) with radically different positions, and the vote kept swinging between the four with none of them willing to back out. Eventually Pierce was introduced to the process, and gradually earned enough support to win the nomination. For perspective, the 1844 race that saw Polk get nominated took ten ballots; this race took <em>forty-nine</em> ballots.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>'s strategy to get the Republican nomination in 1860 — the two favorites (William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase) had each made too many enemies, as did the third-favorite candidate, Edward Bates. Among those who were determined to stop Seward, Lincoln was the alternative candidate that they could agree on.
<ul><li> Lincoln was on the opposite side in the 1854 Illinois Senate race. Republicans and Democrats against the Kansas-Nebraska Act had a slight majority, but a few such Democrats voted for Norman Judd instead of Lincoln on the grounds that they wouldn't be re-elected if they supported a Republican. To prevent the pro-Nebraska Act Democrat candidate from winning, Lincoln withdrew in favor of Judd, who was at least an anti-Nebraska Democrat.
</li></ul></li><li> At the 1868 Democratic National Convention, George H. Pendleton was the initial frontrunner, with numerous other candidates such as incumbent president Andrew Johnson, Winfield Scott Hancock, Sanford Church, Asa Packer, Joel Parker, James E. English, James Rood Doolittle, and Thomas A. Hendricks vying for the position as well. However, the nominee would ultimately be none of them, but former New York governor and convention chair Horatio Seymour, who did not want the nomination but was unanimously selected after the delegates couldn't agree on anyone else. Seymour went on to lose to Republican <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UlyssesSGrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UlyssesSGrant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>.
</li><li> In the 1876 election, James G. Blaine was the initial favorite for the Republican nomination, but came short of the majority needed to win. As his support dwindled throughout the ballots, Republicans feared that he'd lose the election if nominated, so they tried to find an alternative. After his closest opponents Oliver P. Morton, Roscoe Conkling, and Benjamin Bristow dropped out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RutherfordBHayes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RutherfordBHayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a>, who came in fifth place on the first ballot, became the primary opposition and narrowly won the nomination over Blaine.
</li><li> And in 1880, the Republican Convention deadlocked between James Blaine and Ulysses S. Grant, with John Sherman also having support, leading to Blaine's nominator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesGarfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesGarfield">James Garfield</a> being nominated, then elected President.
</li><li> Two-time Democratic candidate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamJenningsBryan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamJenningsBryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> decided to sit out the 1904 presidential election, knowing he had no chance of defeating the enormously popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, and so tried nominating little-known senator Francis Cockrell in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler">Springtime for Hitler</a> gambit, so he would prove a complete disaster and allow Bryan to swoop in and rescue the party in 1908. On the other hand, newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst bid for the Democratic candidacy himself, and his radical views made him popular among voters but feared by the party bosses. In the end Cockrell and Hearst lost the nod to Alton B. Parker, chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals, who was well-liked by the few who knew of him and became the only viable candidate simply because he wasn't too controversial. Roosevelt easily bested Parker in the general election.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarrenHarding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarrenHarding">Warren Harding</a> was a rare <em>deliberate</em> example of this trope. Going into the 1920 Republican convention, he knew full well that he didn't have enough support to win the party's nomination outright, but neither did any of the other candidates. Rather than going in at the start and potentially falling by the wayside early on, he started by campaigning passively, then when it became clear none of the other candidates could win, as initial frontrunners Leonard Wood and Frank Orren Lowden saw their support diminish, Harding presented himself as a compromise candidate and secured the nomination and went on to win the election in a landslide. However, this came back to bite him on the butt; the other delegates, angry at this tactic, successfully conspired to put up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CalvinCoolidge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CalvinCoolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a> instead of Harding's preferred running mate, Irvine Lenroot, which proved all the more important when Harding died halfway through his term, and Coolidge succeeded him.
</li><li> The Democratic Party also had a tumultuous 1920 convention. The initial frontrunners where William Gibbs McAdoo and A. Mitchell Palmer. However, as the ballots continued due to no candidate reaching a majority, James M. Cox saw his support build and became the nominee.
</li><li> The Democratic nomination in 1924 was even more hotly contested. Initially, McAdoo was the frontrunner again. However, controversies arising from his business relationship with Edward Doheny, who had been implicated in the Teapot Dome scandal, and his support from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KuKluxKlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KuKluxKlan">Ku Klux Klan</a> dealt severe blows to his chances. With this, Al Smith's chances of winning the nomination began to grow. However, at the convention, neither candidate was able to win a majority, which ultimately resulted in John W. Davis being nominated as a compromise candidate on the <em>103rd</em> ballot. Davis was then crushed in the general election by incumbent President Calvin Coolidge.
</li><li> Robert A. Taft, Arthur H. Vandenberg, and Thomas E. Dewey were seen as the frontrunners for the 1940 Republican nomination. However, industrialist Wendell Willkie, a former Democrat who had never run for political office before, became a unexpected contender. His support for the Allies in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> earned him the support of Republicans opposed to the other three candidates' isolationism, and he was nominated on the sixth ballot, though he lost to incumbent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> in the general election.
</li><li> In 1952, incumbent President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarryTruman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarryTruman">Harry Truman</a> had initially attempted to gain the Democratic nomination again, but dropped out due to low approval ratings and poor showings in early primaries. Estes Kefauver then became the frontrunner, but the party bosses refused to support him because they viewed him as a maverick who couldn't be trusted. The Democrats attempted to find another candidate, but all had weaknesses. Richard Russell Jr. had support in the South but his support of segregation made him unacceptable to the Northern Democrats. W. Averell Harriman was Truman's preferred choice, but was seen as too inexperienced. Vice President Alben W. Barkley was rejected for being too old. Ultimately the Democrats nominated Adlai Stevenson, who had few political weaknesses but didn't seem to want the nomination much. Stevenson proceeded to lose in a landslide to Republican <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>.
</li><li> The 1972 Democratic nomination initially saw 1968 vice-presidential nominee Edmund Muskie as the frontrunner, with former vice president/1968 presidential nominee Hubert Humphrey also picking up momentum, and George Wallace doing well in the Southern (and even Michigan) primaries after his third-party run as a segregationist candidate in 1968. However, the anti-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">Vietnam War</a> candidate George McGovern built up a grassroots campaign and managed to secure the nomination. President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a> proceeded to bury McGovern in the general election.
<ul><li> This result was less "good fortune" for Nixon than "exactly what we were planning": Muskie's downfall especially was orchestrated by the Republican Committee to Re-Elect the President. The tactics they used to influence the Democratic primaries fall somewhere between distasteful and illegal; some CRP members used the charming sobriquet "ratfucking" to describe their role in the primaries.
</li></ul></li><li> The 1976 Democratic primaries included many well-known contenders, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JerryBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JerryBrown">Jerry Brown</a>, Mo Udall, Henry M. Jackson, and George Wallace the favorites to win the nomination. The eventual winner was <a class="urllink" href="https://prospect.org/article/its-wide-open-race">little-known<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> former Georgia governor (and later president) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JimmyCarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JimmyCarter">Jimmy Carter</a>, who was such a dark horse going into the primaries that when he told his mother he was running for President, she asked him, "President of what?"
</li><li> An almost perfect example of this happened in the 2004 Iowa Democratic caucus: the analysts were certain that the race for the state was between Dick Gephardt (who won the caucuses in 1988) and Howard Dean (who had been leading in the polls in Iowa for months), and the pair got engaged in a vicious negative campaign for much of December. Come January and the caucuses, and <em>two</em> dark horses swept in: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnKerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnKerry">John Kerry</a> won, and John Edwards came in second. Dean and Gephardt were turned into also-rans, and quickly eliminated from the field thereafter. Kerry and Edwards went on to be nominated for president and VP respectively.
</li><li> John McCain's early victory in the 2008 Republican primaries was unexpected leading up to the first contests, with the frontrunners being Mike Huckabee, Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani. During the summer of 2007, McCain's campaign fundraising was poor and he was forced to downsize his staff dramatically, leading many news outlets to predict he would drop out of the race before the primaries even began. He gained in the polls until the end of the year, however, and became the frontrunner after winning the New Hampshire and Florida primaries.
</li><li> In 2009, the Democratic primary for governor of Virginia had Terry McAuliffe, former DNC chairman and Clinton supporter, and Brian Moran, a Virginia politician. This was a classic matchup between the more liberal northern Virginians and the more conservative southern Virginians ... and then the party was crashed when Creigh Deeds, a candidate who drove himself to rallies and fundraisers, won the nomination <em>in a walk</em>. Deeds, however, lost the general election to GOP candidate Bob McDonnell.
</li><li> The lead up to the 2016 Republican primaries looked like it was going to be a <a class="urllink" href="http://theweek.com/articles/451640/over-jeb-bush-gop-nominee-2016">Jeb Bush coronation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: he had raised by far the most money, had name recognition and his family's political machine behind him (his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeHWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeHWBush">father</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">brother</a> were most famous as the last two GOP presidents), and led in most polls. If there was going to be an upset, most pundits predicted it would come from newer party faces like Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz, while many viewed the candidacy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>, a television host who had never held prior office, as a publicity stunt. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivideAndConquer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivideAndConquer">Early on, the establishment vote was split so many ways among so many candidates, most of whom agreed on the major issues</a>; Trump was able to dominate the field with a minority of the vote mainly by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooQuirkyToLose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooQuirkyToLose">espousing ideas that most party members disagreed with in substance, style, or both, but could rally a plurality of the party larger than any other single candidate's base.</a> It also helped that Trump also got a deafening amount of media coverage,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8gzx0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8gzx0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8gzx0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Estimates have ranged from $2–5 billion worth of "earned media."</span> more than all his competition combined.

Later it become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">a more traditional version of this trope with Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz</a>, who became Trump's main opponents.

<ul><li> The 2010 British election debates were like this. Basically, there's Labour (then led by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GordonBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GordonBrown">Gordon Brown</a>) and the Conservatives (led by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DavidCameron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DavidCameron">David Cameron</a>) both hovering between 30% and 60% of the seats at any one time in the past hundred years, and the Liberal Democrats (led by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NickClegg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NickClegg">Nick Clegg</a>) holding all but around 30 of the remaining seats.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10jwb1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10jwb1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10jwb1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Before the election, the House of Commons had 350 Labour members, 197 Conservative, 62 Liberal Democrats, 27 from regional parties, six independents, three vacancies, and the non-voting, unaffiliated, Speaker.</span> Due to Brown's longstanding unpopularity and growing suspicion of Cameron, it was obvious Clegg had to be invited to participate on as it was likely his party could hold the balance of power in the next parliament. What wasn't expected was him to curb-stomp the other two figuratively in the first debate and hold his ground against Cameron in the second debate, mostly because he's a damn good orator (being an atheist Europhile with an aversion to nukes should've destroyed him, especially his Europhilia, but he made it work by noting the eurosceptic parties in the European Parliament <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewbaccaDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewbaccaDefense">failed to support anti-paedophile legislation and efforts</a>). And between the first and second debate, the Lib Dems jumped from clear third to <em>joint first</em> in the polls as well.
<ul><li> Hell, the Lib Dems essentially won the 2010 election despite a <em>net loss</em> of five seats from the 2005 election. Meanwhile the Conservatives won the most seats but failed to get a majority, resulting in a hung parliament meaning that both Labour and the Tories tried to court the Lib Dems into forming a coalition government to gain an overall majority, since they essentially had the balance of power on their side. The Tories successfully agreed a deal with them and Nick Clegg was installed as the Deputy Prime Minister, although as entering into a coalition, especially as a junior partner, involves plenty of compromising and changing policy to accommodate the other party, LD support dropped significantly and resulted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demonization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demonization">demonization</a> as the other parties went to squeeze disaffected LD voters to their side, having to rely on years to rebuild and banking on a good economy to recover position (reversing on tuition fees cost them huge support, but keep in mind that reversing on civil liberties to accommodate Labour would also have cost them huge support).
</li><li> In terms of defeats in certain seats, Lembit Öpik (Lib Dem) and Peter Robinson (<em>leader</em> of the DUP, a Northern Irish unionist party) losing their respective seats with massive swings count too. Had Robinson (not just leader, but first minister of Northern Ireland) had a smaller majority, it would probably have been expected, since he'd recently been involved in a fairly major scandal and Belfast East was traditionally the Alliance Party's strongest constituency (the previous closest time they'd come to winning a seat at Westminster was there in '79, where Robinson won by fewer than a thousand votes, though he'd built up a large lead since then).
</li></ul></li><li> This is almost TRADITIONAL in Conservative Party leadership elections:
<ul><li> 1957: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AnthonyEden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AnthonyEden">Anthony Eden</a> was forced to stand down as Prime Minister after the Suez fiasco. At this stage the party lacked a formal leadership election process,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11ofq9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11ofq9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11ofq9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Mostly it was because they saw themselves as the natural and rightful party of government, and so considered it the reigning monarch's duty to choose a Conservative leader and thus prime minister; the only times they had had to choose a leader in opposition were after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BenjaminDisraeli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BenjaminDisraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a>'s death in 1881, after which they stumbled along without an official leader for a couple of years before the party leaders just named Lord Salisbury, and then when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArthurBalfour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArthurBalfour">Arthur Balfour</a> stepped down in 1911, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BonarLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BonarLaw">Bonar Law</a> succeeded him largely without opposition.</span> and it was widely expected that Rab Butler, who had effectively taken over many of Eden's duties during the final two months of his leadership, would succeed him. After the party executive consulted with senior ministers and Conservative associations up and down the country, however, they found they saw Butler simultaneously as having been both too aggressive (for initially pushing for Eden to overthrow the Egyptian government outright and install a puppet regime) and too weak (for not telling President Eisenhower where to go when he demanded that the UK stop what they were doing) on the matter of Suez. As a result, Eden's chancellor, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HaroldMacmillan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HaroldMacmillan">Harold Macmillan</a>, got the top job instead.
</li><li> 1963: Macmillan stood down due to a combination of health problems and a growing backlash to the Profumo scandal. Rab Butler was again the initial favourite, but it quickly became apparent that his popularity had not risen appreciably from six years prior. The new favourite was Quintin Hogg, who campaigned for the leadership at that year's party conference, then resigned from the House of Lords (he had been the Viscount Hailsham) and won a safe seat in a by-election ... and in doing so, inadvertently ended up ensuring that he <em>didn't</em> become the new leader, as actively campaigning for the leadership was considered beneath a potential prime minister at that time. As a result, the leadership ended up going to another peer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlecDouglasHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlecDouglasHome">Alec Douglas-Home</a>, who also resigned from the House of Lords (formerly Earl of Home) to join the Commons, but waited until after he'd actually been made leader.
</li><li> 1965: Douglas-Home, who had never been particularly comfortable as party leader, stepped down after an election defeat, but not before overseeing the implementation of rules for proper leadership contests. Reginald Maudling was widely expected to win, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EdwardHeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EdwardHeath">Edward Heath</a> as a dark horse and Enoch Powell as a complete outsider. However, Maudling's poor record as chancellor, plus a perception that the Conservatives ought to choose a leader from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HaroldWilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HaroldWilson">Harold Wilson</a>'s generation, left Heath with a majority (though he failed to win due to the rather complicated rules) and both Maudling and Powell withdrew.
</li><li> 1975: Heath was now flagging badly after losing both 1974 elections. However, Maudling had retired, and Powell had hurt his chances by defecting to the Ulster Unionist Party and telling people to vote Labour, leaving Keith Joseph as consensus candidate for the right and frontrunner, only to have to withdraw after giving a speech wherein he espoused support of eugenics, while the main heavyweight on the left, Willie Whitelaw, pledged loyalty to Heath. A woman on the right, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>, decided she may as well be the one to challenge Heath. Nobody expected her to win, but they did expect her to get enough votes to stop Heath winning, forcing him to withdraw in favour of Whitelaw (candidates were at this point allowed to enter and withdraw whenever they please, though if they withdrew they couldn't re-enter, until somebody won a majority with at least a 15% lead). She ended up winning a plurality, which was enough to give her a second-ballot victory jointly with several other candidates from the left standing as well as Whitelaw.
</li><li> 1990: For the first time since her first mandate as prime minister, Thatcher was seriously flagging, now over the poll tax (or, to use her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">Insistent Terminology</a>, Community Charge) and a damaging resignation/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a> from Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Howe, though she easily beat off a challenge from Anthony Meyer the year before, and was challenged by Michael Heseltine. Almost everyone expected the Prime Minister to win again and live to fight another day, but she didn't quite get the necessary lead of 15 percentage points in a vote of her parliamentary party to thwart a leadership challenge. She initially announced she would fight on, only to be persuaded by the Cabinet that they still supported her but didn't think she could win, and she stood aside for Chancellor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnMajor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnMajor">John Major</a> to take the lead over Heseltine and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, who then both withdrew.
</li><li> 1995: Rather odd this one. Major was now flagging, and when he resigned to force out his main challenger, Michael Portillo, everyone expected Portillo to win. But Portillo didn't stand, having realised it was better to be in a strong position to be leader rather than actually leader, while Heseltine agreed to become Major's deputy instead, and Major comfortably beat John "vote for Redwood not the deadwood" Redwood.
</li><li> 1997: Major stood down after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TonyBlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TonyBlair">landslide defeat in the General Election</a>. Michael Portillo would still have been the frontrunner to succeed him — except that at the election he surprisingly lost his seat,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12cks6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12cks6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12cks6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Many people attribute Portillo's loss of a seat where "a hat-stand wearing a blue rosette would get elected" to his exposure in the magazine <em>Scallywag</em> for (1) being a closet homosexual and allegedly having a gay affair with fellow cabinet minister Peter Lilley, plus (2) being a member of a secret ultra-right-wing cabal within the Conservative Party known as the "Pimlico Set" plotting to overthrow John Major and make Portillo the Tory leader and PM. While Portillo was being interviewed on the TV news programme <em>Weekend World</em>, a member of the studio audience stood up and loudly "outed" him on these points. The offender was removed from the studio "with prejudice", but enough people saw and more importantly heard the entire incident to swing the vote in Portillo's Enfield Southgate constituency in favour of political newcomer Stephen Twigg.</span> leaving Michael Howard the frontrunner from the right of the party, with the support of young up-and-comer William Hague in exchange for becoming his deputy. But Hague went back on his word, which, combined with damaging criticism of Howard from Ann Widdecombe, left him dead last on the first ballot and made him withdraw. Ken Clarke then became the favourite, but destroyed his chances by getting rival John Redwood to drop out and endorse him in exchange for becoming deputy leader, which given that Clarke and Redwood were polar opposites politically, was seen as a cynical bit of politicking, and enabled Hague to overtake and defeat Clarke on the final ballot.
</li><li> 2001: Hague resigned after a very bad electoral performance, making him the first Tory leader not to become PM since Austen Chamberlain in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">the First World War</a>, leaving a leadership election under new rules. Ann Widdecombe was an early favourite, but decided against entering after finding out that, while she was immensely popular among the party base, she didn't have much support among the other MPs. Michael Portillo, back in Parliament since a 1999 by-election, was again the frontrunner, closely followed by Ken Clarke — only to be eliminated on the third ballot, leaving Clarke favourite to beat Iain Duncan Smith in the runoff in the party membership ... only for the unheralded Duncan Smith to thrash him 60.7%–39.3%. This was largely attributed to Margaret Thatcher endorsing Duncan Smith prior to the leadership election, and fourth- and fifth-placed candidates David Davis and Michael Ancram throwing their support behind him to prevent Clarke or Portillo from winning.
</li><li> 2005: Having finally succeeded to the leadership unopposed in 2003 due to Duncan Smith's unpopularity among MPs, and despite a much-improved performance in that year's general election (knocking Labour's majority down to 66 seats from 167 in 2001), Michael Howard resigned largely because he would likely be 68 or 69 years old by the time the next election rolled around (indeed, he was 68 years old at the time of the 2010 election). With the Constitutional Treaty firmly off the agenda, perennially popular veteran Ken Clarke was again the frontrunner — only to go out in the first round, leaving David Davis the favourite. But then, after he gave a poorly received speech at conference, the previously unheralded young up-and-comer David Cameron gained momentum and went on to thump Davis 67.6%–32.4% in the members' vote.
</li><li> 2016: After Cameron was forced to resign as prime minister following the country's narrow vote to leave <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEuropeanUnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEuropeanUnion">The European Union</a>, it was treated as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">Foregone Conclusion</a> by the press and much of the public that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BorisJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BorisJohnson">Boris Johnson</a> would replace him. However, an ill-timed newspaper column where Johnson, the de facto leader of the "Leave" campaign, admitted still being unsure as to whether it was the best thing for the country, combined with fellow Leave campaigner Michael Gove (who had initially promised not to run for leader in exchange for becoming Johnson's chancellor) launching a brutal attack on him in the press and announcing his own candidacy, destroyed his support among the party and forced him to withdraw from the race. Gove himself was subsequently knocked out in the MP vote (along with Stephen Crabb and Liam Fox, both of whom were mostly seen as no-hopers), leaving Andrea Leadsom to face off against Home Secretary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheresaMay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheresaMay">Theresa May</a>, the new favourite, for the membership vote. Many predicted that Leadsom might be able to pull this trope off, given her right-wing leanings and an apparent desire among the party membership to re-embrace Thatcherism. However, she wrecked her chances by seeming to accuse May of being unfit to be prime minister because she had never been a mother, resulting in a firestorm in the press that eventually caused Leadsom to drop out, leaving May as winner by default.
</li><li> 2019: Finally averted. May was forced to resign as PM due to her failure to get her Brexit deal through Parliament. Boris Johnson, long considered a frontrunner to replace May, easily won the leadership election, leading on every MPs' ballot and beating Jeremy Hunt (who had succeeded him as Foreign secretary in a cabinet shuffle the year before, funnily enough) in the membership vote by a nearly two-to-one margin. Given the history of Conservative leadership contests, though, some might have considered him an underdog in a roundabout kind of way.
</li></ul></li><li> It's happened a couple of times in Labour Party leadership elections too:
<ul><li> 1980: After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesCallaghan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesCallaghan">James Callaghan</a> was replaced in No. 10 by Margaret Thatcher and Labour in overall government by the Conservative Party in 1979, he stayed on for a while as Labour leader, hoping that it would ensure a smooth transition to his preferred successor, the former chancellor of the Exchequer and Defence secretary Denis Healey. He couldn't have been more wrong. Tony Benn, former member of the cabinet and the standard-bearer of the party's left wing, oversaw the passage of some key internal reforms at the 1980 party conference. However, Benn, who many had thought would be the left's candidate for the leadership, declined to stand. Instead it was Michael Foot, another former cabinet minister (and deputy leader of Labour), who defeated (albeit narrowly) Healey and became the new leader of the Labour Party. Labour subsequently suffered from more infighting—and drifted further to the left—and the "Gang of Four" MPs on the Labour right formed the Social Democratic Party, which formed an electoral alliance with the Liberal Party (and merged with them as today's Liberal Democrats in 1988).
</li><li> 2010: Labour lost power after failing to form a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. David Miliband was widely predicted to replace Gordon Brown, especially considering that many of the other major contenders, such as Alan Johnson and Harriet Harman, chose not to run (Harman was deputy leader and served her first of two stints as acting leader during this leadership election). As it turned out, after seeing off three other competitors, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingRivalry">his younger brother Ed</a> pipped him to the leadership. It should be noted that during Ed Miliband's leadership, Labour changed its rules for leadership contests from an electoral college to a pure one-member-one-vote setup, which would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlySignificantRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlySignificantRule">have a seismic repercussion</a> at the next leadership election...
</li><li> 2015: Ed Miliband resigned after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UnitedKingdomGeneralElection2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UnitedKingdomGeneralElection2015">an election</a> that Labour was expected to win (if not necessarily with a majority) instead resulted in the party's most humiliating defeat since its infamously awful performance in 1983.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13klgi');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13klgi" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13klgi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In 1987, it had won a slightly larger share of the vote but three fewer seats than in 2015.</span> After early favourites Dan Jarvis and Chuka Umunna declined to run, the two frontrunners were seen as Andy Burnham and Yvette Cooper, both veterans of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown's governments, with Liz Kendall also in the running but not really considered a serious contender. However, outsider candidate Jeremy Corbyn annihilated all three of them, winning on the first ballot with nearly three-fifths of the vote and just over triple the share of runner-up Burnham. While many tried to attribute this to Conservative supporters signing up as Labour members on a £3 "supporter's membership" in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler">Springtime for Hitler</a> gambit,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14j5b7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note14j5b7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14j5b7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Multiple pro-Conservative newspapers encouraged their readers to do this in the hope that Corbyn — an even more left-wing politician than Michael Foot — would steer Labour to such a colossal election defeat that it would either end any serious competition to the Conservatives or allow the UK Independence Party to replace Labour as the main party of opposition and ensure total right-wing domination over British politics.</span> analysis of the votes showed that not only did this make no real difference to the outcome, Corbyn would have won by a huge margin in every conceivable scenario short of an MPs-only vote.
</li><li> 2016: While the actual winner (the incumbent Jeremy Corbyn) wasn't a great surprise, the person who ended up being his challenger was the relatively unknown Owen Smith. The better-known, more experienced Angela Eagle had stepped aside so that he could have a one-on-one contest with Corbyn.
</li><li> 2020: After Corbyn's leadership, despite a relatively decent result in the 2017 general election, ended with the party winning its fewest seats since 1935 at the 2019 general election, some people saw it as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">Foregone Conclusion</a> that Rebecca Long-Bailey, long considered Corbyn's heir apparent, would be elected thanks to the same members who had delivered Corbyn his two landslide wins. However, Long-Bailey was badly undermined by a lacklustre campaign, along with the magnitude of the previous year's election defeat leaving members questioning whether the party was on the right track, and the pro-Corbyn group Momentum (whose votes she was relying on) unwittingly alienating much of its membership by holding a ballot on which of the leadership candidates to endorse ... on which the only options were either Long-Bailey or "none of the above" (for perspective, there were four other candidates still in the race at that point). The end result was a crushing 56.2%–27.6% victory for the soft-left candidate Keir Starmer (the remaining 16.2% was won by Lisa Nandy, who initially had some support before Stamer attracted the moderate vote), with Long-Bailey actually doing even worse than Owen Smith had against Corbyn.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15id1d');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15id1d" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15id1d');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(To have seen Long-Bailey as the frontrunner might have been a mistake, though, because Starmer had the most support from the MPs and Labour-affiliated extra-parliamentary groups and individuals — thought it should be noted that Andy Burnham and Owen Smith had the most support from these groups in 2015 and 2016 respectively, and both lost badly to Corbyn)</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The Liberal Democrats have had this happen a couple of times as well:
<ul><li> 2007: After Sir Menzies Campbell stepped down following a short, undistinguished spell as leader (he and a lot of other people saw him as a caretaker after Charles Kennedy was retired), the initial favourites to succeed him were Vince Cable, interim leader and party veteran, and Chris Huhne, an experienced MP and former member of the European Parliament who had narrowly lost out to Campbell in the previous year's membership election. Cable refused to contest the leadership, however, and Huhne ended up being one of only two nominees alongside Nick Clegg, a former MEP and relative political newcomer. While he initially remained the favourite, Huhne's campaign was damaged early on when it released a document derisively nicknaming his opponent "Calamity Clegg" and attacking his political track record, something that (at the time, at least) was seen as below the belt for a leadership contest. Huhne's campaign never recovered from this, and he ended up losing to Clegg by just 500 votes.
</li><li> 2015: With the party having been almost totally annihilated at that year's general election (falling from 57 MPs in 2010 to eight this year), Nick Clegg was forced to stand down as leader. Without many candidates to choose from, the contest came down to Norman Lamb, one of the most experienced of the few surviving Liberal Democrat MPs, and the relatively obscure Tim Farron. In the end, Lamb was hurt by having been relatively high-up in the previous coalition government, while Farron had much less baggage, allowing him to secure victory.
</li><li> 2017: Tim Farron stepped down as leader, in part due to only being able to produce a mild improvement at the general election to twelve MPs, but more so because his personal beliefs came under attack for being opposed to most of the party's policies. It was initially treated as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">Foregone Conclusion</a> by most that Jo Swinson, who had just returned to Parliament after losing her seat in 2015, would succeed Farron and become the party's first female leader. However, she declined to contest the position and opted to become <em>deputy</em> leader instead. Norman Lamb was then tipped to make a second shot, but he instead nominated veteran MP and former interim leader Vince Cable, who had also just returned to Parliament, as leader. Cable ended up being elected unopposed. This instance later turned out to be a subversion, as it transpired that Swinson was pregnant when Farron stood down and didn't want to take on the party leadership at such a critical time, leading to suspicions that Cable had just agreed to act as effectively an interim leader. Said suspicions were borne out two years later when Cable stood down, and this time Swinson ran for the leadership and easily thrashed Sir Ed Davey — only to end up lasting barely six months as party leader, and being forced out after she lost her seat at the 2019 general election, leading to another leadership race which Davey won this time.
</li></ul></li><li> In by-elections:
<ul><li> Crosby in 1981. Held in a Conservative safe seat in Merseyside, it resulted with Shirley Williams (from the SDP-Liberal Alliance) winning the seat with nearly half the vote. In 1979, the predecessor Liberal Party had finished in third place in Crosby with 15% of the vote.
</li><li> Bermondsey in 1983. In 1979 the Liberals came in third place with less than 10% of the vote in a constituency where Labour won 60%; in a by-election weeks before the 1983 general, Liberal candidate Simon Hughes took the seat with 57% of the vote. Tragically, though, one of the reasons for Labour's loss was that their candidate Peter Tatchell (besides his radical left views) was openly gay, and later became famous as a gay activist. The Liberal campaign had a hint of homophobic scare stories behind it, but in 2006 Hughes revealed that he was bisexual.
</li><li> Bradford West in 2012. The seat had been Labour for many years and the by-election garnered little media attention as most expected a routine Labour hold. Instead, the outspoken George Galloway won the seat with a five-figure majority for the Respect Party.
</li></ul></li><li> Paul Nuttall was a relatively well-known UKIP politician for some time, but his becoming leader in 2016 might count. It all began in the summer, when Nigel Farage announced his intention to quit. Steven Woolfe became the frontrunner to succeed him ... until he failed to submit his nomination papers on time. Diane James subsequently won September leadership election ... and then announced her resignation just a couple of weeks later. Another leadership election was scheduled for November, with Steven Woolfe once again the favourite ... until he withdrew his name from consideration following an incident of violence during a meeting. Finally, Nuttall entered and easily won the contest.
<ul><li> The following year, Nuttall resigned after the party's vote collapsed at the general election. Several party veterans such as Peter Whittle, Jane Collins, and John Rees-Evans entered the race, but with the vote split seven ways it quickly appeared as though there would be a dark horse victor in the shape of Anne-Marie Waters, a far-right activist who ran on the express goal of reforming UKIP into an anti-Islam party, and whose supporters had reportedly joined the party en masse. The result was even <em>more</em> of a shock, as Waters finished second behind Henry Bolton, a previously obscure party member who won out largely thanks to having the important endorsement of Nigel Farage and much less baggage than the other candidates. Or so it seemed...
</li><li> After only five months, Bolton was ousted as leader after it turned out that, contrary to the "family man" image he put across in the leadership contest, he had left his wife shortly after becoming leader to date a model with views almost as far-right as Waters'. In the aftermath, potential candidates were David Kurten, who was the only contender aside from Bolton who didn't massively under-perform in the previous leadership election and/or quit the party afterwards, and Bill Etheridge, a two-time leadership contender, with some even predicting that Nigel Farage would make his long-tipped comeback. Instead, the party eschewed a formal leadership election and named acting leader Gerard Batten as permanent leader, widely thought to be because they <em>couldn't afford another leadership election</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The 1992 general election had an interesting example in the "first constituency to declare a result" race. In every general election between 1970 and 1987, the first constituency to declare had been either Guildford or Torbay, and they were ranked by bookmakers as the two most likely to declare first in 1992. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a> had cameras and live reporters at both venues in preparation for the first result, but just as Kate Adie was reporting from Torbay that the candidates, the Mayor, and the acting returning officer were taking the stage to announce the result, a red ticker appeared on the bottom of the screen reading "Lab hold Sunderland South" — a constituency to which the BBC had not even sent a camera crew.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16lucn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note16lucn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16lucn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">When David Dimbleby told Adie, a proud Mackem, that Torbay would now be second to declare, she described Sunderland as "a good city to be second to."</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ITV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ITV">ITN</a> did have a camera crew in Sunderland and aired the declaration live, although they had earlier acknowledged that Guildford and Torbay were the two favourites to declare first. This began a streak of being the first constituency to declare a result for Sunderland South and its successor constituency, Houghton and Sunderland South, that ended in 2017 (when it was beaten by Newcastle-upon-Tyne Central).
<ul><li> Newcastle declaring first in 2017 probably counts as an example in itself. The BBC were expecting that Sunderland, as usual, would declare the first result of the night ... and then David Dimbleby suddenly announced that Newcastle had beaten them.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a> example: In 63 BC, the Romans held an election for the highly prestigious post of Pontifex Maximus (essentially, the chief priest). Fashionable opinion during the campaign was that it boiled down to a contest between two very old, very influential ex-consuls, Quintus Lutatius Catulus and Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus, both typical candidates for the job. However, the two were too keen on the position (which was for life) to pull out and let the other take it, and wound up splitting the conservative, patrician vote... allowing a very young and then-unknown senator to score a sensational example of this trope. Still, surely the largely ceremonial position couldn't lead to any major revolution in Roman life? Well, maybe if the young senator in question weren't a certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar">Julius Caesar</a>.... (Over his career, Caesar would indeed frequently use his powers as Pontifex Maximus to great effect, manipulating the calendar to reward political allies and punish enemies, sidestep the efforts of his co-consul Bibulus to undermine his agenda, and ultimately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitSoHardTheCalendarFeltIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitSoHardTheCalendarFeltIt">give us the basic form of calendar we use today</a>.)
</li><li> Following the Liberal Party's defeat in the 2007 Australian election and John Howard's loss of his seat, Peter Costello was the favourite to take over the party leadership, with Malcolm Turnbull as a dark horse candidate. Costello announced he would not stand for leader, leaving Turnbull as the frontrunner. However, when the party voted on its new leader, Turnbull was defeated by Brendan Nelson.
<ul><li> It happened again in 2018, with Peter Dutton attempting to oust Turnbull as prime minister. After Turnbull lost a confidence vote and declined to run again, Dutton and Deputy Leader Julie Bishop ran for the leadership position, only for Scott Morrison to win as a compromise candidate.
</li></ul></li><li> A similar thing happened in Canada in 2006, where Stéphane Dion won the Liberal Party leadership instead of frontrunners Bob Rae and Michael Ignatieff. In '08, the party suffered its worst election in years, which was mostly blamed on Dion (not entirely unfair) and he was replaced by Ignatieff a few months later.
<ul><li> At the beginning of the 2015 election, the hype from Justin Trudeau's election as Liberal Party leader had worn off, and he was in third place in the polls behind the incumbent Conservatives led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the social democratic NDP led by Thomas Mulcair. The length of the campaign (78 days, which is very long by Canadian standards), however, worked against the two frontrunners by allowing more time for screw-ups and scrutiny of their platforms, while simultaneously allowing Trudeau to build up his credibility (which the Conservatives attacked repeatedly) and show off his platform. As a result, on election night, the Liberals were catapulted from third place with 36 seats to win 184 of the 338 seats in the House of Commons, allowing them to form a majority government with Trudeau as prime minister.
</li></ul></li><li> Going into the 2017 French presidential election, the ruling Socialists' chances of electing another president had been effectively ruined by incumbent François Hollande's disastrous unpopularity, and were further buried when the far-left Benoît Hamon was nominated as their candidate (he subsequently finished <em>fifth</em> in the first round). The competition was therefore mostly seen as a two-horse race between Republican candidate François Fillon and National Front candidate Marine Le Pen, with Fillon being considered the favorite, and victory for Le Pen being seen as unlikely, but not impossible. However, Fillon's chances were destroyed when a scandal erupted over his having given a bogus job to his wife to put her on the government payroll, while Le Pen could never quite shake off the far-right legacy of her party (which had seen her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, get completely obliterated when he found himself in the run-off vote 15 years prior). This therefore allowed Emmanuel Macron — a political outsider with only three years worth of political experience, who had never served in <em>any</em> elected office and had to form his own party in order to compete in the election — to outmanoeuvre the other three major candidates (plus Indomitable France candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who attracted some support from the Socialists due to coming across as a more competent and experienced version of Hamon, and finished a close fourth behind Fillon) and easily defeat Le Pen in the second round of voting.
<ul><li> Macron looked like a total dark horse at first glance, but he had the strongest financial support out of all the candidates, the largest media covering by far in the months preceding the election and his track record as Minister of the Economy of the Hollande government somehow wasn't brought up anywhere in major media outlets (let alone <em>being in the Socialist Party</em> beforehand and leaving it soon enough to survive its tanking). Being the only big candidate not to be dogged by a judicial affair during the campaign (something all the other major candidates were, which is puzzling in and of itself) and the stigma attached to the far right also helped. As soon as Fillon was marred in a scandal about his wife being paid for nonexistent jobs, Macron's victory was fairly predictable.
</li><li> Hamon and Fillon's nominations were themselves examples. The Socialist primary was originally thought to be a race between former Prime Minister Manuel Valls and former Finance Minster Arnaud Montebourg. However, Hamon gained support and managed to eliminate Montebourg in the first round and beat Valls in the second round. In the Republican primary, former Prime Minister Alain Juppé was seen as the frontrunner to win the nomination, with former President Nicolas Sarkozy projected to come in second in the first round. However, Fillon, also a former PM, managed to win an upset victory in the first round, knocking Sarkozy into third place, and proceeded to beat Juppé by a large margin in the second round.
</li></ul></li><li> Another Canadian example — the 1976 Progressive Conservative leadership election was split between frontrunners Flora Macdonald on the left and Claude Wagner on the right. The party chose the little-known 36-year-old Joseph Clark by 65 votes over Wagner, leading to the next-day memorable headline "Joe Who?" (In his first federal election in 1979, he led the PCs to a dark horse victory of their own and served as Prime Minister ... for nine months.)

<ul><li> The ultimate dark horse victory in sports has to be the 1980 USA men's hockey team coached by Herb Brooks. A group of college kids taking on all the best teams in the world, many with pros in their ranks, and winning the gold. Even the players for Team USA didn't think they had that great a chance, as team captain Mike Eruzione thought the team was only good enough to get bronze.
</li><li> Australian Steven Bradbury won a short track speed skating gold medal at the 2002 Winter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames">Olympic Games</a> after all the other competitors crashed. The Australian broadcaster, since it was Australia's first ever Winter Olympics gold medal (and first gold for any country in the Southern Hemisphere), still went ahead and did those <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneMadeAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneMadeAwesome">slow motion, glory replays</a>. In fact, "doing a Bradbury" has become Australian slang for this trope. He may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky">Born Lucky</a>; during his second heat, one racer was disqualified for interference, and in the semifinal, three of his opponents also crashed.
</li><li> Eric Moussambani Malonga, from Equatorial Guinea, appeared at the 2000 Sydney Olympics as part of a wildcard draw that allowed developing countries in to the games without meeting the minimum requirements. In his heat for the 100 meter free-style (and the first time Malonga had ever swam in a full-length pool), Malonga swam the course in 1'57'', the worst time for the event in Olympic history. However, since his two competitors false-started, Malonga was determined to have won his heat, and became a minor celebrity afterward.
</li><li> The 1992 Olympics provided the former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> in Robert Změlík of Czechoslovakia, who won the decathlon ... after American audiences had been treated to an ad campaign hyping <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_%26_Dave">Dan O'Brien and Dave Johnson<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the buildup to the games (Dan failed to qualify for those games but later won the gold in '96, while Dave took the bronze).
</li><li> The 1968 Olympics in Mexico City featured a number of firsts, the first Olympics in Latin America, a number of broken records for pole vault, long jump, triple jump, etc. But one thing that Mexicans are likely to remember is Felipe "el tibio" Muñoz Kapamas, the first, and so far, only Mexican athlete to ever win a gold medal in an Olympic swimming event. El Tibio, "The Timid One", got his nickname for his then-odd habit of refusing to swim in a nonheated pool and became famous for edging out both the Soviet and U.S. favorite and winning the 200m breaststroke.

Going into the Olympics, Wieber and Gabby Douglas were seen by most fans as the all-arounders of the team, while Raisman, though she was set to compete all four events in the qualifying round, was known more for her standout events (particularly floor exercise) than for the all-around. To nearly everyone's surprise (including her own), in the qualification, Raisman outscored <em>both</em> of her teammates, qualifying to the final in second place right behind Russia's Viktoria Komova, causing Wieber (who was also outscored by Douglas) to be bumped out of the final.
</li><li> The 2007 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a> World Championship had the two McLaren drivers, double World Champion Fernando Alonso and hotshot rookie Lewis Hamilton, locked in a bitter rivalry for the title crown. The Championship went all the way to the final race, with Hamilton leading and Alonso second favourite. However, Hamilton made a mistake and Alonso was unable to catch up with the Ferraris. At the end of the day, it was their Ferrari rival Kimi Räikkönen who won the race and the title. Alonso and Hamilton were <em>tied</em> for second.
<ul><li> 1986 had much of the same. Williams teammates double World Champion Nelson Piquet and English hero Nigel Mansell spew at each other all season, while Alain Prost comes from behind to take it, winning the season finale.
</li><li> 2010 had a similar outcome. A change in the points system and no dominant driver ensured a wide-open contest right to the end between no fewer than five drivers, including Alonso, Hamilton and Jenson Button who between them had won four of the past five titles. Coming to the final race, Fernando Alonso led from Australian Mark Webber, with Webber's teammate, German Sebastian Vettel third. Alonso had to come first or second to clinch the crown, whereas Webber needed to win with Alonso no higher than third, and a very much third-favourite Vettel needed to win and have Alonso come <em>fifth</em> or lower. In the event, Vettel won the race  and became champion when Alonso and Webber finished 7th and 8th. To make it even more this trope, despite the leadership of the drivers' championship changing many times over the course of the season, Vettel had not been leading it once all year until winning in the final race.
</li><li> This trope got preemptively <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a></em> by Vettel: when asked by a reporter if he thought he stood a chance of winning the title, Vettel noted that he was the first one to ask that, everyone else had just asked if he would help his teammate win the title away from Alonso.
</li></ul></li><li> Seems to happen often in racing themes; one inspiration could be the 1979 Daytona 500. Donnie Allison was leading Cale Yarborough in the last lap, Yarborough tried to pass, and they both wrecked, leaving down-by-half-a-lap <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardPetty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardPetty">Richard Petty</a> to win. Yarborough and Allison ended up discussing the incident in the infield using eloquent punches to the face, with brother Bobby Allison also joining in on the fun.
</li><li> An example from the world of football: in the 1993 Polish championship, frontrunners Legia Warsaw and ŁKS Łódź were accused of match-fixing so the title was awarded to third-placed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate">Lech Poznań</a>. Neither Legia nor ŁKS have forgiven Lech for this, but they never liked them much to begin with.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EuropeanChampionship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EuropeanChampionship">Euro '92</a> international <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">football</a> European Championships. Due to the eruption of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">Civil War</a> in Yugoslavia causing the country, a notable footballing power, to be removed from the tournament after they had qualified but before it could start, a replacement nation had to be drafted in at the last minute to make up the numbers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Denmark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Denmark">Denmark</a>, runners-up to the Yugoslavs in qualifying, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHopelessReplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHopelessReplacement">took their slot</a>. In an evenly-matched group stage they managed a goalless draw against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishFootyTeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishFootyTeams">England</a> before losing to local rivals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Sweden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Sweden">Sweden</a>. In the crucial last group game the unfancied Danes went up against big guns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/France" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/France">France</a> for what turned out to be a straight fight for second place (behind the Swedes) and a spot in the semi-finals, and sneaked through 2-1 after a late winner. Denmark then encountered defending champions the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNetherlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNetherlands">Netherlands</a> in the semis, and shockingly overturned them in a 5-4 penalty shootout victory. This pitted them against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Germany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Germany">Germany</a> in the final; the Germans remain one of the sport's perennial powerhouses and were the incumbent world champions, with Denmark winning. There was even a dark horse <em>scorer</em>, as in amongst an assembly of world-class striking talent it was Danish defensive midfielder John Jensen who netted their first goal in a 2-0 triumph  a man who otherwise managed just 3 international goals in nearly 80 matches across eight years, and who subsequent to this final would be signed by English giants Arsenal, where in 130-odd games he would famously score only <em>once</em>.
<ul><li> Twelve years later, Greece won the 2004 tournament over hosts Portugal, being carried by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a> game focused on defense (they scored only seven goals in six games, and their three wins in the knockout round were by 1-0).

Their weapons were fear and surprise and a ruthlessly efficient defense.

France failed to make the World Cup in 90 and 94 and got into the 98 tournament only by hosting it. They shocked the world with one of the most dominating defenses ever (one non-PK goal for the entire tournament) and capped off their improbable win with a 3-0 win over supposedly invincible Brazil in the final.
</li><li> For other continental soccer/football championships - we have Iraq winning the 2007 Asian Cup (not only during the War, but also overcoming multiple continental giants like newly admitted Australia, South Korea and Saudi Arabia) and Zambia taking home the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations after a long penalty shootout against the Ivory Coast and a victory against Ghana in the semifinals. The last of these doubles as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Heartwarming/RealLifeSports" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Heartwarming/RealLifeSports">CMOH</a>, seeing that the match was played just inland from the spot where the plane carrying the Zambia national team to a World Cup qualifier crashed in 1993, killing all on board.

</li><li> Denmark in the European handball championships 2012. Coming to the tournament, expected to be one of the fours team in the semi finals, they lose two matches in the preliminary round, going to the main round with 0 points, effectively making themselves underdogs. Denmark won the three matches on the main round, and with some other results going the right way (Macedonia beating Poland, Sweden having a draw against Poland, Poland beating Germany), the Danes ended up with 6 points, one ahead of Germany, Poland and Macedonia (who started the main round with 4, 2 and 1 point respectively - 2 points for a win). In the semi-final, the team that had played the best handball during the tournament were waiting, but Denmark had a one goal victory against Spain to go through to the final. In the final, home team Serbia were beaten.
<ul><li> In the following year, the Brazilian female team won the World Championship over the host Serbians. The team had been a rising force, but couldn't actually translate to podiums (in the 2004 Olympics, nearly upset South Korea in the quarterfinals as a fourth seed but lost by two goals; in the 2011 World Championship as hosts, lost the quarterfinals to Spain by one goal; and in the 2012 Olympics, won their group but faced defending champions Norway <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">who deliberately held their game back in Round 1</a> and eventually won by two goals).
</li><li> The 2016 win of Germany also came rather unexpectedly. While Germany had once been a perennial powerhouse and is a bankable market for fans and TV, they had been so bad that only making new rules up on the spot could get them into the previous world cup. While they did qualify regularly for the European Championship 2016, few people expected them to survive the first round, let alone win it all.
</li></ul></li><li> For the past decade and half, the "Big Four" of men's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis">tennis</a> — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RogerFederer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RogerFederer">Roger Federer</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RafaelNadal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RafaelNadal">Rafael Nadal</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NovakDjokovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NovakDjokovic">Novak Djokovic</a>, and Andy Murray — have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">so overwhelmingly dominant</a> at the Grand Slams that any outsider managing to win a single one qualifies for this trope:
<ul><li> Juan Martín del Potro's 2009 US Open win, which was the <em>only</em> time between 2006-13 that a Slam was not won by a Big Four member.
</li><li> Stan Wawrinka's 2014 Australian Open win, after years of him being only a second-tier player with a record of inconsistent performances. He would go on to add two more Slam singles trophies to his collection.
</li><li> Marin Čilić's 2014 US Open win. Raise your hand if you saw him — a player who had only one Slam semifinal on his resume way back in 2010 — straight-setting perennial top 10 player Tomas Berdych in the quarterfinals, Roger Federer in the semifinals (who he had <em>never</em> beaten before in 5 meetings), <em>and</em> Djokovic-slayer Kei Nishikori in the final to win the title. And then put your hand back down right away, because you are a lying liar.
</li></ul></li><li> For women's tennis, Serena Williams is so dominant and good at returning to form quickly even after long injury layoffs that the biggest shocks at Grand Slams have come when she's been upset by a player no one thought would be a threat to her or for the title:
<ul><li> The 2010 French Open was considered to be fairly wide open with predictions of the champion ranging from Serena Williams to Justine Henin to Jelena Janković. Even with this open field, however, almost no one predicted that Samantha Stosur would upset all three main contenders in her run to the final and literally no one on earth foresaw her final opponent, the little-known 17th seed Francesca Schiavone, turning in the performance of her life to become only the second non-top 10 female player in tennis history (the first one was in <em>1933</em>) to win the French Open <em>and</em> the first-ever Italian woman to win a Grand Slam title.
</li><li> At the 2013 Wimbledon championships, 99.99% of all tennis followers were waiting for Serena's foregone victory after she had spent the entire first half of the season <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curb-stomping</a> nearly everyone she played. 0.01% thought that there might be the faintest smidgen of a chance that Victoria Azarenka or Maria Sharapova, the closest things Serena had to rivals, could win instead. 0.0000% saw Marion Bartoli, seeded at a distant 15th in the tournament, winning after nearly all of the top players were upset in the first week.
</li><li> Serena came into the 2015 US Open going for a history-making calendar-year Grand Slam after winning the last 3 Slams. If you asked anyone beforehand if there was any player in the draw capable of upsetting her bid for the CYGS, exactly none of them would have answered, "Roberta Vinci, who's ranked a distant No. 43 and has a 0-4 head-to-head record against Serena, that's who!"... and yet, Vinci <em>did</em> upset Serena in the semifinals in easily one of the biggest sports upsets of all time. And the ultimate champion? 26th-ranked Flavia Pennetta, who had upset No. 2 Simona Halep in the other semifinal and went on to beat Vinci in the all-Italian final no one saw coming.
</li><li> At the 2018 US Open, Serena wasn't the <em>only</em> favorite for the title, but after the then-World No. 1 Simona Halep was upset in the first round and many other top-ranked players fell by the wayside, it looked like the trophy was destined for Serena who mowed through her draw with the loss of only one set. Then Naomi Osaka — who had won the Indian Wells tournament earlier that year, but had been wildly inconsistent in all the tournaments after that — routed her in the final. It probably didnt help that Serena received three crucial penalties.
</li></ul></li><li> The 2012 PGA Tour FedEx Cup championship. Entering the "playoffs" run, Tiger Woods was leading the race for the cup, but Rory McIlroy won the first two events to vault into the lead, setting up a "Tiger vs. Rory" narrative going into the final event, the Tour Championship. However, neither golfer played well in that event, allowing relative unknown Brandt Snedeker to take the FedEx Cup by winning the Tour Championship.
<ul><li> The 1991 PGA Championship. A complete unknown by the name of John Daly shocked the golfing world. The <em>ninth</em> alternate, he was only even allowed to participate after scores of other players were forced to withdraw for one reason or another. Come the end of the tournament, said complete unknown walked away the champion.
</li></ul></li><li> An even more out-of-nowhere story from golf was the 2020 Women's (British) Open Championship. Even though many top players were missing due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/COVID19Pandemic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/COVID19Pandemic">COVID-19</a> travel issues and health fears, there was still plenty of star power around. There was also late entry Sophia Popov, a German who entered the tournament with a world ranking of 304, without playing privileges on any top tour anywhere in the world, and who had nearly retired in 2019 due to her struggles at the top level.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18r9u4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note18r9u4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18r9u4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">On top of that, she later revealed that she was still suffering the aftereffects of a bout with Lyme disease several years earlier.</span> The month before, she had caddied for a friend at an LPGA Tour event in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ToledoOhio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ToledoOhio">Toledo, Ohio</a>. Popov took the lead early in Saturday's third round, and wasn't seriously threatened on her way to her first professional win. In a major, no less. A win that vaulted her into the world's <em>top 25</em>. Not to mention that she won five times as much in that one event as she had in <em>six years</em> on tour.
</li><li> The Czech national ice hockey team is usually very solid and never a true underdog. They were, however, underdogs in Winter Olympics Games in Nagano in 1998. The NHL allowed for the first time to have a break for the Olympics. The national teams could — for the first time ever — send their very best players and build all-star teams. Both Canada and the United States were heavily favoured as they had previously faced off in the final of the 1996 World Cup of Ice Hockey. However, the Czechs defeated the USA in the quarterfinal match. Canada lost to them in the semifinal match in the nerve-biting shoot-outs. The Czechs won the gold medal, beating Russia in the final.
</li><li> Foinavon pulled the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HorseRacing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HorseRacing">Horse Racing</a> equivalent of a Steve Bradbury when he cantered into the 1967 Grand National with odds of only 100/1 and ended up winning the race when all the other horses crashed at the 23rd fence and he was far enough behind them to avoid the pile-up.
</li><li> In harness racing, <a class="urllink" href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1068038/">one of the most anticipated races of all time<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was the 1988 March of Dimes Invitational Trot, featuring horses considered the best trotters in the world at the timeAmerican horse Mack Lobell and French horse Ourasi. Mack went to the lead, and held it until Ourasi pulled slightly ahead at the top of the stretch. The two then battled down the stretch, and were eye-to-eye on the lead with 20 yards left. The winner... Sugarcane Hanover.
</li><li> In 1986, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianRulesFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianRulesFootball">Australian Rules Football</a>'s highest individual honor, the Brownlow Medal, was won by Robert DiPierdomenico. In his acceptance speech, he said, "I gave myself no chance and only came along for the food".
</li><li> Amusingly, the Brazilian term for this is also on the equines, "Zebra" - due to <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jogo_do_Bicho">an animal-themed lotto<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where the striped horse is not one of the 25 options, so if the result was zebra...
</li><li> The 2014 Ohio State Football team had 10/1 Vegas odds of winning the National Championship. Then after they lost their starting quarterback, who was a Heisman candidate and 2-time conference player of the year, they became a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cleveland.com/osu/index.ssf/2015/01/odds_ohio_state.html">40/1 shot at winning the title.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> They had to start an untested freshman at quarterback. After their loss to Virginia Tech, the country basically buried any hopes of Ohio State making the playoffs. What happened? That 2nd-string quarterback broke all sorts of passing records and led the Buckeyes to an upset of a top 10 Michigan State team on the road. To make the run even more improbable, the 2nd-string quarterback got injured in the final game of the season. The 3rd-string quarterback had to step up and make his first start in the Conference Title Game! He promptly led the Buckeyes to a 59-0 victory over Wisconsin. Then they made the playoffs and beat the #1 ranked team in the country, Alabama, 42-35 and capped it off by demolishing the #2 ranked team in the country, Oregon, in the National Championship, 42-20! All with a guy who was behind two other guys for the starting position when the season started.
</li><li> One of the longest races in the world is the 566-mile (875 kilometer) Westfield Sydney to Melbourne Ultra Marathon. Amongst the contestants in 1983 was a potato farmer by the name of Cliff Young who—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName">despite his name</a>—was 61 years old at the time. When the starter gun went off, the other racers tore off while the old man shuffled along in his rainboots. Thing was, in a real-life version of The Tortoise And The Hare, the hares all bunked down to sleep—as was expected. Cliff Young did not; he simply kept going for <em>nearly six days straight</em>, setting an all-time record for best time. Trainers studied the "Young Shuffle" and realized that while the pace was slow, it was efficient, letting someone run for much longer periods of time. Three other racers used his running style to win the Ultra Marathon.
</li><li> In the 2015 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndyCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndyCar">Indy Car</a> season, Juan Pablo Montoya was basically champion apparent for most of it, having a commanding lead and the Indy 500 under his belt. Then a few blunders on his part and rallying on Graham Rahal's part saw Rahal be a serious challenger for that title. So who won it? Scott Dixon. He won the final race of the season, which, thanks to it being worth double the points, gave him enough points to tie Montoya-and his three wins to Montoya's two gave him the win. This victory, predictably, was not without its controversy, with Montoya angry that Dixon only tied because of the double points (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">ignoring that he himself got double points for winning Indy</a>).
</li><li> In the NFL Playoffs, the Wild Card teams have the toughest route to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a>, especially the sixth (and final) seeds, since the Wild Card round with 5 teams from each conference format was officially added in 1978 and expanded to 6 teams per conference in 1990. The main difficulty comes from having to potentially win three playoff games on the road, and only two sixth-seed teams have done so and won the Super Bowl. The 2005 Pittsburgh Steelers had to snap a three-game losing streak and win their final four games <em>just</em> to even make the AFC playoffs with an 11-5 record. From there, they defeated their bitter rivals, the Cincinnati Bengals, 31-17; survived a scare against the No. 1 seeded Indianapolis Colts, 21-18; and then blew out the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship Game, 34-17. In the process, the Steelers became the first sixth seed to beat the top three teams on the road. They then defeated the favored Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XL, 21-10, for their fifth Lombardi Trophy. Oddly enough, five years later, the Steelers would see a sixth-seed win the Super Bowl <em>against</em> them, falling to the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XLV. The 2010 Packers made the playoffs with a 10-6 record, aided by the Philadelphia Eagles knocking the New York Giants out of playoff-contention in the famous "Miracle at the New Meadowlands." The Packers then beat the Eagles, blew out the Atlanta Falcons, then beat their historic rival the Chicago Bears in the NFC Championship Game before knocking off Pittsburgh in the Super Bowl, 31-25. Other wild card Super Bowl winners include the 1980 Oakland Raiders, the 1997 Broncos (who actually got to play a home game), the 2000 Baltimore Ravens, and most famously, the #5 seed 2007 New York Giants, best known for defeating the New England Patriots 17-14 in Super Bowl XLII, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatingTheUndefeatable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatingTheUndefeatable">denying the Patriots</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondPlaceIsForLosers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondPlaceIsForLosers">a perfect 19-0 season</a>.
</li><li> The 201516 season of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishPremierLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishPremierLeague">English Premier League</a>. Since 2000 the league has normally been dominated by the most popular and best-funded teams: Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and more recently Manchester City. The league itself is the 3rd richest sports league of any kind in the world and it's only getting richer. Meanwhile, Leicester City had returned to the Premier League in 2014 for the first time in ten years. Their entire first team cost £22 million, the going rate for a top class winger/striker. They spent most of the 2014-15 season battling against relegation, eventually finishing 14th out of 20 due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiracleRally" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiracleRally">Miracle Rally</a> in the last two months when they won 7 of their last 9 matches. In the 2015-16 season, <em>they won the league</em>. At the start of the season, the odds of this happening were <em>5,000-1</em>, the same as those given for <em>finding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a> alive</em>. What's particularly astounding is that while most dark horse victories in sports happen in the space of a single match, to win a league requires a strong sustained performance. This endeavor was aided by the fact that the 'bigger' teams all had an atypically bad season in general, allowing underdogs Leicester to get an early lead in the run up to Christmas, and then keeping that momentum for the rest of the season. Leicester only lost three league games all season, once against Liverpool on Boxing Day, which temporarily dethroned them from the summit for the week, and twice against eventual runners-up Arsenal. Defending champions Chelsea meanwhile had a horrific season, ending up mid-table instead of the top four.
<ul><li> An even bigger DHV would have been a bet on not only Leicester winning the 2016 league, but that Donald Trump would win the 2016 US Presidency and that the UK would vote 'Leave' on the 2016 EU Referendum, with the bet being placed in <em>August 2015</em>. By itself, the Title would be 5000-1, but combining it with those other outcomes would push it to over 30000-1. According to news outlets, the expected return on a £10 wager would be in the eight-figure region, with some claiming as high as <strong>£30 million</strong> for the lucky bet.
</li></ul></li><li> Individual honor example: As the 1991 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague">National Football League</a> season came to a close; it was widely expected that the league rushing title would go to either Buffalo Bills running back Thurman Thomas or Detroit Lions running back Barry Sanders<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note19hdy3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note19hdy3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note19hdy3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">interestingly, both players had been college teammates at Oklahoma State, with Sanders serving as Thomas' backup before Thurman graduated</span>, with the rushing championship expected to be settled in the regular-season finale pitting Thomas' Bills and Sanders' Lions. Instead, Buffalo (having clinched the AFC East division, a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs) elected to rest their starters; thus Thurman didn't play at all in the game, while Sanders finished with 108 yards and a touchdown as the Lions defeated Buffalo 17-14 in overtime<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note20rups');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note20rups" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note20rups');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Unlike Buffalo, the Lions still had something to play for as Detroit needed a win and a loss by the Chicago Bears to the San Francisco 49ers - themselves out of the playoffs despite a 10-6 record due to the NFC playoff picture being especially crowded that season and having lost the head-to-head tiebreaker to the Atlanta Falcons - on the following evening's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MondayNightFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MondayNightFootball">Monday Night Football</a></em> game - to clinch the NFC Central title and the 2nd NFC first-round bye. The 49ers would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">throttle</a> Chicago 52-14 the next night.</span>. The winner of the rushing crown? Dallas Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith, who raced for 160 yards and 2 touchdowns as the Cowboys defeated Atlanta 31-27; giving Smith a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1991/leaders.htm">15-yard advantage<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> over Sanders with 1563 yards to Sanders' 1548 in what marked the first of four rushing titles in a five-year span for Emmitt; while Thurman came in a distant third with 1407 yards.

The MVP was expected to be one of two players having still-historic seasons: Wilt Chamberlain of the Philadelphia Warriors, with his historic 50 points a game scoring and Oscar Robertson of the Cincinnati Royals, who averaged a "Triple Double" - 30.8 points, 12.5 rebounds and 11.4 assists - for the season (a feat not matched until Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook, 55 years later). The MVP winner? Bill Russell of the Boston Celtics, whose personal stats were inferior to Chamberlain's and Robertson's, but was the best player on the league's best team.
</li><li> This happened twice in the IAAF World Championships London 2017. First was the 100m sprint, where everyone was expecting Usain Bolt to win by a country mile. He didn't. Instead, he came third overall with the US' Justin Gatlin and Christian Coleman taking the gold and silver medal respectively, making it his first bronze medal since the World Athletics Final in 2006. However, the real surprise then came later at the 4x100 Metres Relay. In that race, not only was Usain Bolt running for Jamaica, but his US rivals were on the US team as well. But in a shock turn of events, not only did Great Britain win gold overall (the first time they'd done so in their entire history), but Usain Bolt outright failed to finish the race, falling victim to an injury just as his leg of the race began. As a result, it was literally the first time Bolt had ever not gotten a medal in a race, and perhaps the most unfortunate end to an athlete's career in history.
</li><li> The famous 1990 boxing match between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikeTyson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikeTyson">Mike Tyson</a> and challenger James "Buster" Douglas. At the time, Tyson was the undisputed and undefeated champ. Coming into the bout with 3 titles. Douglas was a veritable unknown, seen as little more than a snack for a returning Tyson. The odds agreed, with the fight famously showing the odds of victory at 42-1. The boxing world was suitably shocked when the challenger not only beat Tyson, he beat him by <em>knockout</em>.
</li><li> Derrike Cope's first career <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR">NASCAR</a> victory in the 1990 Daytona 500 proved to be this, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DaleEarnhardt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DaleEarnhardt">Dale Earnhardt</a> had led most of that race and held the lead going into the final lap only for Earnhardt's car to run over a piece of bell housing from the blown engine of Rick Wilson's car - resulting in Earnhardt (seeking his first Daytona 500 victory) finishing the race with a cut tire while Cope passed him en route to Victory Lane.
</li><li> The 2019 St. Louis Blues: at the beginning of the year they were <em>dead last</em> in the points standings, but after a rally (that started with a coach change and the calling up of goaltender Jordan Binnington) that got them to the playoffs, they rode that all the way to the Stanley Cup finals, getting their first win ever.

<ul><li> This actually occurred with a test. The question was, "Who was the longest-lived English Ruler?", allowing a choice of four British monarchs. The actual answer wasn't even on the test: Richard Cromwell, who died less than four months short of his 86th birthday, even though he ruled England for only nine months. (He also technically wasn't a monarch, which perhaps explains why he was left off the list — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">though it doesn't excuse it</a>. He's since been surpassed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HMTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HMTheQueen">Elizabeth II</a>.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope">Pope John XXIII</a> ascended to the papacy in 1958 as a distinct long-shot — so much so that he had already purchased his train ticket home before entering the conclave. The two front-runners consistently deadlocked through the conclave, so it was eventually determined that a compromise candidate was needed to move the process forward. After garnering no better than 17% of the votes through nine ballots, John XXIII became Pope two ballots later with 76% of the votes.
</li><li> In the 1877 Leipzig chess tournament, the surprising winner was Louis Paulsen, an aging master who came out ahead of both Adolf Anderssen and Johannes Zukertort, considered to be the favorites.
</li><li> The 1994 Winter Olympics figure skating ladies' singles event was widely seen beforehand as a showdown between Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan, both of the USA, not least because of the scandal when it turned out that Harding's ex-husband had orchestrated a physical attack on Kerrigan in an attempt to put her out of the competition. (The subject of the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ITonya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ITonya">I, Tonya</a></em>.) However, the dramatic story was slightly spoiled when the competition was won by Oksana Baiul of Ukraine. Kerrigan took silver, Harding placed eighth.
</li><li> Few names conjure as much fear in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Battlebots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Battlebots">Battlebots</a></em> as Tombstone. A sturdy force of destruction who came into the revival's 1st season on Discovery as both reigning champ, #1 seed and 4-0. On the opposite end was Bombshell. Who had been tossed around all season, lost every match and only managed to squeak into the tourney in a desperado tournament. Suffice to say fans, drivers and even the announcers were shocked when Bombshell took out Tombstone's weapon chain. Leaving the champ with no weapon, and sending Bombshell onward.
</li><li> Adidas and Puma have dominated the athletic clothing sector since they were founded by the Dassler brothers (separately) after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo">World War II</a>. However, the old family rivalry continued to be the focus even among the brothers' descendants, which occasionally ran contrary to doing what was best for the business. For a while this drove the competition and only ensured the companies' dominance. But eventually they got bogged down by the rivalry, which allowed a relatively small American company called Nike to come in and overtake them. Nike is still number one.

<p></p><h2>Examples of the "Hey, at least the other guy didn't win" variation</h2>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder24');">    Fictional </div><div class="folder" id="folder24" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://ynnen.blogspot.com/2005/08/king-is-dead-long-live-king-kingmaking.html">This essay<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on variations of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingmakerScenario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingmakerScenario">Kingmaker Scenario</a> calls this "The Vendetta" - whatever the reason, Alice has adopted an attitude of "I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure Bob doesn't win". Alice no longer cares about winning the game - she just wants revenge on Bob.
</li><li> This trope formed the basis of a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Doonesbury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Doonesbury">Doonesbury</a></em> storyline in the 1970s. A congressional race is going on between Ginny Slade, Lacey Davenport, and a corrupt incumbent. Ginny has the support of most of the cast, as well as a song written about her by rock star Jimmy Thudpucker. However, people are torn between her and Lacey, leaving the incumbent with the full support of his party and coming out ahead. In the end Ginny realizes that Lacey is really the more qualified candidate and withdraws from the race to support her rather than let the incumbent take the race. Lacey wins and serves in congress for many years in the strip.
</li><li> The film <em>The Ringer</em> makes "the other guy didn't win" a <em>plot point</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FostersHomeForImaginaryFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FostersHomeForImaginaryFriends">Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends</a></em>, "Hiccy Burp", sees Bloo and another imaginary friend named Blake Superior have a showdown with hiccups and burps (and yes, it's every bit as disgusting as it sounds) in a pageant. After some armpit noise making friend wins, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTag">The Tag</a> shows him hiccuping while expressing how glad he is that Blake lost.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em>, "Grand Prix": Arnold, Sid, Stinky, and Eugene's go-kart (with Eugene behind the wheel) finishes second in a race. He's content with this, Sid and Stinky are mad they didn't win, while Arnold is glad that they at least beat Edmund and Wolfgang.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatDog">CatDog</a></em>, "Climb Every CatDog": Cat is determined to beat his rival Mindy Wonderful at climbing Mt. Nearburg so that it will be renamed after him. Cat manages to beat Mindy, but it turns out that Dunglap was waiting at the top for him to give him his gear he forgot at the store. Dog takes it in stride, but Cat doesn't and breaks down crying.
<div class="indent"><strong>Dog:</strong> Cat, look at the bright side. Mindy isn't better than you anymore...Dunglap is.

Professor Childermass is a die-hard fan of the Boston Red Sox, and has a burning hatred of the New York Yankees. At the end of the book, during a game between the two, Professor Childermass surprises everyone by congratulating one of the Yankees on a good play... but then loudly points out that the Yankees are still six and a half games behind the Cleveland Indians, earning chuckles out of his friends and the other Red Sox fans nearby.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder25');">    Sports </div><div class="folder" id="folder25" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Yes, the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Boston Red Sox in the 2008 ALCS, but the mere fact that they were both there means the New York Yankees finally missed the playoffs! Victory for Red Sox Nation! No, seriously.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball">Dodgers and the Giants</a> ARE this trope. Over the course of a bitter, hundred-plus year rivalry (which has seen them both move from New York to California), fans of both teams take nearly as much joy in playing spoiler for whichever one of the teams is in position to win the division or make the playoffs as they do winning for themselves. The Giants beat the Dodgers 2 out of 3 games to end the season and cost the Dodgers the NL West title in '91, only for the Dodgers to return the favor in '93. And both times, the eventual division winner were the Braves. And that's only one example out of many.
</li><li> The 1973 World Series featured the New York Mets with an 82-79 win-loss record and a .509 winning percentage barely squeaking past the other NL East division teams with a series of wins in September, upsetting the NL West champion Cincinnati Reds with a 99-63 record and .611 winning percentage 3 games to 2 in the NLCS, only to lose to the Oakland Athletics in the '73 World Series, 4 games to 3.
</li><li> San Jose Sharks fans did not mind missing the 2014-2015 NHL Playoffs, as their mortal enemies, the Los Angeles Kings, missed the playoffs as well. Vice versa for Kings fans.
</li><li> Arsenal fans cheered when Leicester City won the Premier League in 2016, as this prevented the hated Spurs from winning the league that year.
</li><li> Barcelona player Gerard Pique rooted for Juventus in the 2014-15 UEFA Champions League semifinal, despite facing (and defeating) them later in the subsequent final, as Juve faced none other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Real Madrid</a>. It's safe to say that Pique will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">cheer for any team that beats Real in any competition</a>, even if the same team beats Barca or is above them in the league.
