Sometimes, we feel the strong need to keep our love secret from the object of our affection, for various reasons.

The attempts that we have already made were all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MomentKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MomentKiller">suddenly interrupted</a>. The fear of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrequitedLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrequitedLove">rejection</a> is also a powerful deterrent to spilling your heart out.
</p><p>Thank God there are extraneous factors that force us to shout our love to the heavens after we've been pushed around. Otherwise, how would romance work?
</p><p>Anguished Declarations of Love are gender neutral in terms of occurrence but have a different flavour depending on whether the declarer is male or female: a male declarer will often be aggressive and reproachful in his confession, especially if his target of affection doesn't react the way he expects them to, in which case he may <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfICantHaveYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfICantHaveYou">demand to be loved back</a>.

A female declarer is often much more subdued in her confession and will admit her feelings sheepishly but a lash out isn't unheard of. Expect said lashing out to be rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenderTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenderTears">teary</a>, even heart-wrenching if done well.

When they come halfway through a work, they must usually be repeated again at the climax so that they can be accepted.
</p><p>Be warned: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoFinalConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoFinalConfession">deathbed confessions of undying love all too often turn out not to be actual deathbeds</a>. There is a very real possibility you will live to face the consequences of your confession. This may be a Good Thing or a Bad Thing.
</p><p>In real life, it's probably a much better move to just, y'know, ask someone on a date and see where it goes from there.

Kojima does accept his feelings, saying he thinks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItsYouItsOkay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItsYouItsOkay">he might love him back</a>, and says they can still be friends but only on the grounds that Nakahara doesn't do anything "weird" until he's sure he loves him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AwkwardSilence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AwkwardSilence">Awkward Silence</a></em> baseball ace Tamiya asks out the shy artist Toono, but becomes more and more distressed as he takes Toono's natural emotionless appearance as a sign <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">his feelings are unrequited</a>.

</li><li> Several examples in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> When Sasuke sets out to betray the village, Sakura confesses her love for him and tells him that she is willing to leave with him and betray the village just so they can stay together. His response is "you're annoying", followed by a "thank you", followed by whacking her on the back of the neck and rendering her unconscious. Even today, years after this happened, people are <em>still</em> not entirely sure what he meant by that; it's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho">Ironic Echo</a> of a conversation that moments before he denied remembering, and he later carries her to a park bench instead of just leaving her to lie on the ground. This suggests he wasn't being <em>completely</em> cruel to her, but was stopping her from taking his dark path. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistJourneyToVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistJourneyToVillain">Back then</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This initial confession receives a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> when Sakura begs him not to fight Naruto and confesses her love a final time. Sasuke knocks her out with a genjutsu of him impaling her with a Chidori, then sneers to Naruto and Kakashi that she was a deluded fool clinging to a fantasy and that he had no idea why she'd fallen for him in the first place. After Naruto beats some sense into him, Sasuke begins to reciprocate her feelings and they eventually get married.</span>
</li><li> In the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour">Darkest Hour</a>, Hinata rushes to protect Naruto from Pain, leaping into a hopeless situation just to buy him time.

Then Pain stabs her in the back before we can hear his response—which we don't get until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLastNarutoTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLastNarutoTheMovie">The Last: Naruto the Movie</a></em> two years later.

However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseConfession">she genuinely doesn't mean it</a>, and she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakHisHeartToSaveHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakHisHeartToSaveHim">just wants him to stop suffering because of her</a>. This results in Naruto easily seeing right through her, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">calling her out for lying</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking">rejecting her outright</a> by telling her that he <strong>hates</strong> people who lie to themselves.

<ul><li> Tessa also directly confesses her love for Sousuke in <em>The Second Raid</em> OVA. He misunderstands it brilliantly, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint">typical Sousuke fashion</a>.
</li><li> Later on in the novels, Sousuke and Kaname <em>finally</em> get their chance to declare their love for each other as well—while on <em>an open radio frequency</em>. Everybody that counts in both Mithril <em>and</em> Amalgam hears them—including Leonard and Tessa. While (in the original Japanese) Kaname uses a <em>slightly</em> more temperate expression of love, Sousuke goes straight for the "aishiteru" formula—the very same that Gauron had thrown at him during the above-mentioned suicide attempt, and actually the most serious one in Japanese language. Sousuke gets mercilessly teased by Kurz and Mao afterwards—Kaname is still a prisoner of Leonard so she has it worse, as Leonard actually <strong>beats her up</strong>. Leonard is a <em>very</em> sore loser, unfortunately
</li><li> Sousuke actually gave his own desparate declaration even earlier when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leonard attacks Jindai High School</span>, trying to clarify to a despondent Kaname as best he can exactly what his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IUhYouToo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IUhYouToo">"mission"</a> is.

</li><li> River to the Eleventh Doctor in "The Wedding of River Song." Although "By so many, and so much, and by no-one more than me." seemed to have a slightly better success rate than the usual.

The Doctor himself isn't particularly anguished, but Clara is.
</li><li> "The Girl Who Died" contains another indirect example. The Doctor, having caused the death of a young girl in order to save a town, expresses to Clara the anguish he expects should he ever lose her:
<div class="indent"> <strong>The Doctor</strong>: Look at you, with your eyes, and your never giving up, and your anger, and your kindness.

</li><li> River delivers another one, this time in front of the Twelfth Doctor, in "The Husbands of River Song." When the villains demand she tell them where the Doctor is, she says she doesn't know, because while she loves him, someone as grand as him could never love her, just like the stars themselves don't love her. "You don't expect a sunset to admire you back!" Just as she's ranting about how the <em>last</em> place you'd expect to find him is right next to her when she's in danger, she realizes that the strange man she's been adventuring with for the past few hours is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor">the newest incarnation of the Doctor</a>.
