But no one lives forever...
</p><p>But it's OK! If it's a monarchy, the line of succession is safe, or the king has chosen an agreeable replacement beforehand; if not, there are proper democratic (or at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectiveMonarchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectiveMonarchy">elective</a>) mechanisms in place for selecting a new leader. The old makes way for the new...

</p><p>This trope is about when a superb or at least markedly superior leader passes away, retires or occasionally gets killed off, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">possibly by the guy or gal who gets the top spot</a>, and is replaced by someone who is markedly inferior. Markedly inferior can range from just not being as competent to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">akin to the worst excesses of insane leaders throughout history</a>.
</p><p>Reasons for this trope being deployed vary. Sometimes it simply showcases the problem of having an experienced leader suddenly get replaced by someone who hasn't got the hang of things yet; that leader may show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> and improve. Sometimes the new leader <em>is</em> fairly competent under normal circumstances, but his father was a genius at war, or intrigue, or even just keeping the wolves from the door, which applies especially to CEOs, and the circumstances are most assuredly <em>NOT</em> optimal. If this is the case, if the new ruler is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a>, he again will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">eventually come up to the mark,</a> albeit with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHerosJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHerosJourney">a lot of problems and challenges along the way.</a> Unless it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a> of course. If he is <em>not</em> the main character, then it will be up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> to guide the new leader or at least ensure he doesn't screw up too badly... or maybe the new king will be the reason for the country/whatever collapsing, the villain winning initially, and the heroes will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a>, stemming from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel">Prequel</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a>. Sometimes something in the bloodline will hit the new ruler, leaving him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp">Royally Screwed Up</a>. Sometimes the new leader is just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AChildShallLeadThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AChildShallLeadThem">young child</a>, in which case the regent(s) are the ones who are likely to be incompetent and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife">self-serving</a>. And, of course, there's always the chance the new ruler will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">a bloodthirsty tyrant</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">just insane</a> and will prove to be the <em>villain</em> of the piece, or an obstacle for the hero to overcome to defeat the <em>real</em> villain.

Rulers gain near-immortality on accession (for themselves as well as their family and retainers), so a successful reign may continue indefinitely. Not all rulers are successful, however: Youko's predecessor only ruled for about 6 years before committing suicide to save her kirin from her own incompetence. By comparison, the wise and even-handed En-Ou has ruled for more than 500 years.

While she was very good at her job, her first time breaking the rules, she is caught and immediately replaced by Maria Hill. Nick was able to keep secret agendas and plans secret for years.
<ul><li> Similarly, Maria Hill, when replacing Nick Fury was this. She always worked within the system, which meant she could never do quite as good a job as Nick. The world went to crap on her watch. She got better over time, but still is very much inferior to Nick.

The title character, who used to be cruel, has learned to be a good person, and found out that he is the king.

From then on only Heralds - chosen by Companions for positive traits like honesty and courage - could inherit the throne, ensuring a minimum degree of competency and benevolence for future rulers.

<ul><li> The Targaryen family tree are full of these, causing several civil wars, in-house plotting and weak monarchs that left more powers in the hands of the feudal lords. The last one was Aerys II, who sparked a civil war that lost the Targaryens the throne (and most of their lives as well).
<ul><li> Perhaps the most notable example was the transition from Viserys II to Aegon IV. Although the former was not on the throne very long, he was a valuable advisor to his brother Aegon III and king in all but name during the reigns of his nephews Daeron I (The Young Dragon, who got 50,000 men killed trying to conquer a desert and died at 16 without heirs) and Baelor (The Blessed, who refused to marry and spent his whole reign praying rather than actually doing anything kingly); and is generally considered to be the third best king to seat the Iron Throne (After his great-great-grandfather Jaehaerys I, who led the realm through the dangerous period of being past the initial founder but not being sufficiently established to truly hold together, and grandson Daeron II, who defused the most dangerous rebellion the realm ever faced and ruled wisely for many years). Viserys' son (And father to the excellent Daeron II in an inverted example) Aegon IV, however, was obese, greedy, fathered dozens of bastards all over the place, and directly caused the rebellion that Daeron had to stop by legitimizing all of them. He might not have been as bad as Aerys II or Joffrey, but going from the third best to the third worst out of the twenty monarchs to sit the throne is the biggest change of any of them.

His son Caledor the Warrior was a great warrior and...well that's it. His rule is mostly known for a bloody and pointless war with the dwarfs that he ensured (Dark elves attacked a dwarven caravan disguised as high elves. In an unusual show of reasonableness the dwarfs sent an ambassador to talk about this and Caledor responded by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">having him shaved</a></em> and sending him home in disgrace). The war left thousands on both sides dead, completely cut the high elves off from their mainland colonies, ended with Caledor slain in single combat with the Dwarven king, and ruined any hope of cooperation between the races. This was the first and definitely the last time the elves named the son of the previous Phoenix King as his successor.
<ul><li> The Conqueror's other son Imladrik the Dragonlord was much more competent than his brother but had no interest in taking the throne, even telling lords plotting to put him there that he would refuse it. This ended up not really working out for him, as he was killed by Prince Morgrim Dragonsbane during the war his brother started. Ironically, his own son was also a Sketchy Successor despite being generally a good person and fairly competent because the position that he was the successor to was that of Master of Dragons and he was unable to get one let him ride it.
</li><li> Another good example can be found in the succession of Sigmarite Emperors. While Ludwig II - "Ludwig the Fat" - was considered capricious and was renowned for his gluttonous appetites, he nevertheless allowed the Halflings of the Moot representation by separating the Moot from the neighbouring provinces of Stirland and Averland and by allowing their Chief Elder (and later the Grand Theogonist of the Cult of Sigmar) onto the Electoral Council, allowing them a voice in deciding the next Emperor. His successor, Boris Goldgather, however, has no redeeming action to his name, having proved to be the worst of the Emperors elected from the Drakwald province and possibly the worst Emperor in general, bankrupting the Empire with his ludicrous expenses, fracturing it by pitting Elector Counts against each other and weakening its armies drastically. Under Boris's reign, the Empire was completely unprepared for the plague and later Skaven invasion. It was considered a silver lining in the Empire when the plague killed him.
</li></ul></li><li> This is pointed out as a worry of King Boranel of Breland in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em>. It's not that his sons are bad people or <em>in</em>competent, but they just aren't up to Boranel's impressive stature. This normally wouldn't have been all that important (balancing the monarch is one of the reasons Parliament exists, after all) if Boranel didn't have to worry if Breland hadn't gotten excessively dependent on him in the dark decades at the end of the Last War (there is a dark side to being very popular, after all). He has reason to worry, too — even if his sons were as competent and charismatic as he is, several factions have timed their schemes to go off whenever Boranel dies specifically so they don't have to deal with him, meaning that whoever inherits will be immediately thrust into an unstable and dangerous situation.

Stefan the Strong, turned the Serbian Kingdom into the Serbian Empire, setting it up as the successor to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire">Byzantine Empire</a> as the next hegemon of Southeastern Europe. His son, Stefan Uros V a.k.a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">the Weak</a>, was well-meaning but could not keep his unruly vassals together, leading to the Serbian Empire's premature demise.
</li><li> An Aversion: Nobody expected <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor">Edward VII</a> to be any good as a King: as Prince of Wales, he was a dissolute playboy who drank and smoked a lot, got caught up in a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_baccarat_scandal">gambling scandal<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, had more mistresses than you can shake a stick at, and was seen as unhealthily fond of France, French manners, French food, and above all of French prostitutes (he famously had a "love chair" at one of Paris' most notorious high-class brothels for the express purpose of supporting himself while he took two prostitutes at once). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">Also, he was a gourmand</a> and was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdiposeRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdiposeRex">tremendously fat</a>. He once appeared as a witness in a divorce trial in which the husband alleged the wife had cheated on him with the Prince (triply scandalous on its own—the Prince is not only accused of having an affair with a married woman, but then he has to <em>testify</em> about it, <em>and</em> it's a divorce trial to boot—made quadruple so by the fact that the husband was an MP and the Prince apparently visited the wife during sittings of Parliament). He also had several mistresses in succession. So, when after decades of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Queen Vicky</a>'s rule, Edward became King, everyone looked at him with a skewed eye...and proceeded to thank God when he showed he knew his place as King and actually became of great help to the Government, particularly in foreign affairs (his great love of all things French and extensive network of contacts in France set the groundwork for the <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entente_cordiale">entente cordiale<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>—he had been authorised to talk to the French about an alliance against Germany as early as <em>twenty years</em> before his accession, and he kept at it until the agreements were signed). None of this kept him from continuing to have as much fun as he could manage throughout his nine-year reign (down to continuing to fairly openly live with his mistress, Alice Keppel), but nobody really minded because he was such a good monarch otherwise.
<ul><li> Edward VII's son George V became a well-loved monarch, guiding the country through the First World War and sitting on the throne when the British Empire reached its greatest extent, becoming the largest empire in human history covering almost 25% of the entire planet's land, and successfully bringing the monarchy closer to the ordinary people of the UK. <em>His</em> eldest son, Edward VIII, however, fell into the trope hard. Before his death, George knew that his second son, Albert, and Albert's daughter Elizabeth (who wasn't even a teenager yet) would be far better monarchs. Given that Albert is better known as King George VI and Elizabeth II is the longest reigning monarch in British history, while Edward VIII ended up abdicating and being regarded as a Nazi sympathizer, he had good judgment.
</li><li> To add to the point above. George VI had not been groomed or trained for the throne, and had a well documented stammer in his early life. Thankfully the latter was treated with the help of Lionel Logue. The former raised doubts among the government about if he was suitable to rule, but the support of his wife (also called Elizabeth) helped convince them he could manage the job. This proved to be well founded. Their leadership and refusal to flee the country during World War II earned them the eternal devotion and admiration of the British people, and his devotion to duty is continued by Queen Elizabeth II herself, who is also quite beloved and respected by many. Sadly, the stress of the war and his smoking is what contributed to his early death in 1952 at just 56 years old.
</li></ul></li><li> A subtle but serious case that overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeterPrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeterPrinciple">The Peter Principle</a>; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueBlood">FitzRoy James Henry Somerset</a>, later 1st Baron Raglan, spent much of his life as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModernMajorGeneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModernMajorGeneral">perfectly competent chief aide</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDukeOfWellington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDukeOfWellington">The Duke of Wellington</a>. As the latter was regarded in Britain, with some reason, as a supreme military badass, it was assumed that Raglan had learned a bit, which would help explain why he was appointed to command the British forces in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CrimeanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CrimeanWar">the Crimean campaign</a>. Unfortunately, what Raglan had actually learned was how to be chief <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidekick">sidekick</a> to a genius <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">Control Freak</a>; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordErrorProne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordErrorProne">he had no significant experience of actually being in charge</a>. This may explain something about the Crimean War.
</li><li> The Royal Italian Army had one of the most painful examples ever: the succession of general Alberto Pollio as the chief of staff. Pollio was a capable manager and commander, and upon his death was succeeded by Luigi Cadorna, an equally capable manager and an infamously crappy commander (notably, he was supposed to command a corps in the invasion of Libya during the Italian-Turkish War but was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">crushed</a> in a wargame <em>rigged to give him victory</em> by general Carlo Caneva, who stole him the command and proceeded to became infamous for cowardice and general imbecility). When Italy later joined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, the Royal Italian Army would suffer for over two years against the better-led Austro-Hungarians before Cadorna got finally sacked.
<ul><li> Most notably, the ones who cried the most for Pollio's death were the <em>Austro-Hungarian government and general staff</em>: Pollio was known for being a supporter of the Triple Alliance that at the time bound Italy with Germany and Austria-Hungary, and his sudden death right before the war and his replacement with a known hater of Austria-Hungary allowed the Italian government to stay neutral at the start of the war and then enter it on the other side.
</li></ul></li><li> Louis XVIII might be seen as a step-down from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoléon Bonaparte</a>, but he was intelligent enough to understand that he needed to rein in the ultra-Royalists and reconcile the French after the Revolutionary turmoil. When he died in 1824, however, his brother Charles X proved to be as incompetent and intransigent as everyone had feared - he was one of the main voices of the Ultra party. His obsession with erasing the gains from the Revolution led to his dethronement in 1830.
</li><li> The Qin Dynasty (China, 221 BC - 206 BC) provides a pretty extreme example. Despite the name, it wasn't much of a dynasty, as the empire was founded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QinShihuangdi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QinShihuangdi">Qin Shi Huangdi</a> (in the process uniting China for the first time under a single rule), and ended three years into the reign of his son, who by all accounts was supremely incompetent. Notably, there apparently <em>was</em> a competent successor, but he was forced to commit suicide near the end of the first emperor's life. Reports vary as to whether the order was a forgery from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">advisers</a> who wanted an heir they could (theoretically) control, or a genuine article from the emperor himself, who wanted all his most competent heirs out of the way, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">under the logic</a> that, if there was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VetinariJobSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VetinariJobSecurity">nobody competent enough to replace him</a>, <em>he could not die</em>. Modern consensus is that the forgery theory is more likely; however, given that Qin Shihuang was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp">provably off his rocker</a> by the end of his life from all of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">mercury-containing "elixirs of life"</a> he was taking, the other theory isn't entirely inconsistent with the historical record.
</li><li> Emperor Commodus of the Roman Empire. Commodus was the successor and biological son of Marcus Aurelius. Marcus Aurelius was viewed as wise and versed in philosophy. While he did not make Rome a prosperous nation, he did maintain its existing success, being the final emperor of the Pax Romana period. He did this largely by preventing anti-Roman offenses, maintaining proper governance while his brother, then co-ruler, fought the Parthian Empire, and Aurelius, then sole emperor, later succesfully repelled Germanic incursions. This positive reputation has endured. Today, Aurelius is renowned as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhilosopherKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhilosopherKing">Philosopher Emperor</a> in the Stoic school of thought, and he is marked as the last of the Five Good Emperors. Commodus was not so well-liked. He was noted as being somewhat lazy and disinterested in statesmanship, partially due to him delegating many of his powers to other individuals working under him, rather than ruling unilaterally. Unlike his father, who aimed to be disciplined and humble, Commodus was vain. He viewed himself as a reincarnation of Hercules and demanded to be addressed as such. He also spent a great deal of time in arenas, acting as an active gladiator, rather than as a spectator. This was seen as unseemly and unbefitting an emperor. Late in his reign, a fire occurred in Rome (the city, not the entire empire). He took this opportunity to "refound" the city, renaming it after himself. He did the same with the months of the year, legions, and Senate. Thus, Commodus, despite being disinterested in ruling, aimed to make himself the center of the empire, with all in it named for him. Commodus's reign was followed by the Year of the Five Emperors, a period of instability, and his decided lack of interest in actually leading his empire has been posited as a cause for the decline and eventual fall of the Roman empire.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_XIV_of_Sweden">Erik XIV of Sweden<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The son of King Gustav Vasa, widely considered to be the father of modern Sweden, Erik was the oldest of Vasa's sons and seemed to be reasonably competent... that is, until he actually became king, and turned out to be mentally unstable and incapable of dealing with the pressures of being king. Among other blunders, he began a campaign of torture against percieved enemies among the nobility, and several failed war campaigns. His reign culminated in the Sture Murders, when the paranoid king ordered the massacre of the Sture nobles, descendants of the royal house that preceeded Vasa, and personally killed Nils Sture, whom he had become convinced plotted against him. After the murders, the king ran away and hid in the woods for days before he was found pretending to be a peasant in a nearby village. This was the final straw, and a year later, an uprising of nobles led by Erik's brother Johan overthrew the king, and eventually had him poisoned in jail. Johan became king, and while a relatively unremarkable ruler, he proved himself a good deal more stable.
</li><li> Emperor Tiberius was considered this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Augustus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Augustus">Augustus</a>, and another example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeterPrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeterPrinciple">The Peter Principle</a>. An extremely skilled general with little interest in politics, Tiberius came to power at an advanced age as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantRuler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantRuler">Reluctant Ruler</a> with a Senate accustomed to an imperial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality">Cult of Personality</a>. Following the death of his nephew Germanicus followed by his biological son Drusus, Tiberius retired to a private villa in Capri while letting his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo">Number Two</a>, the captain of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard">Praetorian Guard</a> Sejanus, all but rule Rome in his name. Sejanus proved very unpopular to the people of Rome and instituted a series of purges, before being implicated in a plot to replace Tiberius and being, himself, purged alongside several prominent families who had supported him. Lacking Augustus' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality">Cult of Personality</a> and personal presence in Rome, these purges (and a series of incursions into Rome's borders in Germania and Asia Minor) left Tiberius wildly unpopular. For all that, Tiberius might have been considered generally competent when looking at the pure numbers (he was emperor for twenty-five years with no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">Civil War</a> or major uprising against his rule, and left Rome's finances extremely well off with a giant surplus) had he not appointed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">The Caligula</a> as his successor.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Poland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Poland">Poland</a> routinely had this kind of problem, with great rulers being almost always succeeded with absurdly incompetent ones and not just due to high standard set up by their predecessors. Bolesław Chrobry, the very first king of the country, was followed by his son, Mieszko II, who got booted out of the throne by pagan uprising, was reduced to a duke and lost every single piece of land his father conquered. Casimir III the Great (the only Polish ruler with such nickname) died without a legal heir, so his replacement was first a titular king who never showed up in person and then a teenage girl. Władysław II Jagiełło, a highly successful king of the new dynasty, was followed by his god-awful son, Władysław III, who's biggest achievement was getting himself killed in <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Varna">the battle of Varna<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> - to the point his Polish nickname is "of Varna"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0bgek');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0bgek" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0bgek');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Extra points of irony due to Jagiełło agreeing for various privilidges for the nobility, with long-lasting consequences, just to secure this succession</span>. Next king, his younger brother, Casimir IV Jagiellon, is widely considered only second best to Casimir the Great... and was followed by <em>two</em> greatly incompetent sons, Jan and Alexander, both infamous for being utterly incapable of controlling the nobility and constantly folding under any kind of pressure. Their reign, while short-lived (9 and 5 years, respectively), was so terrible, it started the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes">Disaster Dominoes</a> leading to Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth becoming a full-blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectiveMonarchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectiveMonarchy">Elective Monarchy</a> - and the elective kings also had the fair share of sketchy successors. In fact, some of the elective kings were so bad, they've managed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">made their already awful predecessor look good by comparison</a>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seongjong_of_Joseon">King Seongjong<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> put into effect and improved the code of law created by his grandfather, appointed officials based on their abilities instead of their family or political views, and encouraged the publication of books. Unfortunately he was succeeded by his oldest son, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YeonsangunOfJoseon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YeonsangunOfJoseon">Yeonsan-gun of Joseon</a>, who became one of the worst tyrants in Korean history.
