It comes about because the writers want to introduce a new character, but don't want to come up with a complex introduction where everyone meets them and learns what they're like  it's just plain easier (and lazier) to pretend that everyone automatically knows them, and the relationship is ready-made. "Oh hey, that's my old rival!" "Oh, this is my brother/sister whom I've never told you about," etc.
</p><p>In other words, this is a relative or a friend or even a rival whom we really should have met, or at least heard about before, since the other characters would have us believe they have been crewing the same starship, working on the same project or sitting on the other side of the same classroom for years.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>This <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">can</a></em> work if the character (and the actor) proves compelling enough for the audience to suspend their disbelief, or that it's possible nobody mentioned them "on-camera" before (like if the show is set in a school, and the character is a casual acquaintance of the others but hasn't done anything significant to the plot until now). It's also possible if there's an in-story reason for the character to have been incognito (perhaps they were a spy, or an escaped convict), and the character was there in plain sight all along, but disguised as one of the show's many extras. Among the most clumsy versions is the "Long-Lost Daughter/Son". This trope can be especially disruptive if the new addition <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerTeamUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerTeamUp">doesn't fit the tone</a> of the series.
</p><p>The subverted, Watsonian version of this is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackstoryInvader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackstoryInvader">Backstory Invader</a>, when a newly-introduced character actually <em>wasn't</em> there before, but the characters are made to believe they were due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories">Fake Memories</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warping</a>, or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">Cosmic Retcon</a>.

</p><p>If the character is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHardlyKnewYe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHardlyKnewYe">going to be killed off straight away</a>, this trope can be used to turn him into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MauveShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MauveShirt">Mauve Shirt</a> beforehand.

Lampshaded when Index sees the structure for the first time and asks what it is and where it came from.

He has a flashback montage that shows the structure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">edited into</a> the background of several important past scenes. Index gets really confused, as she is sure she's seeing it for the first time.
</li><li> Orin the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighlyVisibleNinja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighlyVisibleNinja">Pink Ninja</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkazukinChacha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkazukinChacha">Akazukin Chacha</a></em> is revealed later to have been in class the whole time, but <em>clinging to the ceiling.</em>
<ul><li> The TV adaptation turned Barabaraman (one of the Urara School faculty) into an example of this, by delaying introducing him until about halfway through the series but having Chacha and co. recognize him on sight.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats">Angel Beats!</a></em>: Every acquaintance of an NPC seems to have this trope, considering <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> how Yuri had a supposed friend when she was almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed">Brainwashed</a> into becoming one</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> has a minor example with Floch. He's introduced as a member of the 104th Training Corps and fellow Survey Corps soldier before the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> battle to retake Shiganshina</span>, and is revealed to have been alongside Eren &amp; co. from the beginning. While missing from scenes up until this point, later flashbacks do show him interacting with some of the main characters during their training years. While he initially seems like yet more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">Cannon Fodder</a>, Floch <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ends up being the one to take a dying Erwin back to the main cast in Shiganshina and thus is responsible for setting off the debate about whether Erwin or Armin should be saved using the titan serum they have. After the four-year timeskip, he's shown to be a devout supporter of Eren's ideology and seems to be in charge of carrying out tasks on behalf of an imprisoned Eren</span>.
</li><li> Aoi Kuineda's primary circle of Red Tails from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beelzebub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beelzebub">Beelzebub</a></em> consisted of Nene, Yuka, Ryouko, and Chikai. Then, a random, never before mentioned purple haired member was inserted into the group, and treated as if she's been there from the very start.
</li><li> A particularly frustrating example occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em>, where in one arc Asta and Noelle meet up with a group of three mages, Fanzell, Dominante, and Mariella, in the Witches Forest Arc. Though they have never appeared in the manga before, Asta and Noelle are not only familiar with them, but have apparently already helped them escape from the Diamond kingdom, and even received trained with them. The characters were originally introduced in a light novel that serves as a side story to the manga, but it can be infuriating when the manga has flashbacks to events that never occurred in the manga. Not only that, but it's nearly impossible to tell when exactly the events of the light novel took place relative to the manga.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: Uryuu Ishida is first introduced in Chapter 34 as Ichigo's classmate and the highest-scoring student in the entire grade, yet Orihime has to explain to Ichigo who he is while Tatsuki lampshades the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> of Ichigo's careless forgetfulness. However, careful reading of earlier chapters reveals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman">Ishida in the background of several panels</a>, including Chapter 1's cover, and his father is mentioned in a throw-away line in Chapter 7, so Kubo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">deliberately invoked</a> this trope.
</li><li> Shingo Aoi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa">Captain Tsubasa</a></em> was introduced in the World Youth arc as a Tsubasa fanboy who went to say goodbye to him in the airport as he left to Brazil.
</li><li> One reason Ryo of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em> is seen as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonSue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonSue">Canon Sue</a> is this. Even if one takes into account his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">huge backstory</a> (that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">most of the viewers outside of Japan never even got to see until later</a>) that explains his presence, his sudden appearance still comes a bit out of left field even with the proper context.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> Dr. Gero is a perfect example: he was a scientist that worked for the Red Ribbon Army and created the androids for them, including the previously seen Android 8, but he was never mentioned in the Red Ribbon Army Saga. It's only when he shows up in the Android Saga years later in real life and many years later in-universe, we know all this time he was making more androids until he made ones that could defeat Goku and the others, and is also revealed that the whole time he was spying on the main characters with hidden cameras and collecting cells from them to create the bio-android Cell. It even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationInducedPlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationInducedPlotHole">creates a plot hole in the anime</a>, where Dr. Flappe was said to be the creator of Android 8 in the RR Saga, which was only addressed in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">supplemental book</a> that states they both worked on him together.
</li><li> Speaking of, the villain of the video game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallFighterZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallFighterZ">Dragon Ball Fighter Z</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodCreatedCanonForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodCreatedCanonForeigner">God-Created Canon Foreigner</a> named Android 21, who is stated to be <em>another</em> former Red Ribbon Army scientist.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestroyerDeity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestroyerDeity">God of Destruction</a> Beerus from the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBattleOfGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBattleOfGods">Battle of Gods</a></em> is a semi-example. One of the strongest beings in the entire universe (in fact, the only one stronger is his attendant Whis), no one ever mentioned him until the movie, even though King Kai, the Supreme Kais, Frieza, and Vegeta all knew about him, yet in the series they named many weaker people as "the strongest in the universe". Although this could also be explained by the fact that they were referring to the strongest "people". Beerus is a God and, just like all the Kais, is not factored into mortal power rankings.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> introduces Bulma's older sister Tights; both Goku (who's known Bulma since they were kids) and Vegeta (her husband) react to this news with "You have a sister?!" Of course, the meta reason is that Tights is from Toriyama's manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JacoTheGalacticPatrolman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JacoTheGalacticPatrolman">Jaco the Galactic Patrolman</a></em>, which was written almost 20 years after the <em>Dragon Ball</em> manga ended. Jaco himself could also count, since Bulma has known him since she was little but it apparently never came up in the intervening decades. Tights late mentioning can be justified by Bulma's tendency of not talking much about her family to her friends, just as she never mentioned her parents in the first two arcs. Tights has also distanced herself from her family for most of her life, so it's easy for them to forget her.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>, Gildarts gets this treatment in the anime. It was supposed to end before he was introduced, so the five or so mentions of his name before the Edolas arc are cut out.
<ul><li> The Tenrou Island arc introduces Mest Gryder as Mystogan's apprentice, despite not appearing alongside him or even coming to Edolas. It is then revealed that he is Doranbolt, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">a Magic Council spy who manipulated the memories of Fairy Tail to make him think he was a member for years</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It is later revealed that Mest Gryder was his real identity, as he erased his and his guildmates' memories to help with infiltrating the magic council.</span>

They cut the Youswell episode which serves as a proper introduction to Yoki, and May was also supposed to be introduced later in Youswell. To <em>Brotherhood</em>-only viewers, Yoki and May are just two random people who join Scar because they somehow know of the Elric brothers, and Yoki wants revenge for some reason. Yoki's back story and desire for revenge are explained later in the show in a series of quick flashbacks. These flashbacks occur several episodes after Yoki is introduced however, still leaving people who had never read the manga or seen the 2003 anime thoroughly confused for a while. Hilariously, when Yoki actually meets them, Ed himself doesn't remember him at first, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday">despite ruining his life.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildDiversReRise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildDiversReRise">Gundam Build Divers Re:RISE</a></em>, we're shown that Hiroto, the main character, was present in the final battle of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildDivers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildDivers">Gundam Build Divers</a></em> and that he could have altered the ending in an instant but couldn't bring himself to do so. As the Gunpla he was using, the Uraven Gundam, was a long-range sniper machine, this gives him plausibility as to why he never appeared on-screen.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Haikyuu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Haikyuu">Haikyuu!!</a></em>, Nekoma has a new starting player, Lev, in their second appearance of the manga. The explanation given is that he wasn't with them in their first appearance because he was still a newbie and they only took their main squad to training camp. In the two months between their two appearances, he developed enough to become a starter. The first OVA (which takes place between the first two seasons) properly introduces him to the anime viewers and shows how much he trained to become a starter, averting this trope.
</li><li> Padparadscha of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LandOfTheLustrous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LandOfTheLustrous">Land of the Lustrous</a></em> is suddenly introduced in episode 11—Rutile, the doctor, had been working to resolve their chronic coma for much longer than the time-span of the series. The protagonist knew about this character the whole time (saying "I'm glad I <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">didn't forget</a> about Padparadscha"), but never mentioned them before this point.

During the Young Link part of the manga, there's no place where that scene could have taken place.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar">Lucky Star</a></em>, when the cast starts their senior year, Kagami is approached by Misao and Ayano, noting that they are glad to be in Kagami's class again. Kagami then walks off, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Misao notes their position as background characters</a>, and the two then become members of the regular cast. Misao did make a brief appearance prior to this, and she even had a line... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">with a different voice actress</a> than the one she had when she started showing up regularly. Ayano also made a brief, unnamed appearance as a participant in the sports festival before becoming official. In the manga, though, the two were at first <em>unnamed</em> and were only intended to be random classmates of Kagami's class. It was later when they were actually given names and personalities.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>:

At that point, it would have been surprising if they <em>didn't</em> know new characters.

While it is also played straight, Corona remembers characters from previous seasons, even in cases when she doesn't meet them again.
</li><li> Done with Thoma, the main character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicalRecordLyricalNanohaForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicalRecordLyricalNanohaForce">Magical Record Lyrical Nanoha Force</a></em>.

It's also worth noting that outside of the Nakajima family (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Teana</a>), the other, more established main characters <em>don't</em> know Touma (at best, for instance, Nanoha knows <em>of</em> him), and they all introduce themselves properly once the circumstances allow for it.

In the next chapters it's shown that Nagisa (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassRepresentative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassRepresentative">Class Representative</a>) and Mikan (president of the news club) have known her since the start. Apparently, normal students are unaware of her existence, or that they even have a student council at all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>: Although a flashback shows that Shoto has three siblings, only one of them is shown living with him, his sister Fuyumi. Almost 200 chapters in it's shown that another of his siblings is also living with him, Natsuo, and apparently has been living with them all along. His lack of appearance is handwaved by Fuyumi saying that since he started college he has spent very little time at home and maybe also due to a secret girlfriend.
</li><li> Queen Diamond in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MysteriousJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MysteriousJoker">Mysterious Joker</a></em>. She's Silver Heart's granddaughter and grew up alongside the main protagonist and his rival, but doesn't show up or even get <em>mentioned</em> until chapter 41.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Naruto already knows the members of Team 8 and 10 and is later shown interacting with some of them in flashbacks during his time at the academy even though they do not appear to be anywhere in the classroom in Chapter 1 or 3 of the manga, even in wider shots showing the entire classroom. Likewise, Sakura first appear as Naruto's classmate in Chapter 3, but is nowhere to be found in the classroom scenes in Chapter 1. Averted in the anime, where all of aforementioned classmates make brief <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo">Early Bird Cameos</a> in the respective episodes. Possibly a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a>; Naruto had failed the Graduation Exam twice already, so he might simply have been moved to another class that had not taken the exam yet. There are at least 10 teams of three Genin so there should be at least 30 new Genin but we barely see half that number in any scene.
</li><li> Karin who first appears later in the series is shown as a participant of the Chunin Exams from earlier in the series having first met Sasuke during the Forest of Death portion of the exams, yet she did not actually appear in chapters that originally depicted the Chunin Exams.
</li><li> Another example: the presence of Danzo Shimura and his organization "Root", only introduced as of Part II/<em>Shippuuden</em>, having largely affected the behind-the-scenes politics and histories of major characters. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">Which is, in-universe, what they precisely intended to be.</a>

Not once has he ever been hinted at existing (in-universe reasoning is the Uchiha Tablet being modified), but since his introduction, he's been noted as helping Hagoromo defeat the Juubi, a feat originally seen as a solo act by Hagoromo.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Boruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Boruto">Boruto</a></em> introduces a bunch of kids (Sumire, Denki, etc) that weren't seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BorutoNarutoTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BorutoNarutoTheMovie">Boruto: Naruto the Movie</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NarutoGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NarutoGaiden">Naruto Gaiden</a></em>, or the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantEpilogue">Distant Epilogue</a>. They however are good friends with Boruto during his Academy days. The episode showing Naruto's inauguration short had new scenes added with some of them in it.
</li></ul></li><li> Sabo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>. We are made aware of the shared history of sworn brothers Luffy and Ace throughout the show. Even seeing some quick flashes of them sharing a ritual to become brothers. But when they finally show the full flashbacks of the two meeting and developing their relationship, we are suddenly introduced to a new character, their third sworn brother, Sabo. Even the previously mentioned flashback of their ritual suddenly had Sabo involved in it too. There was the <strong>very</strong> subtle hint in Ace's misspelled tattoo (ASCE, with the S crossed over), that was downright impossible to know what meant, and what we saw of the brother-making-ritual contained three cups - only with Sabo, the drinker of the third, never being shown.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Since Episode 35 ("<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/PokemonS1E35TheLegendOfDratini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/PokemonS1E35TheLegendOfDratini">The Legend of Dratini</a>") of <em>Indigo League</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedEpisode">was not aired outside of Japan and a couple other Asian countries</a>, the 30 Tauros Ash accidentally caught in that episode appear to come out of nowhere in "Showdown at the Po-ké Corral".
</li><li> During the <em>Battle Frontier</em> arc, which took place in Kanto (the setting of the first season), second- and third-generation Pokémon were portrayed as being indigenous to Kanto... even though no one seemed to know about them the first time around (barring an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo">Early-Bird Cameo</a> or two like Misty's Togepi, and even then the cameos were presented as one-of-a-kind in the region).
</li><li> Pokeathlons weren't in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">Pokémon Gold and Silver</a></em>, instead introduced in the remakes, which were released nearly ten years later. Despite this, Ash and Brock act like they had experience in the sport when Lyra mentions them in <em>Diamond and Pearl</em>.
</li><li> Serena is supposedly one of Ash's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriends">Childhood Friends</a>. Naturally, since her design is based on the default female player character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pokémon X and Y</a></em>, she first appeared in the anime arc based on these games and was never seen or mentioned prior.
</li><li> James' Victreebel evolved from Weepinbell when he left it at the breeding center in "The Breeding Center Secret" who was never mentioned before. There were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodNeverSaidThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodNeverSaidThat">rumors that in the Japanese version he stole it, but this isn't true.</a>
</li><li> Averted with Goh, as Ash slept through the summer camp where they would have met as young kids. Therefore, when they both hop on the same wild Lugia four years later they are complete strangers to each other.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyCureAllStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyCureAllStars">Pretty Cure All Stars</a></em> movies inflict this whenever extra Cures show up between the last movie and the current ones. <em>New Stage 3</em> had this as a minor gag when Grell and Enyen go to confront the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DokiDokiPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DokiDokiPrettyCure">Doki Doki Pretty Cure</a></em> team and are bewildered at the sight of Aguri and she the same. It's only when Mana walks up that the make the connection.
</li><li> Unazuki Furuhata from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>. She's Motoki's younger sister and a waitress at the Sailor Senshi's hangout, which the Furuhata family owns, and her brother has been a good friend of Usagi's from the start, but there's nothing to even hint at Unazuki's existence until she appears suddenly in the second season.
</li><li> Ai Kaga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei">Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei</a></em> first appears in the <em>last</em> episode of the first series. She explains that she hid away from the camera, believing that if she appeared it would drive down the ratings.
</li><li> Just as their western brethren, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> anime can be guilty of this as well. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada">Transformers Armada</a></em> offers a baffling example, where the humongous Autobot Overload makes his grand intro by randomly rolling up in the middle of an episode to act as Optimus Prime's trailer. It's never explained where this guy came from, which is made even weirder by the fact that he's supposedly a small Mini-Con robot called Rollout who wears "Overload" as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a>. Despite that gathering these Mini-Cons was the main <em>point</em> of the series' first half, with <em>many</em> episodes being dedicated to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchThemAll">finding one or two "regular" Mini-Cons</a>, here we have one that comes with his own set of gigantic armor and can look the regular robot cast in the eye, yet he's the one not to get an intro episode.
</li><li> Because of its episodic nature, this tends to happen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Uzumaki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Uzumaki">Uzumaki</a></em>. One notable example is when a chapter near the middle of the manga introduces Kirie's pregnant cousin, Keiko. Even though Kirie's clearly close with Keiko, this is the first time we ever hear of her.
</li><li> In the fourth season <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em>, Yusuke Fujiwara uses the "false memory" variant on almost everyone, but it's played straight when Fubuki remembers him. Fujiwara was his classmate and he was connected with the old Obelisk Dorm and Fubuki's disappearance prior to season 1.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em> featured Kyosuke Kiryu and Crow Hogan, who were apparently always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">best friends with the main characters</a> despite not appearing in any of the flashbacks with Yusei and Jack in the past. Crow is particularly bizarre, since in prior episodes, Yusei was established as hopelessly scrounging for parts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">in Satellite</a> to build a D-Wheel that even works, but Crow, also a Satellite resident in even worse economic straits, is introduced with a high-spec D-Wheel in perfect condition that can <em>fly.</em>
<ul><li> Crow's high-quality D-Wheel is later justified, since he inherited it from his late friend Robert Pearson, who was a luminary in building D-Wheels and he was even offered a job in Neo-Domino City.
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied with Rise in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuruYuri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuruYuri">Yuru-Yuri</a></em>. She's supposedly been the head of the student council from day one, even though none of the four lead girls have ever seen her. To drive this home, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashBack">Flash Back</a> shows that she was present at the group's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeachEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeachEpisode">trip to the beach</a>, but stood just out of view of the camera.

<ul><li> Dulcy the Dragon was fitted in with nothing more then a small back-up story introduction which gave her backstory and essentially went "She's been part of the Freedom Fighters all this time! Honest!" Post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">Super Genesis Wave</a>, Dulcy has been reintroduced to the (extended) cast. As this was in a story arc that added several characters, and showed flashbacks to her introduction (in the past of the new universe) it was less jarring than the first time.
</li><li> Lampshaded example when Dr. Eggman meets a leader of one of his armies known as Axel the Water Buffalo. He's quick to say he recognizes him and recruits him in trying to get to the Death Egg II. Orbot's quick to point out that they've never seen him before and Eggman has already figured that out - he admits that he was too hasty in stopping Super Sonic's Chaos Control, and realizes that a lot of the universe has been altered..

Because the series is written as if there is a longstanding continuity (which there isn't), most people are introduced in one issue and will have their origins explained many issues later, if at all.

She has a strained relationship with Scott both because of his past as a criminal and his career as a superhero, feeling it's too dangerous for their daughter. This despite the fact that in Scott's first appearances his wife, and Cassie's mother, never appeared or was mentioned, with it being implied that Scott was raising Cassie alone.

That was it for decades, until a second daughter, Tam, was suddenly introduced out of nowhere in 2002, with Bruce already knowing her and the two apparently having a friendly relationship. Then, following <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Flashpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Flashpoint">Flashpoint</a></em>, a <em>FOURTH</em> Fox child, Luke, was introduced as the second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batwing">Batwing</a>.

He was apparently a childhood friend of Bruce's, and Bruce holds him in incredibly high regard, and it's heavily implied that Thomas partly inspired Bruce's methods as Batman...

<ul><li> Golden Girl and the Human Top. Both of them were created in the 70's to add a little diversity (Golden Girl being Japanese-American and Human Top being black) to Marvel's Golden Age, and were retroactively stated to have fought alongside Captain America and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuckyBarnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuckyBarnes">Bucky</a> as members of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInvaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInvaders">The Invaders</a>.

Not only was the sister never mentioned prior to this, she was pretty much never mentioned again <em>after</em> the series ended either! The sister was eventually mentioned again years later in the <em>Iron Patriot</em> limited series...so that it could be established that she had a daughter, Lila Rhodes, who is apparently very close with James despite having never been seen or mentioned before. The series also added a previously-unmentioned son of the above-mentioned Isaiah Bradley - Josiah al hajj Saddiq - who'd apparently been around since the sixties and had become a superhero.

</li><li> This trope was the favorite approach of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks">Carl Barks</a> when introducing new characters in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse">Disney Ducks Comic Universe</a>, and several of his successors take similar approaches. Characters like Uncle Scrooge, Gladstone Gander, Gyro Gearloose and even the Beagle Boys were all introduced in stories that treated them as if they'd always been there, just not on-page (though Scrooge admittedly is introduced as a solitary miser who hardly ever gets in touch). In this case it works, largely because the Duck comics tend to be standalone stories that operate on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity">Negative Continuity</a>.
<ul><li> This approach is also used by Italian authors: Brigitta McBridge is stated in her debut story to have known Scrooge since at least 1898 (back when Scrooge had moved to Whitehorse and became a businessman), with a later story showing their first encounter actually dates to when Scrooge was a prospector and had just struck rich; Jubal Pomp debuts as a recurring annoyance of Scrooge, and a later story actually puts their first meeting at the same time as the one between Scrooge and Brigitta; and Gideon McDuck was presented as Scrooge's younger <em>brother</em> (this was many years before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLifeAndTimesOfScroogeMcDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLifeAndTimesOfScroogeMcDuck">The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck</a></em> was published. Nowadays Gideon appears from time to time, but his relation to Scrooge is left out).

The excuse for why we'd never heard of him was that Vic had been hit by a car after an argument with Stephen, with his body placed in cryogenic stasis until medical science could advance far enough to save his life. That explains why Vic had never been <em>seen</em> before, but not why Strange had never <em>mentioned</em> him prior to this.

</li><li> In DC's second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HawkAndDove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HawkAndDove">Hawk and Dove</a></em> series, Dawn Granger (the second Dove) was stated to be an only child. Flash forward to 2005: After Dawn was retconned to have actually been alive after her supposed death in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Armageddon2001" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Armageddon2001">Armageddon 2001</a></em> (a long story), she showed up in the pages of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> with a bratty younger sister named Holly Granger, who was apparently away living in England all this time. What made it stranger is that they tried to rectify this by explaining Dawn's parents were divorced to provide a <em>Parent Trap</em>-like story, when in the <em>Hawk and Dove</em> series they were shown to be happily married with no issues in their relationship. To make things even MORE confusing: Holly's personality, appearance, speech patterns (does she speak British slang or not?), and her age wound up being cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist">Depending on the Artist</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's no wonder they eventually killed her off.

He was created to fix the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole">Plot Holes</a> that sprung up from having Hawkeye learn archery from the Swordsman, who had never demonstrated any proficiency with a bow.

She later gained powers of her own and was mind-controlled into picking a fight with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a>, leading directly to a severe beating and coma. She recovered with the help of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JeanGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JeanGrey">Jean Grey</a>. All of the preceding "happened" before she even debuted in comics. What's more, her origin involved witnessing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a>'s origin; she's been inserted into the fiction <em>that far back</em>. One <em>Spider-Man</em> comic goes to the point of using a panel from the '60s <em>Amazing Spider-Man</em> comic and pointing that she was one of the background characters featured in the panel.

<ul><li> Early in his career, Spidey fought a trio of criminal mercenaries called the Enforcers rather often, Fancy Dan, Montana, and the original Ox, the last little more than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">Dumb Muscle</a> thug named Raymond Bloch. Eventually, Ox left the other two to join Mr. Fear's Fellowship of Fear, where he was killed — or so it seemed — from a fall during a battle with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a>. It turned out, however, that Raymond had a twin brother named Ronald who was <em>also</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">Dumb Muscle</a> thug, but whom Raymond had never mentioned. Nonetheless, Ronald joined up with the other two members of the Enforcers to take his brother's place. (And stayed with them when Raymond turned up alive years later, working for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKingpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKingpin">The Kingpin</a>.)
</li><li> The limited series <em>The Thousand</em> introduced another of Peter Parker's classmates who was there during the spider-bite incident. Unfortunately this was a super-smart sadistic bully, noted for making young Parker eat dog vomit. The nutbar figured things out and <em>ate</em> the now dead power-granting spider, becoming a body-hopping crazed killer. It got worse from there.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OriginalSin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OriginalSin">Original Sin</a></em> introduced us to Cindy Moon, who would go on to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Silk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Silk">Silk</a>. She was introduced as another person who was there at the experiment that gave Peter his powers and was even bitten <em>by</em> the same spider before it died. She was picked up by Ezekiel Sims in an attempt to protect her from Morlun and never bothered to tell anyone connected to him.

</li><li> Subverted with Clayton Cole, a 2014-debuting teenager who was also "introduced" as having been around during Peter's high school/early Spider-Man days. This mechanically gifted but otherwise chronically shy and introverted, home-schooled teen was one of Spidey's first and "biggest"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1crst');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1crst" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1crst');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">from Clayton's perspective, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday">not so much Spidey's</a></span> fans from his wrestling days, and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunnerTechMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunnerTechMarchesOn">helped</a> (in his mind) spread the transitioning Superhero's popularity. Deciding he wants to be a hero, too (in part to be close to his idol, but also for fame soaking-up purposes), he creates his own costumed identity, complete with homemade sound-based powers, dubbing himself "Clash". Alas, his first meeting in-costume with Spidey didn't go so well, ending with Spidey declaring/treating the bumbling newbie as just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain">another villain</a>. The popularity his Clash persona ends up receiving going straight to his head coupled with Spidey spurning him causes Clayton to snap, culminating into the final "confrontation" at school, with Spidey unmasking the newly-dubbed "Creepy Clayton". This Trope is subverted in Clayton's case because, despite the trappings, no one <em>actually remembers</em> Clayton; for Peter, he was nothing more than an early career blip that largely resolved itself. Clayton also has more of a happier ending later in his life then many similar others, and despite his and Spidey's history, doesn't really become more than a minor supporting character in Peter's life.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note09er6');"><sup>Details </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note09er6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note09er6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">After the unmasking, Clayton ends up in juvie. He's on parole 13 years later, and due to his circumstances, has to hire himself out as a masked scientist goon to get any work. Having largely matured and mellowed out since his short-lived, yet life-defining Clash days, he turns on his employer and helps Spider-Man foil her plans. In turn, Spider-Man, who's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">matured vastly</a> from his teenage years, directs the now-bearded Clayton (whom he does eventually recognize) toward Parker Industries, where an equally-matured Peter welcomes him with open arms. Thus, Clayton is now a loyal, if somewhat minor (compared to a few of his fellow employees), scientist working for Parker Industries, albeit while still on parole (so he cannot be seen in any costume, even if he helps Peter/Spidey out in a crisis situation, a la the Ghost sabotage).</span>
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkWaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkWaid">Mark Waid</a> and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesRobinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesRobinson">James Robinson</a>'s <em>Amazing Spider-Man: Family Business</em>, it is revealed that Spider-Man <em>supposedly</em> has a long-lost younger sister named Teresa. <em>Supposedly</em>, because it is unclear whether or not Teresa is really his sister since Mentallo was responsible for putting a perception filter effect on her.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChipZdarsky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChipZdarsky">Chip Zdarsky</a>'s <em>Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man</em> introduces Hophni Mason, the heroic brother of the Tinkerer. He's been repairing superhero tech for years, and counts characters like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan">Ant-Man</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFalcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFalcon">The Falcon</a> and even Iron Man among his clientele. Peter is completely surprised to learn of Hophni's existence, and wonders why his fellow heroes never told him about the guy.
<ul><li> This is a subversion. It is revealed Hophni Mason is the Tinkerer in disguise. Hophni Mason is a robotic suit the Tinkerer controlled from the inside and used to get information on superheroes. It was an older character masquerading as a never before seen character that previously existed.
</li></ul></li><li> The Janice Lincoln version of the Beetle is an interesting example. She was around as a minor villain for a little while, but wasn't revealed to be the daughter of Tombstone (a fairly prominent Spider-Man villain) until she started appearing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSuperiorFoesOfSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSuperiorFoesOfSpiderMan">The Superior Foes of Spider-Man</a></em>. The fact that we'd never seen her before was subtly lampshaded, as it turns out that her dad purposefully steered her away from the world of costumed supervillainy so that she could make even <em>more</em> money as an attorney.
</li><li> The <em>Shuri</em> solo series introduces a kid named Augustine Torres, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy">Child Prodigy</a> who attended the same school as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MilesMorales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MilesMorales">Miles Morales</a> and is supposedly one of his close friends.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em>:
<ul><li> Originally in Marvel's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers">Transformers</a></em> comic, Sparkplug Witwicky's teenage son was named Buster, and he was clearly supposed to be the same character as Spike Witwicky on the TV series. Four years later, Hasbro released the toy Fortress Maximus, who came with a figure named Spike Witwicky. So, in the comics, Buster was suddenly revealed to have an older brother named Spike who had been away from home all this time.
</li><li> The Marvel comic also did a lot of this with introducing new characters whenever their toys came out. The Decepticon Pretenders are particularly obvious, because the six of them are claimed to have been there all along among Scorponok's crew.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersAllHailMegatron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersAllHailMegatron">The Transformers: All Hail Megatron</a></em>, because Scourge (who makes his IDW debut here) is part of the neutral dead universe faction of Transformers, despite all of them being established in a past miniseries, Scourge just shows up among the casualties, and the narration hints he was there all along.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersCombinerWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersCombinerWars">The Transformers: Combiner Wars</a></em>: Due to the new combiner toys getting shilled out, Blackjack and Off Road show up amongst the Stunticons just in time for their inevitable combination. While Off Road is addressed as being the new guy on the team, Blackjack's treated like he's been there all along, which is odd considering in issue 2 Blackjack was a member of the Secret Police assigned to the Stunticons.
</li><li> Toni Ho from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewAvengers2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewAvengers2015">New Avengers (2015)</a></em> is the daughter of Ho Yinsen, a prominent character from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a>'s origin. The fact that she'd never been mentioned or seen before (despite Yinsen's son having appeared in the past) was explained as her parents having divorced when she was a kid, meaning she grew up in America while her dad stayed in Asia.
</li><li> Angela Del Toro and Ava Ayala, the two most recent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhiteTiger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhiteTiger">White Tigers</a>, were introduced this way. When Angela was introduced, it was said she grew up viewing Luke Cage and Danny Rand as honorary uncles, but they never mentioned her before and her introduction also necessitated retconning her mother Awilda's death (she had been killed with her parents by Gideon Mace). They would later use that same retcon with Ava's introduction, showing that her older sister Awilda raised her, and that she only escaped the massacre of her family because she was at school when it happened.
</li><li> In general, this is the case for many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant">Canon Immigrant</a> characters. For instance, when Melinda May made the jump from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a></em> to the comics, she was introduced as a legendary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SHIELD">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> operative that had apparently been around for years, despite never having been seen or mentioned in any prior comics. This specific case is slightly justified though, since S.H.I.E.L.D. is a massive organization that employs tens of thousands of agents across the globe. It makes sense that we've only ever met a small fraction of them in the actual books.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackPanther">Black Panther</a>:
<ul><li> Princess <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shuri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shuri">Shuri</a>, T'Challa's little sister, was introduced as a young woman in a 2005 issue of the series, with everyone acting like she's always been there. The same writer also gave T'Challa an unnamed younger brother who was killed by Klaw, though unlike Shuri, he's almost never remembered or mentioned.
</li><li> The Dora Milaje didn't exist until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherPriestComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherPriestComics">Christopher Priest</a>'s run, but are nonetheless treated as an indispensable part of the mythos at this point. Same goes for Hunter, T'Challa's adopted older brother.
</li><li> Ramonda, the Queen Mother of Wakanda, didn't exist until 1989. However, unlike many other examples of this trope, there's a good reason why she wasn't seen or talked about beforehand. She had been kidnapped and imprisoned shortly after T'Chaka's death, causing everyone to assume she'd left the country to be with a new man.
</li></ul></li><li> The Black Order were introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Infinity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Infinity">Infinity</a></em> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thanos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thanos">Thanos</a>' elite generals, with the implication that they'd been around for quite some time. At one point, Supergiant even mentions that Thanos recruited her from an orphanage back when she was a child. The team had never appeared or been mentioned in any of the decades worth of previous stories featuring Thanos, and in fact, Thanos had traditionally been depicted as relying on others as little as possible when he could help it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> does this over and over and over again. Siblings like Sunfire's sister Sunpyre and Xavier's twin Cassandra Nova were always there. The "original" new team of all-new-all-different X-Men consisted of Vulcan, Petra, Sway and Darwin, who mostly died (two of them got better). Sage has always been Xavier's personal spy since she was the first mutant he met, but never did anything (nothing mutantly, anyway, she was an established if extreeeemely minor character for decades) during the regular stories. Elias Bogan has always been a long-lived influential figure of the Hellfire Club.
<ul><li> Cassandra Nova at least justified it - she was deliberately hiding her presence, and since she has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> stronger than Charles' it's not inconceivable that she could.
</li><li> The situation with Sunpyre was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a>. Immediately after meeting her, Jean Grey confusedly stated that she'd known Sunfire for years and he'd never mentioned having a little sister.
</li><li> Sage was present in the comics for years, and her mutant and spy status is arguably a case of either this trope or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a>: in fact, it was teased at off-and-on during several of Claremont's plot threads. The origin story of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewMutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewMutants">New Mutants</a>, for example, has her randomly help the New Mutants against Pierce and the Hellfire Club (her employers). Xavier does <em>declare</em> not to trust her, but we're never told if it's just to cover up her status as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>, or if he's afraid of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask">Becoming the Mask</a> scenario. Anyway, that was <strong>20 years before</strong> Sage's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">reveal</a> as Xavier's spy.
</li></ul></li><li> The Blue Marvel was introduced as a black <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">Silver Age</a> superhero <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">who was forced to retire due to the institutional racism of the 60s</a>. He ended up coming out of his exile during the 21st century to help <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a> battle his old nemesis.
</li><li> Parodied (?) with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a> as there have been a number of comics and mini-series that place him in various eras of the Marvel Universe that predate his creation— teaming up with Iron Fist and Luke Cage during their "Heroes for Hire" era, taking over for Iron Man during the "Demon in a Bottle" era, even showing up in the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWars1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWars1984">Secret Wars</a> and bonding with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Venom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Venom">Venom</a> symbiote. However, it's quite hard to tell which of these stories (if any) have actually happened and which ones are simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf">What Ifs</a> created in the spirit of fun (particularly when you remember that it's already been established that 1) Deadpool's mental instability has been known to mess with his memory and 2) he's aware that he's a comic book character, thus subject to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast">Multiple-Choice Past</a>).
</li><li> Similarly, Sally Floyd was created for the mini series <em>Generation M</em>, after the events of <em>House of M</em>, with the reader being informed that she had multiple interviews with famous mutants and dated Angel. She was apparently a friend and confidante of X-Men such as Jubilee, Beak and Dani Moonstar, but was simply never seen or mentioned until now.
</li><li> Union Jack was another Marvel character from the Silver Age that was retconned into the Golden Age. In fact, an actual Golden Age Marvel hero (the Destroyer) was retconned into being the first Union Jack but in a disguise.
</li><li> DC Comics had several heroes that were created in the 70s and 80s, but were established as having been active during the 40s. Among them were Amazing-Man (chronologically, one of the earliest black superheroes) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Steel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Steel">Commander Steel</a>, both of whom were established as having fought alongside the members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica">JSA</a> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AllStarSquadron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AllStarSquadron">All-Star Squadron</a>.
</li><li> This happens to Barbara Gordon so much that's it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>.
<ul><li> Katarina Armstrong, the second Spy Smasher introduced late into the first volume of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BirdsOfPrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BirdsOfPrey">Birds of Prey</a></em>, was a college roommate and rival of Barbara's. She had never been referred to before that.
</li><li> Munira Khairuddin, AKA Obscura, debuted more than halfway through Barbara's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2011">New 52 series</a> and was <em>also</em> established as a former college classmate and rival, despite never having been mentioned prior.
</li><li> Frankie Charles, who made her first appearance in the Burnside era of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2011">Batgirl (2011)</a></em>, had been an acquaintance Babs knew from her time in physiotherapy.
</li><li> In the first issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatgirlRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatgirlRebirth">Batgirl (Rebirth)</a></em>, Barbara happens to run into a man named Kai, a childhood friend of hers who, once again, had not been seen or referred to prior.
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of <em>Rebirth</em>, there's an odd variant of this trope with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batwoman">Batwoman</a>. The character has been around since 2006, but didn't have any real ties to Batman, even after it was revealed in a later story that they were cousins. Suddenly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DetectiveComicsRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DetectiveComicsRebirth">Detective Comics (Rebirth)</a></em> establishes that Kate and Bruce were quite close when they were children, and that Kate even comforted Bruce at his parents' funeral.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCRebirth">Rebirth</a></em> also establishes that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a> Wally West is <em>not</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift">Race Lifted</a> version of the original Wally West. The original Wally immediately recognizes Wally II and states that the boy is his cousin, implying that he (and by extension, his father, Daniel West) existed in the previous continuity as well. At no point in any of the decades worth of prior <em>Flash</em> stories did Wally ever mention having a cousin who was also named Wally. However, this is actually addressed when Eobard Thawne regains all of his true memories of the pre-Flashpoint universe and states that Wally II is "New." Later issues confirmed that Wally II did not exist at all in the pre-Flashpoint universe, and was explicitly created thanks to the revisions done by Dr. Manhattan.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1942" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1942">Volume 1</a></em>: Suddendly Diana has a beloved adopted little sister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ContinuitySnarl/DonnaTroy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ContinuitySnarl/DonnaTroy">Donna</a> that she rescued from a fire years ago and brought home to Paraidise Island, who has had enough time acting as a teen superhero to be a intigral part of the founding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a> team. This retcon helped smooth out the wrinkles in having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl">Wonder Girl</a> around after the "impossible tales" with Diana as Wonder Woman had already been retgonned.

This was universally forgiven though since the sweetheart vegetarian master chef minotaur was a beloved addition to her supporting cast.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em> has done this a number of times:
<ul><li> The original series introduced The Pride, a criminal organization-slash-cult that has ruled Los Angeles since the 1980's, and yet which had never been mentioned anywhere else in the Marvel Universe.
</li><li> Whedon's brief run on the series introduced the Upward Path and the Sinners, two rival gangs of superhumans who fought for control of New York City in the 1900's and had ties to the Pride. Needless to say, there's never been any mention of them anywhere else.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion">Secret Invasion</a></em> introduced Chrell and X'iv, Xavin's former mentor and classmate, respectively.
</li><li> The final arc of the third series introduced Hunter Stein, Chase's never-before-mentioned uncle.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daken">Daken</a></em> retconned Marcus Roston, Daken's evil ex-boyfriend, as being a supposed former member of The Pride who got kicked out for creeping on Chase.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RainbowRowellsRunaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RainbowRowellsRunaways">Rainbow Rowell's Runaways</a></em> takes the cake on retconned friends and relatives. To start with, there is Dr. Hayes, Molly's long-lost grandmother, whose lack of prior mention is lampshaded as her being estranged from Molly's parents. Later there are The Seed, the children of the Gibborim who were never even hinted to exist prior to the series. There's also The One, the spirit inhabiting Nico's Staff of One who comes out of nowhere. And finally, there is Doc Justice, a superhero who has supposedly been around for nearly as long as The Pride, but who has never been mentioned anywhere.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InvaderZimOni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InvaderZimOni">Invader Zim (Oni)</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> with a deceased Irken named Thoob in Issue 46. Apparently, despite him never existing in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">series proper</a> or <em>not even appearing until that issue</em>, Zim liked him enough to devote a shrine to his memory and outright mourn him, in contrast to not remembering established characters Skoodge and Tak when GIR mentions them.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns">Batman Returns</a></em> (1992), Max Shreck has apparently been one of Gotham City's most famous residents for quite some time ("Here's a man who needs no introduction, he's given so much"), having been around long enough to have established the town's most successful department store, become more wealthy than anyone except Bruce Wayne himself, gotten a mayoral candidate elected, <em>and</em> gained enough influence to propose the construction of a new electrical power plant. So it's strange in retrospect that he apparently didn't exist at the time of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989">the 1989 film</a>, particularly since Gotham's 200th anniversary festival budget was seriously short on funds and he would probably have been the most philanthropic contributor. Shreck's Department Store is arguably an even more blatant New Guy: if we are to assume that the cathedral entrance on the opposite side of the city square, which we see behind the Penguin as he escapes on his helicopter umbrella, is to the same cathedral in which the Joker hid out at the climax of the previous film (and, at least according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">Fanon</a>, it is), the store is so big and so gaudy that it wouldn't previously have been missed. Of course, it's possible that, in-universe, <em>Batman Returns</em> is taking place many years after the original film; however, as all the returning cast members look to be about the same age as before (which they are, of course), that isn't likely.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2yh74');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2yh74" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2yh74');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> This is because Max Shreck's role in the film was originally filled by Harvey Dent, returning from the 1989 film, who was supposed to be given the disfigurement that turns him into Two-Face by Catwoman at the end of the film. Of course, all this was changed.</span>
</li><li> A few characters who were in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Divergent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Divergent">Divergent</a></em> but got left out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Divergent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Divergent">the film adaptation</a> - such as Uriah and Marlene, appear in <em>The Divergent Series: Insurgent</em> along with the rest of the Dauntless.

The in-universe justification is twofold: she's kept her distance from the Crawleys and being a woman, she has no claim on Downton anyways (the main story revolved around the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a> surrounding Downton) and thus little relevance to the plot.

<ul><li> Pierce's situation seems especially odd that in that it appears he's Fury's <em>superior</em> (or at least the politically-appointed head of SHIELD while Fury is the operational leader), whereas <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a></em> implies that Fury reported directly to the Council. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a></em> further confuses the issue because a flashback established Pierce had been in a high-ranking position years earlier. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame">Avengers: Endgame</a></em> retconned him into having a role in the events of <em>The Avengers</em>, showing that he was involved in the retrieval of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Loki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Loki">Loki</a>'s cosmic scepter (which contained the Mind Stone) following the Battle of New York.

Early versions of the script were going to explain that he was in fact Goldar's cousin visiting for the summer, but the final movie leaves this out, and so there's just a brand new pig alien accompanying Zedd, Rita, and Goldar as they release Ivan Ooze that they're all already familiar with.

The fact that they weren't in the previous film(s) is justifiable, as they hadn't been created yet. What <em>isn't</em> justifiable is that <em>the movie never actually introduces them</em>  we just meet them being up to some hijinx as though who they were had already been established.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>: To some extent, this is par for the course in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TrekVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TrekVerse">the Star Trek universe</a>, especially with the original series.

<ul><li> Khan meets Chekov and says he knows him because "I never forget a face." Which means that Chekov was on ship during "Space Seed," a first-season episode, despite the character not appearing on screen until the second season. Numerous explanations have been thrown about (he was on the ship, just not as bridge crew; Chekov was the officer in charge of delivering the supplies and food to Ceti Alpha V; an obvious joke about Chekov occupying a latrine Khan wanted to use), but ultimately it comes down to this trope.
</li><li> Another example from <em>Wrath of Khan</em> is Doctor Carol Marcus, Kirk's old flame. They even had a son together. McCoy's aware of her too (presumably from back in the day). And yet we're only hearing about her now, after all these years. Justified, however, in that Kirk slept with a <em>ton</em> of women. (And assuming David is the same age as his actor, Merritt Butrick, he would have been born, and Kirk and Carol's relationship would have been, several years before the original series, and Kirk explicitly states he "stayed away," as Carol wanted, after David was born.)
</li><li> Some have speculated that Carol Marcus was the "blonde lab technician" that Gary Mitchell set Kirk up with, mentioned in the second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">TOS</a> pilot "Where No Man Has Gone Before".

The first drafts of the script <em>did</em> have Saavik in that part, but the writers ultimately decided that having Saavik <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">betray the crew of the <em>Enterprise</em> and frame them for the assassination of Gorkon</span> just didn't make sense for her character. (This is something that's been disputed by Nicholas Meyer. While he wanted it to be Saavik, but Roddenberry leaned on him a bit because he didn't believe it'd fit the character. Meyer may still disagree, seeing as how he came up with Saavik to begin with.)

In fairness, the original series made it plain that Kirk had plenty of old girlfriends, and he made quite a few new ones along the way (this is <em>Kirk</em>, after all). The real surprise is that David Marcus was his ONLY child. (Explained in the novelization of the movie; what Kirk actually did was experience similar fantasies with all of the women he'd truly been in love with.). They try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> this, saying that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement">Kirk retired from Starfleet</a> at some point between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture">Star Trek: The Motion Picture</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</a></em>, and returned to Starfleet once they broke up.

Could be justified by the fact he <em>was</em> a Borg for a while, but that doesn't explain why he doesn't mention this vital piece of information about a dangerous enemy onscreen, and Data seemingly knows nothing about her despite the fact that he presumably would have read any report Picard made after the incident. They attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwave</a> this by implying that Picard had forgotten about her until they're reintroduced in the film.

She's introduced as the Executive Officer of the <em>Excalibur</em> and a former lover of Calhoun's, with her earlier on-scene absence described as being due to her taking the night shift.

</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars Legends</a></em>:
<ul><li> It plays with this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheForce">Legacy of the Force</a></em> with Brisha Syo. We know she's Lumiya. We really do. Despite this, Mara assumes she's Luke and Lumiya's daughter. Since Mara and Luke have each other's memories from their Force bond, Lumiya barely kissed Luke, and that TIE crash would most likely have led to a miscarriage, why Mara would even think that only raises even more questions. That said, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that even if they use a character from the comics, they are free to accept or reject anything that took place in them.
</li><li> By contrast, it's played straight and lampshaded in <em>Invincible</em>. Tenel Ka has cousins? Okay, so Ta'a Chume secretly had more than one son, we'll give her the benefit of the doubt and accept that she managed to hide her pregnancy. And... Tenel Ka has cousins? But the fact that nobody knows about them is what makes them so useful. And, wait, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">Tenel Ka has cousins?</a>
</li><li> It's likely that Kevin J.

At the time of the Legends continuity reboot in 2014, at least one was never positively identified.
</li><li> Winter, Princess Leia's best friend and hero of the Rebellion, is introduced this way in <em>Heir To The Empire</em>. Having a character who we should have seen during the original trilogy, but didn't, lead many readers to mistrust her and think that she was Delta Source (back when it was assumed that Delta Source was a spy in the imperial palace, and not just a left-over surveillance network that the New Republic never found.)
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> series, we hear briefly about the Volturi, mainly that they and Carlisle are on friendly terms, but that he left because he did not agree with their diet of humans. Edward speaks pretty well of them, when he tells Bella about them. In the next book and all books after, it's revealed that the Volturi are a highly corrupt organization, and the Cullens are all highly suspicious of them. This also leads to a case of Remember Those New Rules, since it's not until then that it's mentioned that there are any sort of laws or governing of vampires.
<ul><li> In <em>New Moon</em>, we find out that the teenagers of La Push had been turning into werewolves ever since the Cullens first settled down in Forks. This is not present in <em>Twilight</em> (when nothing is done to stop James, Victoria, and Laurent from killing people in Forks) or <em>Midnight Sun</em> (when nothing is done to stop Peter and Charlotte from killing people in Forks).
<ul><li> The James, Victoria, and Laurent example is only in the film version. In the book, they never kill any of the residents of Forks.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em> book <em>Moonrise</em>, six cats were sent to deal with the mountain lion, Sharptooth. The Clan cats meet three of them: Talon, Bird, and Rock, who explain that the other three had been killed by Sharptooth. In the next book, the Clans return to the Tribe, and there's a fourth cat, Jag, listed as being one of the ones originally sent to fight Sharptooth, with no explanation as to why we didn't see him in the last book (though the characters do recognize him and say they'd met him before).

</li><li> Most secondary characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Frivolesque" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Frivolesque">Frivolesque</a></em> are introduced in this fashion, most notably Delphine, Marie-Neige roommate, who is mentioned for the first time in chapter 4 but has been supposedly living with her for years.
</li><li> The first chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Gaia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Gaia">Gaia</a></em> spends most of its time setting up the five main student character, Ilias, Lilith, Alissa, Ryn, and Sandril, before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Red Hall attack</span> kicks off the main plot. At the start of the second, Ilias gets a missive from the other four, and asks his mother about a "Zoltan," who decided to move, and "Aaret," <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killed in the attack</span>. There was no mention of either in the first chapter, in which the main five seem a fairly tight-knit clique, nor are there any obvious candidates among the miscellaneous students.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GorgeousPrincessCreamyBeamy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GorgeousPrincessCreamyBeamy">Gorgeous Princess Creamy Beamy</a></em> was well into its second story arc when the character of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Cheesecake Saint Cherrywell</a> was introduced. Played for laugh, since she explained <a class="urllink" href="http://creamybeamy.comicgenesis.com/d/20060807.html">being disguised as someone else and having the flu during her earlier appearances<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which is why we've never seen her at all before.
</li><li> A particularly poignant example can be found in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LeastICouldDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LeastICouldDo">Least I Could Do</a></em>, when a guy named Noel knocks on Rayne's door. Noel, as the audience is told, is actually Rayne's best bud and wingman from years back, despite never being mentioned prior in the comic's run. Rayne initially acts grumpy about the sudden reappearance, but it doesn't take long at all for Noel to replace John as the number-two character in the strip.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyArcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyArcade">Penny Arcade</a></em> with Jim, who was apparently part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio">Power Trio</a> with Gabe and Tycho (complete with being The Kirk to Gabe and Tycho's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMccoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMccoy">McCoy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpock">Spock</a>). Unfortunately they never really mentioned him before (or since!) and by the point he's first mentioned, he'd <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong">been dead for six years</a>.
<ul><li> He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">tried to get revenge</a> for being forgotten in his next appearance... five years later.
</li></ul></li><li> Dale in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/QuestionableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/QuestionableContent">Questionable Content</a></em> was established as a regular at Coffee of Doom in his first appearance. This one feels much more natural than other examples of the trope can be, though, as the fact that actual <em>customers</em> are rarely shown in scenes set at Coffee of Doom despite the business being fairly successful had previously been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> and most of his subsequent appearances involve interactions with a character who explicitly <em>didn't</em> know the main cast beforehand.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SchlockMercenary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SchlockMercenary">Schlock Mercenary</a></em>. The Toughs are a mercenary company anywhere between several dozen and a few hundred strong, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">not all of them identified</a>. Introducing a new character <a class="urllink" href="http://www.schlockmercenary.com/2006-03-02">can and has been as simple as giving one of them a name and a job that lets the audience know what he does.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Joan from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/NamirDeiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/NamirDeiter">Namir Deiter</a></em> was introduced as already being friends with main character Tipper and her best friend Gabby. Within ten strips, she was Gabby's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItsYouItsOkay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItsYouItsOkay">live-in lover</a> and the newest cast regular.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/CosmicDash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/CosmicDash">Cosmic Dash</a></em>: Chapter 4 marks the first appearance of a crew of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates">Space Pirates</a> with a long-standing grudge on the Lucky Strike Transport Company. Played with in that the main characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival">practically forget they exist when not confronted by them</a>.

</li><li> Princess Amira was introduced in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Neopets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Neopets">Neopets</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.neopets.com/desert/ldp/index.phtml">Lost Desert Plot<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> as being the eldest daughter of the late King Coltzan III, who inherited the throne of Sakhmet after his murder.

Amira's sudden appearance was explained by her having been away on official business before.
</li><li> The writer of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Noob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Noob">Noob</a></em> is trying to have the different media both complementary and potentially independent from each other. One of the consequences is that a medium sometimes has a character formally introduced in another just appear with everyone already knowing them.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/UltraFastPony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/UltraFastPony">Ultra Fast Pony</a></em>. After the girls get invited to Twilight's brother's wedding, Applejack actually interrupts the theme song to complain about how he's never been mentioned before.
<div class="indent"><strong>Rarity:</strong> Twilight, you can't just randomly decide that you've <em>always</em> had a brother! <br/><strong>Twilight:</strong> What?! I <em>have</em> always had a brother, I just haven't talked about him until now.

When Mike and Jay express confusion, scenes from past reviews are played with the character spliced in, never interacting with anyone else.

</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/SurvivalOfTheFittest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/SurvivalOfTheFittest">Survival of the Fittest</a></em> has regular occurrences of this due to the extended pregame prologues prior to the students going into the death game. Characters who joined the cast far later in real time are treated as if they were there all along. This was much more pronounced in earlier versions, where new characters could join midway through the game and as a result, would appear on the island on Day 6 with the narrative brushing it off with a 'they were hiding'. Humorously played with in 'I Was There Too!' as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Darlene Sylvia</a> relates various high profile events in V7 pregame which she was supposedly around for, in the background and unnoticed.
