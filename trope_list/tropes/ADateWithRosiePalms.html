However, it's given quite a different treatment in fiction. Unlike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobodyPoops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobodyPoops">Nobody Poops</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPeriodsPeriod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPeriodsPeriod">No Periods, Period</a> (where the function is simply not mentioned because it would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NauseaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NauseaFuel">Nausea Fuel</a>), masturbation in fiction often fits into a few different categories:
</p><ul><li> It's aimed at or about teenagers (usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>) and the character is usually a horny teenage boy, and another character, usually the parents, think that he's masturbating when he is very obviously (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentInnuendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentInnuendo">or sometimes not so obviously</a>) <em>not</em>.
</li><li> The character masturbating is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodDateless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodDateless">sexually frustrated</a>, disturbed, perverted, or is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou">nerd/has no social life</a>. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexIsCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexIsCool">Sex Is Cool</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHasLotsOfSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHasLotsOfSex">Everybody Has Lots of Sex</a>, masturbating is portrayed as a shameful last resort for losers who can't get laid. Except for those depicting doing it as one part of a sexual encounter itself, of course.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> It's a single-sex setting such as a prison, boarding school, or military vessel, and the character is uninterested in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SituationalSexuality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SituationalSexuality">same-sex encounter</a>, so they take matters into their own... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">hand</a>.
</li><li> Artificial insemination due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyYouCanRepopulateMyRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyYouCanRepopulateMyRace">lack of partners</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLesbiansWantKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLesbiansWantKids">incompatible sexual orientation</a>, etc.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pornography" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pornography">porn</a> or erotica, it can be used for the sexual titillation of the viewers.
</li></ul><p>Of course, there's a pretty valid reason why "normal" masturbation isn't depicted very often â€” it's actually quite a mundane and meaningless thing (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/PeopleSitOnChairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/PeopleSitOnChairs">People Sit on Chairs</a>). There aren't many ways that masturbation could advance the plot of a story, and because it's generally a solitary activity, there usually won't be any character interaction involved.
</p><p>Also note that male masturbation is used far more often than female (except in porn, for the above-mentioned reasons)... though that's not to say that female masturbation isn't given <em>any</em> attention in fiction (the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Rumpelstiltskin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Rumpelstiltskin">Rumpelstiltskin</a>" tale supposedly had the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">original message</a>, "women who masturbate become infertile"). In older media, expect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfAbuse">references to hairy palms and/or blindness</a>, two widespread myths used to keep boys from masturbating.

</li><li> Farnese in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> is shown to be turned on by people burning alive to the point where she spends some "alone time" thinking very hard about that. <em>Berserk</em> is like that.

</li><li> Because <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Genshiken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Genshiken">Genshiken</a></em> is a manga/anime about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku">Otaku</a>, it features the characters reading or talking about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doujinshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doujinshi">Doujinshi</a>. Most Doujinshi are erotic, and the series alludes (or more than alludes) to several of the main characters (male and female alike), ah, getting use out of them for the sake of comedy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HighschoolOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HighschoolOfTheDead">Highschool of the Dead</a></em>: Played for laughs near the end of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeachEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeachEpisode">"Drifters of the Dead"</a></em> OVA special.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IchiTheKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IchiTheKiller">Ichi the Killer</a></em> has one of the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squick-tastic</a> examples ever. Ichi cuts his palm with a knife and masturbates to the sight of his favorite prostitute being beaten and raped by her husband.

One of the other characters explains it to him, and from that point on in the movie, he's shown using a grip-strengthener, deciding between bottles of lotion, and at the end <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">there's a poster of him as "Customer of the Year" in the Adult Video section of a video store</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBookOfRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBookOfRevelation">The Book of Revelation</a></em>: Another more disturbing example occurs in the Australian film. Daniel is captured by a group of anonymous women and, among other forms of sexual and psychological torture, is instructed by one of the masked women to masturbate. She then begins to masturbate herself, standing over him, before he defiantly tells her that when "every man masturbates, he only thinks of himself". Ouch!
</li><li> The protagonist Marie masturbates in the French horror film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighTension">High Tension</a></em> after seeing her best friend Alex showering through the bathroom window earlier that night.

Hilarious in its well-meaning ineptitude, the film combines typical earnest sex-ed material with the story of Jimmy, a lad going through puberty. As just one illustrative example of the painful "comedy" in Jimmy's story, at one point he's at the library, where he has to ask a hard-of-hearing librarian for help by loudly exclaiming "I want to know about the male penis!" One patron is so shocked by this that his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DodgyToupee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DodgyToupee">toupÃ©e</a> does a flip-take, flying several feet up off his head.
</li><li> The 1994 film <em>Spanking the Monkey</em> used masturbation as a thematic and symbolic plot device (as the title suggests). The young protagonist's sexual frustration as he cares for his convalescing mother is compounded by the fact that he never gets to successfully masturbate.
</li><li> Lester in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanBeauty">American Beauty</a></em> is obviously depressed, and more than once mentions masturbation in contrast with all he hates about his life.

</li><li> The feature film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Serenity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Serenity">Serenity</a></em> (based on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em> series) has a scene where a frustrated Kaylee gripes that "going on a year now, I ain't had nothin' twixt my nethers weren't run on batteries!" Much to the dismay of most of the crew, who were standing near her when she mentioned this:
<div class="indent"><strong>Mal:</strong> Oh, GOD! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooMuchInformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooMuchInformation">I can't know that!</a> <br/><strong>Jayne:</strong> I could stand to hear a little more.
</div></li><li> There's a scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MulhollandDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MulhollandDrive">Mulholland Dr.</a></em> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaomiWatts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaomiWatts">Naomi Watts</a> masturbates angrily while crying. She's spiralling into depression and a fit of mad jealousy, after a roller-coaster romance with another woman (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which may all have been a paranoid delusion anyway</span>) leaves her feeling emotionally abused.
</li><li> The remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Psycho1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Psycho1998">Psycho</a></em> recreated the original virtually shot-for-shot... except that, at the end of the peephole scene, Norman glances downward, and the sound of a closing zipper is plainly audible. Kind of obvious in retrospect.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SingleWhiteFemale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SingleWhiteFemale">Single White Female</a></em>, the mentally disturbed Hedy masturbates after seeing her roommate have sex.
</li><li> The scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pleasantville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pleasantville">Pleasantville</a></em> comes to mind. Some serious repression up until that point, to set a <strong>tree</strong> on fire.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VelvetGoldmine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VelvetGoldmine">Velvet Goldmine</a></em>, Arthur Stuart (played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristianBale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristianBale">Christian Bale</a>) is caught masturbating by his father, and is <em>kicked out of the house</em> for his perceived crime. It's unclear whether the father just took a really dim view of masturbation in general, or if he noticed that his son was looking at a homoerotic image.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSilenceOfTheLambs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSilenceOfTheLambs">The Silence of the Lambs</a></em>, Miggs, the prisoner in the cell next to Hannibal Lecter's, masturbates and flings his semen on Clarice Starling. It's this unforgivable "rudeness" that compels Lecter to aide Starling.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AceVenturaWhenNatureCalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AceVenturaWhenNatureCalls">Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls</a></em>, the titular character masturbates (as seen by his shadow) in a hut after a close conversation with the tribal princess. He gets walked in on by the correspondent who accompanied him. His excuse is he was just "practicing my mantra" and will finish his "meditation" in 10 minutes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackSwan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackSwan">Black Swan</a></em>: Somewhat averted in that Nina's time alone is suggested to her by her ballet instructor (yes, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurrealHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurrealHorror">that kind of movie</a>), but Nina clearly has massive psychosexual issues.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ASerbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ASerbian">A Serbian</a> Film</em>, the main character's brother talks to the main character's wife about being single, and then takes a trip to the little boy's room to (predictably) masturbate. It doesn't help that at another part in the movie, a porn director talks about how the main reason porn is popular is so people can "cum into a napkin what they couldn't into a woman."
</li><li> In one scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AClockworkOrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AClockworkOrange">A Clockwork Orange</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> Alex masturbates in his room after a night of "ultra-violence" while listening to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundtrackDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundtrackDissonance">Beethoven's Ninth Symphony</a>, staring at his sacrilegious decor, and fantasizing about violent and satanic images.

It's also an example of the "mental health/sexual frustration" variety of masturbation in that the other recruits referred to him as a "crazy fucker" and that it ultimately got him scheduled for a Section 8 discharge<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note045wd');"><sup>*Â </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note045wd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note045wd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Section 8 is a military discharge for those deemed mentally unfit for service</span> when he was caught doing it in the waiting room after being sent to see a Navy psychologist, and he ultimately would have gotten shipped out if not for him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">getting killed by a VC booby trap</span>.

<ul><li> Lloyd masturbated so he could sleep after the Captain Trips superflu killed everyone in the prison but him.
</li><li> The fat, homely and awkward Harold was nicknamed "Whack-Off Lauder" in high school from a rumor that he habitually masturbated into his pants. Throughout the story, he gradually becomes more fit, attractive, and confident, practically thriving in the post-apocalypse world... but there are still disastrous consequences for the torment he was put through.
</li><li> Stu replies to HaroldÂ’s fear that heÂ’ll rape Frannie by saying itÂ’s not necessary if a man is good with his hands.

<ul><li> Roland Deschain provides personal compensation by stating the fact that even though he's missing a few fingers on his right hand (a previously fine-tuned killing machine of a hand), it's fine because "I jack off left-handed."
</li><li> In a flashback, a fourteen-year-old Roland was planning to do this until he is called aside by Marten to show him that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's been having sex with Roland's mom</span>. He tops off the scene by telling Roland "I hope you enjoy your hand."
</li><li> In another flashback, Susan Delgado masturbates for the first time a few hours after meeting Roland.
</li><li> The young, psychotic Detta Walker indulged in this while doing destructive things such as breaking plates.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTalisman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTalisman">The Talisman</a></em>, when Jack meets the friendly bumpkin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent">Wolf</a> in the Territories, Wolf starts casually playing "pocket pool" in his overalls while explaining his role as shepherd.

</li><li> A female example in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightHuntress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightHuntress">Night Huntress</a></em> books. Cat is just beginning to accept her own sexuality. A few hours after making out with her love interest, she takes a bath and accidentally touches herself. Then she does it on purpose, and <em>then</em> she starts to get really into it.
</li><li> A weird but very sweet version in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRedTent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRedTent">The Red Tent</a></em>. In the time of Jacob in the Bible, when girls get their first period their female relatives have a ceremony for them and uses a goddess statue to gently break their hymen, letting the blood soak into the earth. It's a warm, loving and even humorous ceremony; the girl is given drugs to help her relax. The main character Dinah actually has an orgasm.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a>'s <em>The Gods Themselves</em>, a race of parallel universe is featured which can (to an extent) control their own density and are having sex by merging with each other. Alternately, they can use the decreased density to either pull the tips of their limbs through each other (the feeling afterwards was described by someone as "nicely sleepy") or by trying to merge with a rock. To those who still don't get the analogy, the latter is called <em>rock-rubbing</em>. Both are considered socially unacceptable.

</li><li> Similar passages in Blume's <em>Then Again, Maybe I Won't</em> have made the book a favorite target of censors. Or perhaps it's because of the boy protagonist's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaughtyBirdwatching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaughtyBirdwatching">nocturnal activities</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfTheOtori" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfTheOtori">Tales of the Otori</a></em>, sexuality in general is given generally pragmatic treatment: occasionally it's an important part of the plot, but for the most part it's just in the background of the characters' lives. As such, masturbation is mentioned, but only... off-handedly.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Skinny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Skinny">Skinny</a></em> has a rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">squicky</a> scene where a young girl masturbates while in the tub.

</li><li> A staple of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipRoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipRoth">Philip Roth</a>'s oeuvre; his characters, whether sexually repressed or otherwise, are generally more likely to masturbate than to engage in actual sex. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PortnoysComplaint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PortnoysComplaint">Portnoy's Complaint</a></em> takes it to the extreme: the titular complaint is that, apparently, Jewish men aren't supposed to masturbate, while the protagonist does it a <strong>lot</strong> throughout the course of the book.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnatomyOfABoyfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnatomyOfABoyfriend">Anatomy Of A Boyfriend</a></em>: The main character is unable to experience "the big O" with her high school sweetheart.

</li><li> A subversion appears in a somewhat obscure POW narrative from WWII called <em>Yanks Don't Cry</em>. When the camp doctor claims the mass outbreak of night blindness is being caused by masturbation, all of the men are horrified by the very suggestion that they could be masturbating. This may be because the author didn't want to admit to whacking off when the book was published in 1947, or have more to do with the prevailing attitudes towards masturbation at the time. At any rate, he mentions the burning envy every man felt for one inmate's ability to have lucid wet dreams whenever he wanted.

("Nut" being slang for a part of the male crotch, and scratch being the "masturbate" synonym.)

Which he later happily admits he wasn't actually doing. In addition, in Private Lives his answer to Wilson's question about what he's doing that night is simply a gleeful "Masturbating!"
</li><li> When House went bowling with Chase (in "No More Mr. Nice Guy"), he explained that this was because bowling isn't "one of the two things guys do by themselves." Chase, knowing House very well, asked what the <em>second</em> thing is... "Other hand," replies House.

He gets interrogated harshly but can't stick up for himself until Nick quietly takes him to the side and tells him that there's nothing wrong with masturbation.

<ul><li> In an earlier episode, the team try to find a way to advertise something that claims to be a way of losing weight, but really is actually a device for female masturbation.

</li><li> "First Orgasm" is about a lonely girl masturbating on a Thursday morning and eventually declaring, "I think I could last at least week without someone to hold me".
</li><li> "Coin-Operated Boy" is an ode to vibrators.
</li></ul></li><li> From "Telepathy" by Swans: "I saw you through the window/Masturbating to the violence" (by the standards of M. Gira's work, this is a fairly tame example)
</li><li> "Homemade" by Sebadoh is about becoming addicted to masturbation due to depression and loneliness.
</li><li> "Touch of my Hand" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears">Britney Spears</a> is about appreciating self-love in the absence of one's partner.
</li><li> "Oops (Oh My)" by Tweet; she admires herself in the mirror while touching herself.
</li><li> Diva Destruction's "The Broken Ones" appears to be about this:
<div class="indent">Pornography exposed <br/>Innocence unrobed <br/>Masturbate your emptiness <br/>Fornicate your selfishness
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Weezer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Weezer">Weezer</a>'s "Why Bother" is about giving up on romantic relationships due to fear of heartbreak, and briefly mentions masturbation in this context:
<div class="indent">But it's just sexual attraction <br/>Not something real, so I'd rather keep whacking
</div></li><li> A lot of people thought the song "Holdin' My Own" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDarkness">The Darkness</a> was about masturbation, though the band themselves denied this.
</li><li> The song "Unglued" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StoneTemplePilots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StoneTemplePilots">Stone Temple Pilots</a> is about masturbation.
<ul><li> As is their song "Crackerman". <em>Slightly</em> more subtle than "Unglued" but still painfully obvious in the first stanza.
</li></ul></li><li> The Australian band The Divinyls has a song titled "I Touch Myself"; you can guess what that implies.
</li><li> Ska band Desorden Publico has a song, "Manuela", who is half <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou">Intercourse with You</a>, half this trope, down to the title (who is a transparent allusion to the way "Rosie Palms" is known in Spanish). To add controversy to the mix, part of the lyrics are taken from real letters that the Liberator Simon Bolivar sent to his lover Manuela Saenz.
</li><li> Mexican Hard Rock band Cuca also has a song called "Manuela". Translated loosely, the first verse has the singer bragging that because of his ...habit, he "is a being incapable of being manipulated, because he's self-sufficient, and even believes he's intelligent"
</li><li> There's an old Cuban song <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBnG5DVi4x0">"Manuela no me pelea"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> ("Manuela doesn't fight with me"), about a man who lives a wonderful life because he can party late and his wife Manuela doesn't get mad and fight him. Anyone who doesn't get thisâ€”whether or not they speak Spanishâ€”is officially living under a rock.
</li><li> "Blister in the Sun", by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ViolentFemmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ViolentFemmes">Violent Femmes</a>. ("Big Hands, I know you're the one...")
</li><li> "Pictures of Lily", by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who</a>.
</li><li> "Rosie" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JacksonBrowne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JacksonBrowne">Jackson Browne</a>; it's pretty blatant in the chorus. "Rosie, you wear my ring" and "I got to hand it to me" indeed...
</li><li> "Get a Grip" by Semisonic. The music video toys with it by using a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">very suggestively framed shots of people exercising at a gym</a>.
</li><li> "Teenage Kicks" by the Undertones.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChuckBerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChuckBerry">Chuck Berry</a>'s "My Ding-a-Ling" blends this trope with a bucketload of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre">Double Entendre</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel">Billy Joel</a>'s "Sometimes a Fantasy" (in the context of phone sex)
<ul><li> Also mentioned in "Captain Jack." "Your sister's gone out, she's on a date/ You just sit at home and masturbate."
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToriAmos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToriAmos">Tori Amos</a>' "Icicle" is about doing this... in church.
<ul><li> To be more specific, it's about her getting off to Jesus while her father is singing prayers downstairs.
</li></ul></li><li> Reverend Horton Heat's "One Time for Me" is about getting off on watching somebody <em>else</em> doing this.
</li><li> "She Bop" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CyndiLauper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CyndiLauper">Cyndi Lauper</a>. She thought she'd written this one cleverly enough that young people wouldn't understand it till they got older, but the cat was out of the bag pretty quickly.
</li><li> "Touching Me Touching You" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Squeeze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Squeeze">Squeeze</a>. "I'm always touching myself/ I've got nothing else to do/ And when I'm touching myself/ I'm always thinking about you...."
</li><li> "Fingers" and "U + Ur Hand" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pink">P!nk</a>, with the latter song suggesting that jerks in the bar will have to settle for this because she's not interested.

</li><li> "Later Tonight" by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetShopBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetShopBoys">Pet Shop Boys</a> is subtler than some examples here but still unambiguous.
</li><li> "Imaginary Lover" by the Atlanta Rhythm Section. One of the rare examples of a song that's unambiguously about masturbation and managed to still become a US Top 10 hit (Yes, it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>)

</li><li> Masturbation is pretty much the signature subject of British comedian Ivor Biggun, who has at LEAST half a dozen songs about it such as "I'm a Wanker", "The Wanker's Rock and Roll", and "Wanking Your Blues Away".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GreenDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GreenDay">Green Day</a>'s "Longview". "Bite my lip and close my eyes, take me away to paradise...", "When masturbation's lost its fun...", "some say quit or I'll go blind", and "I'm so damn bored I'm going blind", in reference to the myth.
<ul><li> Then there's "All By Myself", the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenTrack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenTrack">Hidden Track</a> on that same album. "I was all by myself/there was nobody looking/I was thinking of you."
</li><li> A song from the Green Day side-project The Network is called "Right Hand-A-Rama" and is about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">exactly what you think it's about.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madonna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madonna">Madonna</a>'s song "Secret" is clearly about this: "Happiness lies in your own <em>hand</em>..."

</li><li> "Zwitter" by Rammstein is about a hermaphrodite who is in love with hirself, and even claims to be able to make hirself conceive...
</li><li> "Menage a Moi" by Chick McGee of <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bobandtom.com">The Bob And Tom Show<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JonLajoie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JonLajoie">Jon Lajoie</a>'s "Alone in the Universe" is about nothing but masturbation.

</li><li> Jellyfish's "He's My Best Friend", where lots of double entendre makes it clear that the "friend" in question is actually the narrator's penis (a couple of the more blatant examples being "my hand's a five leaf clover /it's Palm Sunday over and over" and "I pick him up when he's feeling down / I guess he's always been hanging around"). Funnily enough, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance">the music is innocent-sounding enough</a> that the song <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsntItIronic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsntItIronic">was included on an official iTunes "Friendship Songs Mix"</a>.
</li><li> Mindless Self Indulgence's song <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyKDNp9uRSY">Masturbates<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The name says it all, really.
</li><li> "Boy" by Book of Love": "I sit at home at night, and play with my toys"
</li><li> Captain Jack - "Little Boy".
</li><li> "Guys Eyes" by Animal Collective appears to be about masturbating so as not to look like all the narrator wants his girlfriend for is fox sex. See lines: "I really want to do just what my body wants to, I really want to show to my girl that I want her", "I want to do what my body needs to, I want to show to my girl that I need her", and "I started using my mind, And I used my hands, It was what I want to do"

This was the song that prompted Tipper Gore to establish the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">PMRC</a> and require the Explicit Advisory sticker on raunchy recordings.

The girls are both relieved and happy to pose for pictures.
</li><li> "The Big 'M'" by Lust Control
</li><li> "Depuis que tu n'es plus lÃ " by the French comedian Max Boublil sounds like a romantic song at first but it really is about masturbation. He even says that he is going to marry his right hand.

<ul><li> Billy has said MANY TIMES that it's about Japanese dance clubs. And yet no one really listens...

<ul><li> One episode deals with Reverend Putty's private shame over his masturbation. And then his ire when he found out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithATestTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithATestTube">Stalker with a Test Tube</a> used his...ahem, tissues to impregnate herself with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Stephanie</span>.

He ends up impregnating the entire neighborhood.</span>

When Brock demurs, Rusty admits the movie was "meant to be watched <em>solo a mano</em>." He's also deaf to warnings that the movie doesn't live up to its title.
</li><li> 24 is seen perusing porn several times due to the low chance of meeting women in his henching job.
<div class="indent"><strong>24:</strong> Don't knock or anything! It's not like I live with 80 guys and no women, so there is <em>no chance that I am masturbating!</em>
</div></li><li> This is revealed to be the reason that Rusty invented the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">joy can</a>". And the reason that it locks from the inside.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForMasturbating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForMasturbating">I'm practicing being a boyfriend, Pop!</a>" Actually, he was just kissing his hand to practice kissing.
</li><li> The Monarch is at a monitor watching Dr. Girlfriend seduce Rusty and absently starts fondling himself, breaking off abruptly when a henchman wanders through for a glass of juice.
</li><li> In the "Trial of the Monarch" episode, in a flashback, Dr. Girlfriend is handed her old superhero costume by her old boyfriend (Phantom Limb). She remarks that there are now "hard chunks" in the fabric, which Limb claims are tears. Monarch naturally decries this, claiming that Limb was "just pounding his invisible meat" into it, at which point he's cut off by Dr. Venture, who doesn't want the boys hearing about that. But then Hank protests it's okay because he's seen Dean do it, at which point Brock quickly gets the boys to another topic. The judge didn't want to hear it either:
<div class="indent"><strong>Judge:</strong> I want that comment stricken from the record <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainBleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainBleach">and my mind.</a></em>

The over-the-top line had been included for the studio's annual in-house gag reel, with the expectation that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediaWatchdog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediaWatchdog">Hays Office</a> would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CensorDecoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CensorDecoy">order it excised</a> (and overlook the lesser jokes they actually wanted to keep) before the short was released to the public; amazingly, it was allowed to go out intact.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether">Drawn Together</a></em> has Foxxy show Wooldoor, in elaborate detail, how she masturbates in "Clum Babies". Because it's about as sexual as a potato singing "Baa Baa Black Sheep", <em>Wooldoor</em> masturbating is shown multiple times. It involves breaking his own finger, among other things. Go figure.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCritic">The Critic</a></em> when Margo Sherman has to attend a debutante's ball, she wears a white dress symbolizing her virginity â€” except (as she points out) the <em>gloves</em>, which are hussy white.
<div class="indent"><strong>Dressmaker:</strong> We dressmakers have a very strict code, so I need to know. Do you deserve to wear virginal white? Because if you don't, you'll have to wear an off white, what we call a "hussy white". So which will it be? White white? <br/><strong>Margo Sherman:</strong> Yes... um, except for the gloves.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em>:
<ul><li> An episode has Zelda refuse to have sex with Link after saving her from Gannon. So Link says to his hand, "Then I will save you, my princess."

</li><li> When you wake up in the morning, what's the first thing that you see? It's your morning wood! "Hello, I'm Bruce Campbell, and I can't start my day by waxing my morning wood."
</li><li> One of the nerds, Daniel, apparently made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewYearsResolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewYearsResolution">New Year's Resolution</a> not to masturbate.

Actually a pretty surprising amount for a show on FOX at that time.
<ul><li> A great one, Dr. Zoidberg laments how he will get rid of his male jelly when he fails to mate. Fry holds up his dismembered arm and says "I'll lend you this."
</li><li> From "<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FuturamaS4E12SpanishFry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FuturamaS4E12SpanishFry">Spanish Fry</a>", the Omicronian Emperor Lrr wants to use Fry's "lower horn" as an aphrodisiac. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentInnuendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentInnuendo">Innocent Innuendo</a>' is used, which Bender points out and jokes about.
<div class="indent"><strong>Lrr:</strong> I think I'll have Fry's lower horn jerked. <br/><strong>Bender:</strong> It's used to it! Woo!
</div></li><li> In one of the What-If machine episodes, a recently turned human Bender tried to "fix his antenna" down there. But Fry quickly stopped him from doing it because it'll "make God cry."
</li><li> In "<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FuturamaS2E7AHeadInThePolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FuturamaS2E7AHeadInThePolls">A Head in the Polls</a>", Richard Nixon's head tells Fry and Leela that he loved his body, this resulted in this quote:

</div></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BigMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BigMouth">Big Mouth</a></em> features Andrew Glouberman, a pubescent boy, who masturbates to deal with his spontaneous erections, as well as after he discovers porn.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em>: As a typical 14-year-old boy, Morty is a chronic masturbator. He awkwardly warns Jerry not to come into his room when he's on the internet because who knows what he could be looking at, and only makes a half-hearted attempt to explain away that he's using an alien sex doll robot in his room before just giving up and going back to it. In Season 2's "Total Rickall", a flashback reveals Summer coming home early to find him masturbating in the kitchen. When she demands to know why the hell he's doing it in the kitchen, in embarrassment he angrily declares that he does it in every room of the house (and as she flees, he defiantly shouts after her that he was thinking of her best friend). In "The Ricks Must Be Crazy", after Morty spends a few months trapped on a primitive alien planet without his laptop, he admits to masturbating to "an extra-curvy piece of driftwood".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown">Xiaolin Showdown</a></em>: At the end of "Year of The Green Monkey", while hanging outside down in his monkey form, Omi suddenly feels the urge to scratch in a place he has never scratched before.
