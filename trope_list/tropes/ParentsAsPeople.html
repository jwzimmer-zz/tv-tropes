When they <em>remember</em> him, they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DotingParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DotingParent">Doting Parents</a> it's just that they keep forgetting he exists.
</p><p>Unlike the all-powerful but undercharacterised <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentExMachina">Parent ex Machina</a>, the reader/viewer knows about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">The Protagonist</a>'s parents. They have friends outside the home, hobbies that take them out of the house and full time jobs. The audience will also be able to discern what kind of relationship the two have as a couple—whether they're still as starry-eyed over each other as they were when they started dating, or on the brink of divorce. They will have quirks, character strengths and character failings.
</p><p>They'll also be hopeless as parents.
</p><p>This couple are not usually nasty—or, if they are, we'll be told all about their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a>. They're probably at least sympathetic, if not downright likable. We'd probably like to have them as friends, but definitely wouldn't want them as parents.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>If you're a protagonist, and your parents are given lots of witty one liners, lots of characterisation and inhabit the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetenceZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetenceZone">Competence Zone</a> to some degree, expect to suffer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">Parental Abandonment</a> as they pursue their hobbies and relationships at your expense. If mum and dad are still together, you'll be a living example of the phrase "the children of lovers are orphans," as the parental units will be too wrapped up in each other to spend much time with you. On the other hand, if they're fighting constantly, they'll be too busy yelling at each other to notice that you haven't eaten in three days.
</p><p>One particular type of this parent is one, usually-single parent that is firmly in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetenceZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetenceZone">Competence Zone</a>, and probably a part of their child's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme">zany schemes.</a> Their friends will think these parents are "cool" and they will probably agree he just wishes his dad would occasionally show up to parents' night, and that mum remembered to cook dinner every so often.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The "golfing dad" is an old trope, and if dad's the only absent parent the child probably won't suffer too badly (until the plot calls for it). However, if <em>mum</em> has a hobby that takes her out of the house, works at a demanding job or has a problem that makes her borderline unfit as a parent, parental neglect will almost certainly be a plot point. How it's approached varies from show to show, from the mother realising she'd go mad without her career, to an enormous guilt trip about abandoning her child.
</p><p>If this happens in a family of sufficiently high social standing, particularly in a medieval setting (being a king requires a lot of work, you know), there is a chance that the protagonist and/or one or more of his siblings may become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp">Royally Screwed Up</a> as a result.
</p><p>Unlike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentExMachina">Parent ex Machina</a>, these parents aren't infallible, and they can't solve all of their kids' problems because they can barely handle their own. Their son or daughter can't blithely assume that "dad will take care of it," because he won't. Or he'll try to and fail spectacularly.
</p><p>To compensate, there's usually an alternative <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mentors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mentors">mentor</a> who fills in for the absent or ineffective parent. If not, the child will be an adult long before his time as being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> in a crazy family will force them to take care of themselves. If they're the oldest sibling, they'll probably <em>be</em> the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToParent">alternative parent</a>."

<ul><li> The Hirasawa parents in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn">K-On!</a></em> are usually away on romantic hijinks, leaving younger sister Ui to serve as a surrogate parent for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolander</a> Yui. In the manga, the rest of the main cast finally meet them <em>on the day of Yui's entrance exam to college</em>, and only because they came over because they were worried she might sleep too late.
</li><li> Prof. Yumi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em> sincerely loved and cared for his daughter Sayaka, but he was too <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarriedToTheJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarriedToTheJob">Married to the Job</a> and busy trying to save the world to take care of her properly, and often Sayaka missed her father.
</li><li> Momomiya Ichigo's parents in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew">Tokyo Mew Mew</a></em> are completely wrapped up in each other. Her mother is quick to squeal over whichever boy she's seen her daughter with, and her father is overprotective and goes off on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RantInducingSlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RantInducingSlight">Rant-Inducing Slight</a>. However, they're shuffled off to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">Parental Abandonment</a>-land when she has to save the world, only to come back and punish her for being late to get home. They're seen as good people, they just don't get it.
</li><li> Izumi's mother from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullMoon">Full Moon</a></em> is eventually depicted as this, though she was originally more portrayed as an abusive woman. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Her husband's apparently sudden and early death had her stricken with grief, to the point that she wasn't capable of giving comfort to her son, Izumi/Leo, and caring well for him, needing comfort herself. She got her comfort by continuously dating and sleeping with men, but their rejection because she had a child was too much for her and she, wrongly, blamed him for it. When Izumi/Leo runs off and commits suicide in front of her, she realizes the mistakes she has made and that she was not and could not be a good mother to him, even crying when she sees that her son prefers death than to live with her any longer</span>
</li><li> Part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> revolves around this trope. Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobot">Super Robot</a> shows have a teenage mecha pilot and a long-absent father who designed the mecha, so <em>Evangelion</em> shows how traumatizing it would be for a real teen to fight in a giant robot—and what kind of father would be long-absent to design the robot.
<ul><li> If one were to account parental guardians in this, Misato definitely counts. She tries as hard as she can to be nurturing and protective to Shinji and Asuka, but due to her own pressing emotional baggage, she has trouble getting close to them.
</li><li> In fact Super Robot series very, very often show the teenagers being traumatized due to the absence of their parents. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em>? Dr. Kabuto was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> in the original manga, Sayaka missed her father constantly and it took a long while for Shiro to forgive his and Kouji's father for letting them believe he was dead FOR YEARS. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger">Great Mazinger</a></em>?

Hiroshi Shiba stated in the FIRST episode that he thought his father could not care less about his family and therefore he could not care less about him, only realizing that this wasn't true when Dr. Shiba <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiedInYourArmsTonight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiedInYourArmsTonight">passed away in his arms</a> (and later it was shown that, no matter what his father's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading">computer-mind</a> told him, Hiroshi was still hurt). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Zambot3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Zambot3">Zambot3</a></em>? His father being missing right when he needed him was one of the many traumas Kappei Jin was forced to endure throughout the series. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>?

They did not seem to give their younger child the time of day until <em>he</em> started showing signs of genius tendencies and it was like Osamu reborn. They were understandably repentant when Ken, to all appearances, ran away from home and came back with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia">Easy Amnesia</a>, culminating in him acknowledging them as his parents again, and ever since then their relationship is more normal.

<ul><li> Note that he did not tell them deliberately, since there was the very real risk of the kids refusing to go through with the plan <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And allowing the D-Reaper to fuse Mother D-Reaper and Cable Reaper to complete its plan, i.e, the end of all life</span>.

After three daughters (who he doesn't seem to have concerned himself with), he is delighted with his son, who he sees as "an ally in a house full of women." He no longer bothers pretending to be respectable, and fills the house with his assorted friends, including thieves and criminals of various types, introducing his son into this social sphere. Dorian takes to thievery like a duck to water, and his father encourages this.

However, there's no question that her father loves her, and that she loves him and understands that he's a very important man (being the Vice Foreign Minister to <em>the entire planet</em>).

Plus he stops smacking Conan around as time passes, and starts treating him more like an actual son than as just a kid who happens to be under his watch.
</li><li> While both of Shinichi's parents love their son, they've been rather irresponsible regarding him. They have no qualms about leaving their teenage boy to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect">look after himself for years on end while they jetset around the world</a>—something they've apparently done since the end of his preteen years. Shinichi himself loves his parents and is clearly inspired by his father's detective skills, but is well aware that they're far too irresponsible to be proper parents and thus feels no guilt about doing things like telling his dad's editor where he's hiding while skipping deadlines, or using their credit cards to pay for expensive dinners.

On the <em>other</em> other hand, said "convoluted scene" involved posing as crime syndicate members, kidnapping their own son, and tricking him into believing that they had executed everyone he knew and loved, all to emphasize the danger of the situation to him as well as test his competency in such a scenario. After genuinely terrorizing their son for two entire days, they treat this cruel and ruthless tactic as a hilarious prank. This did <em>not</em> help the fanbase's opinion of them.

One of the requirements is that the player has had a Neurolinker since shortly after birth; the most common reason for that is as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect">advanced baby monitor</a>, so that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">parents don't have to spend much actual time with the baby</a> - Kuroyukihime hypothesizes this is pretty much the core trauma for almost all Burst Linkers. In fact, it's one of the reasons that Burst Linkers are so passionate about the game; they're usually closer to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoundFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoundFamily">Found Family</a> they have in the game to the people they live with in real life.

Haruyuki himself never mentions his father; he doesn't seem to have even been in contact with him since his parent's divorce, and has some kind of trauma from that time frame that he seems to have repressed the memory of (it's hinted in one of the 'extra' episodes of the anime that this is at least partially responsible for his weight issues). Because his mother works for an international bank, he only sees her for about five minutes every morning when she's half-asleep (one of the reasons his apartment seems to be the main Team Gathering point for their Guild). The only reason he hasn't gone completely off the rails by the time the story starts is Chiyuri's parents, who "raised them like twins" until fairly recently (Chiyu's mother caters for pretty much every Guild meeting because she's so glad Haru has so many friends now, and Chiyu's always urging Haru to come by and visit with her parents). This trope is averted in the case of Chiyu herself, who is the only confirmed exception to this hands-off parenting rule - she was given a neurolinker shortly after birth because her father had damaged vocal chords from cancer, and the Neurolinker was the only way she could hear her father's voice.

The mother got onto a plane to be with her daughter, only for the plane to crash and kill her. Maria has become convinced that her mother's death was her fault and that her father hates her for this. Lory wants for her to realize that it isn't the case, but nothing he says works. She's heard all of the arguments before, so she sees them as nothing but empty words... until Kyoko uses a play's words to 'switch roles' with Maria, and makes Maria use those 'empty words' as her own argument to prove that her father <em>does</em> love her.

Sirius sees them as manipulative, power-hungry and bigoted tyrants and wants to have nothing to do with them. However, the series puts a painstaking effort to show that for all their flaws, both parents do love their wayward eldest son and wants him back in the family; it's just that Walburga's naturally astringent personality and Orion's closed-offness, in addition to their clashing ideas of what's good and bad, leads to communication problems that, more often than not, leads to hostile interactions.

Shizune is frustrated with her father's persistent attempts to get her to speak (in the fic, it's indicated that she can speak but sounds terrible), but sees that he wants her to succeed and appreciates that he doesn't treat her any differently from her non-disabled brother.

They agreed to let Harry be raised by the Dursleys (who were actually willing to take him in, and only got their canon treatment because they were cursed by an escaped Death Eater out for revenge) due to Dumbledore's unfortunate advice to protect Harry from his brother's fame.

Ragyo really cares about her daughters but, due to Satsuki's poor health, she coddled her a bit too much to the point of being doting and overprotective, leaving after a fight with her husband, which, after her husband's death, left her daughters to fend for themselves while she was unaware (until much later). In the latter case, while Satsuki genuinely cares for Ryuuko, it's made clear that she has a slew of issues that hasn't left her able to care for herself properly, let alone her sister.

Having been separated from his children, Katara and Sokka, for most of the series, he's trying to make up for lost time, which often involves fairly embarrassing attempts to be a "cool dad." More seriously, though, he doesn't fully understand how much Sokka and Katara have changed in his absence (particularly how Katara can no longer simply accept the Southern Water Tribe's patriarchal traditions), and takes his children keeping secrets from him poorly.

Shouzou even calls Kyouko out on it in chapter 15, stating her actions have done more harm than good and if it makes Asuna hate them for it, then it's <em>not</em> worth it.
</li><li> Howard Stark in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/SecondChancesSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/SecondChancesSeries">Second Chances Series</a></em> admits that he was a terrible father but it was largely due to a combination of his poor people skills and the demands of running a multimillion dollar business. Even times he deliberately avoided Tony was because he knew things would devolve into a fight and was trying to avoid that. When the reconcile, Tony realizes that his relationship with his father was so terrible because they're exactly alike.
</li><li> Stoick in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Persephone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Persephone">Persephone</a></em> truly did love his son and is stunned when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hiccup tells him he thinks he was only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow">Loving a Shadow</a> when he thought Hiccup was excelling in dragon-training</span>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Valka</span>'s relationship with her son is only <em>slightly</em> better. Astrid's parents agreed to Stoick's decision to sacrifice her out of desperation and pressure from (almost) the entire village to do so, though they regret the decision even before it becomes apparent that it didn't work. Relationships are strained, to say the least.
</li><li> Some of the conflict in <em>Secret Sunshine</em> is implied to be related to this on Satsuki's end. From what can be said, she does care about her daughter, Kiko, but, if her telling her sister, "I know but I'm not ready for any of this." is a clue, she wasn't ready for motherhood and, so, didn't want to deal with the responsibilities, foisting them onto Ryuuko.
<ul><li> Ryuuko has some shades of this, too, as, like Satsuki, she wasn't ready to raise a child and, while she loves her niece and can't picture life without her, she still has her own issues (among other things) to contend with and is pretty overwhelmed, especially when it comes to taking care of Kiko and herself.

In <em>The Suitcase Kid,</em> Andy's divorced parents marry new partners who already have families of their own. Her parents are so involved with their new lives that they don't realize they're using Andy as a pawn to "get back" at each other. In <em>The Diamond Girls</em>, the heroine and her sisters have lived in continual disorder all their lives, with their mother frequently changing boyfriends and moving her family to new homes. <em>Amber</em>, an early novel, was about a girl who rebels against her traveller mother and struggles to live a normal life.

Davey's mother turns into pretty much a space cadet for most of the novel, unable to function, and transplants Davey and her brother Jason to the opposite side of the country.

<ul><li> The gods in general tend to be this, to greater or lesser degrees, towards their demigod children. Some examples:
<ul><li> Poseidon, upon meeting his son Percy for the first time, flat-out tells him that he regrets siring him - not out of cruelty, just because of all the problems that have resulted from it, and the fact that he broke an oath in doing so - and that he's not sure what to make of him. Their relationship remains awkward, but improves as the series goes on, and Poseidon is one of the more doting of the godly parents in his own way.
</li><li> Hades once directly says to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his son Nico's face that he wished the boy's older sister Bianca had survived instead of him, and openly criticizes Nico's abilities. However, he is later shown acting fond and even proud of his son, and in the sequel series is said to occasionally make awkward efforts to be "fatherly", such as gifting Nico with a zombie chauffeur, though Bianca's memory remains as a cloud over their relationship. He even encourages Nico in his inter-personal relationships, expressing a desire for his son to find the happiness that so few of his children ever have. Also, as Pluto, he deliberately avoids openly interacting with or even acknowledging his daughter Hazel, as she is technically breaking the laws of the Underworld by returning to the living world after her death, and he wants to give her another chance at life instead of enforcing his own law and bringing her back.</span>
</li><li> Even Zeus/Jupiter, though he often tends to slide into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect">Parental Neglect</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parent</a> territory (the latter more so with his godly children than the half-bloods), has been shown as conflicted, once expressing to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his son Jason</span> that he wishes he could be more of a father to his children but feels that he must maintain distance, as he is king of the gods and must make hard decisions that affect the fate of the entire world.

The mother spends all her time keeping the school in order, and all four girls are really <em>shockingly</em> neglected. Getting food regularly involves raiding the school kitchens and doing their best to get away with it. Both parents, however, despite fairly limited page time due to their disinterest in their children, are highly realized characters with internal lives of whose shape we get a sense.

They couldn't find enough food to support themselves, but a few years into this some still paired off and had children. This meant there were more mouths to feed, and not enough food for any of them, especially as more and more of the adults died from animal attacks and fevers. The remaining adults <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> started to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">feed the bodies to their children</a></span>, a practice which the kids adopted when the last parent died, when the oldest child was seven.

It's discussed when Miss Williams, a governess, explains to Poirot that middle-class children know that their parents love them, but the parents are too busy providing for them to pay them attention. The affluent murder victim, on the other hand, and his wife led such intense lives that the baby could never be their first concern.

<ul><li> Vashti and Champagne see maintaining humanity as their highest goal. Thus they raise many children, but don't spend too much energy on any one of them, which leads to tensions between Penny and her siblings. Vashti spends most of her time researching; Champagne spends hers on studying and composing artwork.
</li><li> Isaac sees the spirituality of humanity as a key component of its revival and does not accept rebellion against his fundamentalist principles. This drives a wedge between him and his teenage son, as well as between his fundamentalist oldest child and the younger siblings.
</li><li> Halloween teaches his son all the skills that Halloween needed to survive. He does not adapt to the circumstances around them, nor does he train Deuce to address novel situations.

</li><li> Molly Weasley is a good person with noble intentions and is an excellent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a> for Harry; but because she has so many kids and is very overwhelmed at times, her youngest son Ron feels ignored/neglected sometimes. She also sometimes has a tendency to treat Harry better than her own children, particularly Ron, when her other children are right next to Harry.
</li><li> Sirius, as Harrys guardian in the Magical World, does truly love him and and want the best for him. However, he got locked in a horrible prison for twelve years for a crime he didnt commit at 22 and has a nasty case of arrested development because of it. Even though hes twenty-one years older than Harry, hes emotionally more like eight or nine years older than him. He just doesnt quite have the maturity to be the parent Harry needs and treats him more like buddy or brother. Spending a year stuck in his abusive childhood home only exacerbates this.
</li><li> Dumbledore does genuinely love Harry like the son he never had but like Sirius he's got a lot of issues that stop him from ever properly expressing that. He's a well meaning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> but he's still very manipulative, including to Harry. He still hates himself for something bad he did as a teenager (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">causing his sister's death</span>) and therefore can't open up to people (he never apologized to his brother for what happened either for similar reasons. There's also the fact that he knows <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Harry is going to have to die to stop Voldemort</span>. It says a lot that both Harry and his brother have to clear up everything between the two of them and learn to forgive him from information they get from the other.
</li></ul></li><li> Janine Hathaway from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VampireAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VampireAcademy">Vampire Academy</a></em> is a legendary guardian but Mother of the Year she is not.

</li><li> Kasia's mother Wensa in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Uprooted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Uprooted">Uprooted</a></em> loved her daughter "carefully" once she saw that Kasia was going to be pretty and intelligent and therefore most likely to be taken away the wizard called the Dragon. Wensa also sent Kasia on exhausting walks to other villages to learn how to bake, sew, etc fit for a lord's mistress and set her to frightening tasks to make her braver. When Kasia was <em>not</em> picked, the return home was therefore rather awkward, but Wensa is still distraught enough to go all the way to the Dragon's tower and beg Agnieszka's help when Kasia is abducted by the Wood. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At the end, Kasia elects to remain with the royal children for a while.

<ul><li> Miryem's father is a good and kind man who loves his family and does everything he can to ease their burdens—but it's his kindness and generosity that gives him difficulties, because he's a Jewish moneylender in a severely antisemetic town and he's too easily put off by the cheap excuses his neighbors give him to not pay what they legally owe him. This puts them into poverty and endangers her mother's life when she gets sick during a very bad winter, which drives Miryem to start collecting debts herself.
</li><li> Irina's father, the Duke of Visnya. He is a hard but entirely pragmatic and competent ruler. However, that hard pragmatism has him view Irina largely as a waste of resources once he has two sons, because he's not wealthy enough to give her a large dowry (thus marrying her advantageously) and she's too plain-looking to woo any young men of powerful families without one. When he does see a way to marry her to the tsar, she knows that he views giving her a bad husband the same way he views having to go to war to become a duke—it was difficult and unpleasant, and he won't spare her when he didn't spare himself. When she uses her position as tsarina to start making clever political decisions and plans to end the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndlessWinter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndlessWinter">Endless Winter</a>, the duke starts speaking to her the way he does anyone else he respects.

Jess notes at one point that they clearly have her best interests at heart, they just have no idea what those interests actually are—and she finds it hard to hold that against them, because most of the time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEeyore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEeyore">she can't even figure out herself what actually would make her happy.</a>

<ul><li> Catelyn Stark has to leave Winterfell to find those responsible for the crippling and attempted assassination on her younger son, Bran. She stayed with Robb, when the War of the Five Kings broke out, to help him rescue Sansa and Arya, leaving Bran and Rickon in Winterfell, which is later invaded by the Ironborn and sacked by Ramsey Snow. While Catelyn loves her children, her desire to protect and save them led to dire consequences which resulted to the downfall of her family.
</li><li> Doran Martell is not as much of a good parent as his brother, Oberyn. He even sent his eldest son, Quentyn, to a rival house due to Oberyn's mishap with its lord, causing his wife to leave him. His daughter, Arianne, noted that he doesn't mind that she lost her virginity at a young age and arranges marriages to very old people, which made her think that he's going to pass her inheritance to Quentyn, and all the important duties at Sunspear are done by Oberyn rather than her despite being the heir. But it turns out that Doran really cared about his family except that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's too caught up in wanting to avenge the brutal deaths of his sister, niece and nephew and paranoid in not telling his plans to Arianne and his brother's bastard daughters.

When she heard that her husband Jon planned to take Robert away, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she poisoned him with help from her childhood friend and crush, Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish. Unfortunately, Littlefinger is only manipulating her to sow distrust between the Starks and the Lannisters. He later admits to Lysa, before he murders her, that he loved her sister Catelyn. As of <em>A Feast Of Crows</em>, poor Robert is under the care of Littlefinger, who is using him to further his plans</span>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Room" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Room">Room</a></em>, Jack's Ma loves him unconditionally, but she suffers from severe PTSD from her time being held prisoner against her will by Old Nick. At times, she temporarily snaps and loses her temper with Jack. She wants to get her old life back but Jack wants to cling to her and their pre-escape lives, causing disagreement.

Her father is a workaholic who doesn't have much time for her, and both of her parents are more than a little overzealous in their crusade to find a cure for her diabetes. It doesn't help that she's an only child. When her parents get divorced midway through the series, their Parents As People status gets turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> because the split is so acrimonious.
<ul><li> Mary Anne's father just wants the best for her, but this translates to him being extremely overprotective, especially in the first few books where he tries to dictate virtually every aspect of her life, including what she wears, how she does her hair, and what's on her bedroom walls. He gets a bit of a wake-up call in the fourth book and starts loosening up on the little things, but still has his moments on bigger things throughout the series.
</li><li> Mallory's parents aren't as bad as Mary Anne's father, but they also seem to forget at times that Mallory is growing up, and they also sometimes over-rely on her to help manage her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveNumberedSiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveNumberedSiblings">large family</a>. However, they're usually receptive when she raises the issues with them.
</li><li> On the opposite side of the coin, Dawn's mother is very scatterbrained and forgetful. Usually it only affects her, but there are times that it causes some minor inconvenience for Dawn and her brother (like not having milk for their cereal because she forgot to buy it), and in some cases Dawn herself has to be the one who's responsible to make sure important things get done.
</li><li> Some of the BSC's clients have this, or at least start out as this, as well: for instance, Mrs. Arnold doesn't recognize that her twins are tired of not being seen as individuals (though, like Mallory's parents, she does listen when they raise the issue directly), Danielle Roberts' parents don't take her questionable antics seriously until one actually crosses the line into dangerous (fortunately, no one is seriously hurt), and Rosie Wilder's parents don't realize that their attempts to "nurture" their daughter's talents are actually over-stressing her, just to name a few.

It's pointed out in a later episode that when she was a baby he was an <em>exceptionally</em> good parent. His flaws didn't manifest until she reached school age and he had to find other things to fill his time.
</li><li> Barney's single mother Loretta slept around, constantly lied to him, refused to tell him or his half-brother who their fathers were, and was generally neglectful throughout his childhood. However, she's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">Mama Bear</a> who dearly loves Barney and him her, and in "Cleaning House" she confesses that she only ever lied to him to protect his feelings, including about his biological father.

They do love their daughter, who is terminally ill; but have no qualms in taking advantage of her illness for their own ends (Graham wanting money, Jan wanting to meet her favourite pop star.) When the pop star dies while blowing up a balloon for their daughter's birthday, they spend most of the episode ignoring her, instead preferring to argue with the singer's staff over who owns the balloon; which contains his literal last breath and as such is worth a lot of money.
</li><li> Devin's parents in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKicks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKicks">The Kicks</a></em> aren't perfect, but they do their best and are generally pretty on top of things.
</li><li> Martin Crane in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em> is a down-to-earth, likable and friendly guy, especially when compared with his uptight, snobby sons, so it's easy to see why people tend to get on better with him and take his side in the tension he has with Frasier and Niles. But it's made pretty clear, and Martin himself at times concedes, that he has as much if not more responsibility as they do for the difficult relationship he has with them. While he clearly does love them, he appears to have been a rather distant parent who was largely uninterested in the more esoteric and refined interests of his sons and didn't make a lot of effort to bond with them. He tends to take other people's sides in arguments against them (including bullies) and appears to have spent more time at his favourite bar than bonding with them, something he later comes to regret.
<div class="indent"><strong>Martin:</strong> Maybe if I'd spent less time at Duke's and more time with you guys, I wouldn't be sitting opposite a son who places so much stock in one beer.
</div><ul><li> Hester Crane, Martin's wife and Frasier and Niles's mother, gets this somewhat less because she's deceased by the events of the series and all three choose to abide by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSpeakIllOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSpeakIllOfTheDead">Never Speak Ill of the Dead</a>. Nevertheless, while she was a loving mother and wife to her family, she had feet of clay as well; she had a brief affair at one point, her overly clinical and psychological method of parenting appears to have directly resulted in a lot of Frasier and Niles's neuroses, and she appears to have been actively hostile to a lot of the women her sons chose to date.
</li><li> This was demonstrated in vivid detail in her lone appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers">Cheers</a></em>, in which she threatened to shoot Diane.
</li></ul></li><li> Another cop example is Inspector Brackenreid in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurdochMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurdochMysteries">Murdoch Mysteries</a></em>. When his youngest son Bobby is kidnapped, he laments his failure to spend adequate time bonding with him, partly blaming his career, and resolves to put things right when Bobby is found.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadLikeMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadLikeMe">Dead Like Me</a></em> strongly focuses on this trope for the Lass family, particularly Joy. She's selfish, judgmental, narrow-minded, and completely breaks down when things don't go her way, but she's also trying to cope with a huge amount of grief and stress after what is implied to be years of putting in efforts for her family that went unappreciated.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGeorgeLopezShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGeorgeLopezShow">The George Lopez Show</a></em>: Several examples.
<ul><li> Benny neglected and mistreated George. But in her defense, her husband abandoned her to live with George, and while did have some moments of kindness toward George, her own parents were downright merciless to her.
</li><li> George himself works to provide for kids, but often can give them the wrong advice, and can play favorites with Max.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RebeldeWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RebeldeWay">Rebelde Way</a></em> the three main parents exemplify this. While Sergio is absolutely abusive towards Pablo, Sonia and Franco instead are presented as doting parents who would do anything for their daughters, Mia and Marizza, even to the point of spoiling them. Yet they're also shown to have flaws in their parenting: the girls at times act a little too bratty due to their parenting; Sonia has difficulty connecting to Marizza who feels overshadowed by her, and Franco has kept Mia wrapped in a figurative plastic bubble that shields her from the reality surrounding her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Not to mention that when the two discover the parentage of their missing parents, the girls naturally freak out.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCrown2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCrown2016">The Crown (2016)</a></em>:
<ul><li> George and Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon are portrayed as loving parents but still possessing many faults. They follow advice that Elizabeth only needs schooling in areas directly related to the monarchy, leaving her entirely unprepared with a broad range of subjects when she took the crown. Her younger sister Margaret ended up feeling like a lesser sister than Elizabeth and as a result, acted out for attention, though she believed that George <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalFavouritism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalFavouritism">loved Margaret better</a> than Elizabeth.
</li><li> Elizabeth and Phillip, especially in the second season. Though both love their children, Elizabeth's job as queen keeps her unavailable to them. She is also becoming distant with Charles as he is a constant reminder of the representation of the Crown and of her own mortality. Likewise, Phillip is disappointed in Charles' sensitive nature and attempts to toughen up his son by sending him to a notoriously tough boarding school. He also at times feels outranked by Charles, who is his wife's successor.
</li></ul></li><li> Britta has to deal with this in season 6 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em>, when her friends meet the parents she's always described as repressive autocrats and find them to be lovely people who admit they weren't great at raising her, but go on to lend her thousands of dollars via her friends in an effort to look out for a daughter who refuses to have anything to do with them.
<div class="indent"><strong>Frankie:</strong> One of the most unfair lessons we're forced to learn is that our parents are human beings. We want to think of them as gods — or demons, because then that would make us heroes — but ugh, gimme a break, we all suck.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KimsConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KimsConvenience">Kim's Convenience</a></em> has a lot of focus on the parents of the Korean-Canadian immigrant Kim family interacting with their children. Mr. and Mrs. Kim (Appa and Umma) love their children Jung and Janet, but often butt heads with them due to cultural differences. This includes Umma meddlinh with their love lives and (in Janet's case) nagging for grandkids and Appa dismissing Janet's opinions/decisions due to his traditionalist views. Appa also kicked Jung (who was doing mild juvenile crime at the time) out of the house many years ago after catching him stealing money from the family store; this lead to both the parents coddling Janet more than she would like them to and also Appa and Jung avoiding each other ever since. It's revealed that Appa is very conflicted about his son — he <em>does</em> want to see him again and has fond memories of him, but he just can't let the resentment go, even though Jung has straightened himself out. Umma regularly contacts Jung but also often obsesses over his delinquent past, which Jung calls her out on. The family frequently address these issues and make progress of sorts with each other as the series goes on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SchittsCreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SchittsCreek">Schitt's Creek</a></em>: Johnny and Moira were too busy globetrotting and enjoying their wealth to be active parents to their kids, but when they move to Schitt's Creek they are forced to connect with their adult kids without the money as a crutch.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOtherTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOtherTwo">The Other Two</a></em>: Pat Dubek is genuinely enjoying the perks of her 13-year-old son becoming a star, after what is implied to have been a difficult life back in Ohio. She appears on talk shows, goes to parties and writes a children's book.
</li><li> Norma Bates in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BatesMotel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BatesMotel">Bates Motel</a></em>, as opposed to her depiction in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Psycho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Psycho">Psycho</a></em> where she was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parent</a>, is a mother who makes a lot of bad decisions, especially in regards to her son Norman. She's controlling, tries to get Norman to do activities with her, acts passive-aggressive and guilt trips a ton when Norman isn't interested, acts jealous and petty when Norman shows interest in other women, and most damaging of all, when Norman shows signs of mental problems she refuses to get him treatment. The thing is though, she does this all because she really loves Norman, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestSubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestSubtext">but not in the way a mother should love her son</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HerculesTheLegendaryJourneys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HerculesTheLegendaryJourneys">Hercules: The Legendary Journeys</a></em> frequently made a point of showing that those of great significance can make imperfect parents.
<ul><li> The top example is the king of the Olympians himself. Zeus is regularly portrayed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DotingParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DotingParent">Doting Parent</a> that dearly loves his son and protects him from his worst enemies on Olympus, but he was never around when Hercules was growing up. He's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan">Dirty Old Man</a> who prefers chasing mortal women and having fun to doing his job; one such incident gave Hera the opening to kill Herc's wife and children. Every encounter between father and son references these items in some way, with Hercules wanting to embrace his father but also resenting their history and how he has to clean up messes that the old man causes.
<ul><li> Conversely, Alcmene was shown to be the perfect parent: always around, always beaming with pride, etc. Zeus himself acknowledged that he couldn't be the father that Hercules needed, which was why Alcmene was so important.
</li></ul></li><li> As for Iolaus, his father was Skouros, a famed general who neglected the family before outright abandoning it. During one of the times he was dead, Iolaus encountered him in the Underworld, laid into him for his faults, and showed forgiveness when Skouros actually apologized for his mistakes. This actually proves very important in the long run; in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, Iolaus cites this lesson to Hercules to help him let go of his own bitterness towards Zeus. As he says, everyone is an imperfect being trying to make their way in an imperfect world.
</li><li> Aphrodite has a tense relationship with her son, Cupid. She takes her job more seriously than Zeus, but she was still content to party and think of herself most of the time. Cupid remarks he spent much of his life never even seeing her unless she had a job for him to do. She does love Cupid, but she doesn't really know how to interact with him. An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/XenaWarriorPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/XenaWarriorPrincess">Xena: Warrior Princess</a></em> has her suffer empty nest syndrome and regret not being a mother when she had the chance.
</li><li> Cupid actually had it easier than Deon, the half-mortal product of a one-night stand Aphrodite had with a fisherman. The moment Deon was born, she dropped him off at his father's house and never looked back. Hercules ends up meeting Deon and helping him with his legacy. He notes that Aphrodite has plenty of good qualities, but also a drive for fun that often hurts people.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDarkCrystalAgeOfResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDarkCrystalAgeOfResistance">The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance</a></em>: As Seladon states, Mayrin is a queen first and a mother second. She tries to impart her values to her daughters and steer them on the right path but often clashes with Brea and puts so much pressure on Seladon to follow in her footsteps. At times it's up to Tavra to keep the family together.

If allowed to explain herself, she says that she does care for Daniel and Sean and is deeply sorry for the pain she's caused them, but she's still adamant that leaving was the right thing for her to do since the alternative was a lifetime of being dead inside.
</li><li> Despite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/HeartwarmingMoments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/HeartwarmingMoments">Heartwarming Moment</a> at the end of the first game, poor Ashley Robbins suffered this between the first and second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnotherCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnotherCode">Another Code</a></em> games. While it's forgivable in that Richard still had a ton of issues to sort out after coming back into his daughter's life and his social skills probably atrophied during ten years of self-imposed isolation, the two flubbed the initial bonding effort and had to work through another game to patch things up.

After her death, this attitude <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">coupled with her forged suicide note</span> led Futaba to mistakenly believe her mother died hating her.
</li><li> Sojiro also falls under this trope. While he also deeply loves Futaba, the trauma of what happened to her mother meant that she was distant from him; for a long while, all he <em>could</em> do for her was make sure she didn't starve and fulfill any requests she made of him. The latter part of his confidant has him confess that he isn't sure he's good enough to be her father; they end up having an argument since she interprets this as him not wanting to look after her anymore, although they both reconcile.
</li><li> Ann's parents aren't abusive, but as celebrities in the fashion industry, they're often gone for months at a time due to work. Ann doesn't dislike them for it, but it contributed to her fairly lonely childhood.

It's clear that Kratos does genuinely care for Atreus but ironically his cold attitude towards Atreus is his attempt to protect Atreus from Kratos's bloody past. Kratos admits to himself that he is simply not ready to be a father figure again after the traumatic loss of his first wife and daughter and he is <em>terrified</em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">failing as a father</a> to Atreus.

While their only redeeming trait is their love for Sherry, they are obsessed with their work and often leave Sherry alone by herself. All poor Sherry wanted was for her parents to be home more. Annette manages to find Sherry in the sewers in her surveillance equipment but <em>scolds</em> Sherry for leaving the police station (even though it was overrun with zombies). And after Sherry becomes infected, Annette writes her daughter off as a lost cause and would rather leave to stop William. While her justification is that millions of lives are at risk, that was just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">cold</a> to say that to her own daughter.

In time, however, he comes around and begins to care for Jack as his son. Jack's mother, Abigail, also ran with the gang, but also wanted a better life for Jack, and was instrumental in helping John put Dutch's gang behind them.

(The stylized way they are drawn reinforces this perspective: Guardians appear as imposing silhouettes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBlank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBlank">lacking facial features</a>, seeming at once more and less than human.) As the kids undergo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and grow older</span> their perspective changes. They gain the ability to empathize with their parental figures and appreciate their virtues as well as their flaws.
<ul><li> Questions about parenthood are thrust upon the kids by the game of SBURB they play. Since it makes them participants in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreationMyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreationMyth">Creation Myth</a>, they confront the responsiblity of bringing forth new life, and even discuss the (distant) prospect of repopulating humanity the old-fashioned way. John is the first to face these challenges when (thanks to cloning) he makes a bunch of babies (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyOwnGrampa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyOwnGrampa">himself</a></span>).
</li><li> This is further explored when the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Beta kids meet the Alpha kids. Each kid comes face-to-face with an alternate version of their Guardian, but this time they are equal in age.

Their problem, however, is that their mix of insane logic and ambition for Nicole has caused them to be controlling and put too much pressure on her, unintentionally being abusive to her.
</li><li> Timmy Turner's parents, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em>, exemplify this trope. They're silly, affectionate, devoted to each other... and leave Timmy in the care of a psychotic babysitter while they're off pursuing their hobby-of-the-week. They do make earnest attempts at being good parents (and are always quick to declare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreGrounded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreGrounded">You Are Grounded</a>), but the fact is that Wanda provides the more traditional "motherly" role. In the pilot, they were unaware it was possible to hire someone to look after your children and were just sickeningly devoted to giving Timmy all their attention.
</li><li> Ray Rocket, Reggie and Otto's dad in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower">Rocket Power</a></em>, is a "cool" dad with one foot firmly in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetenceZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetenceZone">Competence Zone</a> so he falls victim to this trope occasionally.

</li><li> Arnold, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em>, is the "old before his time" result of this trope, despite living with his grandparents rather than his parents. His grandma and grandpa are of the loving-but-eccentric variety (though his grandpa can step up to the plate pretty well when called upon), which means Arnold spends a lot of time alone or with his friends.
<ul><li> In sharp contrast to Arnold's absent-minded but loving family set-up, Helga lives in the purely dysfunctional version of a family whose parents have both personalities <em>and</em> serious issues. If anything, the extensive characterization given to her parents, particularly her disillusioned and possibly-alcoholic mother, make her and her sister's situation seem even more tragic: Helga is cynical, bitchy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> and disenchanted because they pay so little attention to her, whereas Olga is a deluded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Shrinking Violet</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">Stepford Smiler</a> because they give her too <em>much</em> attention.

Real Monsters</a></em> is often described as the son of the Great Slickis. Many characters, particularly Oblina and the Gromble gush about how talented Slickis is (in stark contrast to Ickis' struggles to successfully complete his assignments.) Slickis is shown to be a very friendly, laid-back monster who is often traveling the world while he son attends a boarding school, so consequently they don't talk to each other much. The first time they try to reconnect, Slickis honestly cannot remember whether or not his son likes certain activities and Ickis gets mad because everybody else wants to hang out with Slickis, and he wants to spend the day with just his Dad. They end up going to the surface world together in an attempt to scare the humans. Ickis messes up, Slickis saves him, and then decides NOT to humiliate his son by revealing what happened after they return to the Academy. Ickis is puzzled but pleased, and the episode ends with the two monsters finally having a nice conversation. Later seasons mention Slickis, who Ickis still wants to impress, and he actually does come to watch his son win a Sewerball game (the monster version of baseball) but mostly he remains too busy with his own career to help Ickis.
</li><li> The parents of the characters on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>, especially Mr. and Mrs. Marsh, have received a surprising amount of development, even to the point of directly impacting the episodes' plots. Similarly, Kyle's mom Sheila often ends up causing more problems than she solves, both for her son and the town in general, when she starts off on one of her social crusades.
</li><li> Ron's parents in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em> could be said to fit this trope. His parents—particularly his dad—are relatively pleasant people, but show little interest in their son. They barely even include him in decisions they make which affect his life, such as moving to Norway in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> or adopting a second child. The fourth season did, however, see them become a little more involved in his life, such as the episode in which Mr. Stoppable, who is an actuary, helped bring down a villain whose power was his ability to do math.
</li><li> Parents on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em> tend to be this way. Helen is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Workaholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Workaholic">Workaholic</a> and Jake is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">Manchild</a> who can't seem to move on from his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariouslyAbusiveChildhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariouslyAbusiveChildhood">Hilariously Abusive Childhood</a>, but both clearly care for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSnarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSnarkKnight">Daria</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableLibby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableLibby">Quinn</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolLoser">Jane</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HippieParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HippieParents">Hippie Parents</a> are firm believers in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsOffParenting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsOffParenting">Hands-Off Parenting</a>, thinking that this is nurturing their kids' individuality, but don't seem to realize how dysfunctional her siblings are as a result. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtracurricularEnthusiast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtracurricularEnthusiast">Jodie</a>'s mom and dad are both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama">Education Mamas</a>, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> shows that they are willing to put that aside when they realize how stressed she has become. Et cetera.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em> parents were funny and developed, and their subplots were an important part of what made the show entertaining for adults as well as kids. However, the entire premise of the show relies on them being completely oblivious to their toddlers wandering off on dangerous adventures.
</li><li> Professor Membrane on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em> is a generally-affable and utterly brilliant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">Bunny Ears Scientist</a> who is entirely too wrapped up in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddyHadAGoodReasonForAbandoningYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddyHadAGoodReasonForAbandoningYou">fixing every problem in the world</a> to pay much attention to his children. His relationship with his son Dib is particularly strained because Dib won't get involved in "REAL Science" (he's an eleven-year-old paranormal investigator), while his daughter Gaz's desire to spend time with him is the <em>only</em> time in the series she shows a desire to be around <em>anybody.</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZimEnterTheFlorpus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZimEnterTheFlorpus">The movie</a> actually has him and Dib's relationship as its main emotional arc, showing that he's always proud of Dib even when he pursues interests that Membrane thinks are nonsense</span>.
</li><li> Jack and Maddie on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em> are sometimes more obsessed with their latest ghost-hunting activities to pay attention to their children—like, for example, to notice their son is <em>the half-ghost kid they're hunting.</em> Their older daughter Jasmine actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshades</a> this, though her diagnosis is a bit of an exaggeration—when not distracted they can show plenty of interest in their kids, often to the point of clinginess.
</li><li> Doctor Doofenschmirtz, resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em> would probably fit into this trope. After having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariouslyAbusiveChildhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariouslyAbusiveChildhood">Hilariously Abusive Childhood</a>, he's <em>very</em> dedicated to being a wonderful dad to his daughter Vanessa... except he isn't very good at it. When he isn't making the usual 'embarrassing parent' mistakes, conflicts result from the fact that he's sometimes too obsessed with his job of causing evil to care for his daughter. However, he's still overall presented as being one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodParents">Good Parents</a>, and Vanessa clearly loves him even when she's exasperated with him.

However, when it becomes clear that his daughter Jinora is much more spiritually talented than him, he ignores that due to both his pride and to avoid feeling inadequate as a spiritual mentor. He gets better after a pep talk from his student.
</li><li> Tenzin's own father Aang spent more time with Tenzin than he did with Kya or Bumi, since Tenzin was the only airbender (and thus the only one who could help revive the Air Nomad culture). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">Kya and Bumi resent Aang and Tenzin for this</a> even in the present day <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">though they get over it in the second season, and when Bumi becomes an airbender in the third season, he takes it in stride</span>.

</li><li> Toph was very "hands-off" with her daughters due to her resentment of her own parents' opposite methods. Her younger daughter Suyin resented the perceived lack of attention and acted out, resulting in her being forced to leave her home, something her older sister Lin took very badly. Suyin in turn tried to keep her own daughter Opal from seeing the world <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">though she relents in the end</span>, in a manner eerily reminiscent of her grandparents' treatment of Toph. The Bei Fong family in general seem to be prone to making mistakes in parenting despite the best of intentions.

At one point he even tries to be a better and attentive father, only for Bart and Lisa to tell him they <em>prefer</em> him being a "half-assed under-parent".
<ul><li> Marge can be considered a more mundane variant; while she's a more competent parent, she is still imperfect and sometimes vents her personal issues and overbearing nature onto her kids despite her devotion to them.

</li><li> A major theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> is that all of Steven's parental figures are, for all that he looks up to them, people, with problems and issues of their own. This is particularly true of the main maternal figure in his life, the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Team Mom</a> Pearl, who has been a neurotic wreck ever since Steven's mother Rose left her for his father Greg, with resulting projection issues and a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicBigot">distrust toward any human that isn't Steven</a>.

</li><li> Steven's father Greg is a very loving, supportive, and open-minded parent who dotes on his son as much as he can. However, due to him almost always working just to support him financially and Steven's constant training to become a Crystal Gem, they don't always see each other as much as they want. It even becomes a plot point in one episode <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> where Greg fakes an injury just so they can spend more time together</span>.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseFuture">Steven Universe: Future</a></em> dives into this further in "Mr. Universe." Much of what we hear about Greg's family presents them as stuffy and overly-conservative, which is why he lost contact with them and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShedTheFamilyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShedTheFamilyName">changed his name</a> to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolname">Universe</a>."

</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Greg:</strong> You grew up with actual <em>freedom!</em> <br/><strong>Steven:</strong> I grew up <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivesInAVan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivesInAVan">in a van</a>!</em> I never went to school!

</div></li><li> Connie's parents, Priyanka and Doug Maheswaran, began as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughLove">overly-strict</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama">Education Mamas</a>, with Priyanka especially having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">Control Freak</a> tendencies that made the poor girl terrified of her. The episode "Nightmare Hospital" has her find out about Connie's Gem-related activities and reluctantly start encouraging her to pursue them. She also decides to start mellowing out after seeing how much emotional damage her parenting techniques are causing.
</li></ul></li><li> Both Jerry and Beth of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em> often show concern for their kids and the effect Rick's antics can have on them, however they are continuously hindered by their own psychological problems and their failing marriage.
</li><li> Tino's dad in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWeekenders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWeekenders">The Weekenders</a></em> obviously cares a lot about his son but due to insecurities about being boring, fails to realize that all his son wants to do when he's visiting his dad (or his dad is visiting him) is to spend time with him and <em>just</em> him and is so upset by the latest visit that he just wants it to be over. He eventually fixes it but it takes a full-hour episode to do it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>: Fry's parents were odd individuals, with his mother being a hard-drinking sports fan and his father being a paranoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">Conspiracy Theorist</a> obsessed with the then-disbanded USSR. Though neglectful at times, the flashbacks showed that they really did love Fry and raised him as well as they were able. They even tried searching for him when he went missing.
</li><li> This is a running theme on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess">Recess</a></em>. The Gang's parents aren't depicted much, but when they are, they're far more likely to end up making a mess or admitting their own flaws rather than saving the day.
<ul><li> The trope is most commonly seen with Spinelli's parents. As the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleMissBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleMissBadass">toughest kid on the playground</a>, she frequently makes it <em>extremely</em> clear that she doesn't like cosmetics and fashion, and has a general aversion to all things "girly." Despite Spinelli repeatedly saying this, though, her parents, and especially her mom, have a tendency to baby and treat her like a little princess, which she hates.
<ul><li> In "More Like Gretchen," Spinelli recruits Gretchen to come along to a cosmetics museum, as her mother is outright forcing her to go. While there, Gretchen makes a big impression on Mrs. Spinelli with her wide array of knowledge; she does the same with Mr. Spinelli at a family dinner later. The parents are so pleased with her that they constantly wonder why Spinelli can't be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">more like Gretchen</a> <em>to their daughter's face.</em> Needless to say, this deeply hurts Spinelli's feelings.
</li></ul></li><li> Gus's father has a similar problem. A lieutenant who calls his son "cadet," he tends to look at the world through a military perspective, which, while well-intentioned, doesn't always come across as particularly wise. In one episode, he responds to Gus's question about a bully by telling a lengthy story about Belgium standing up to Germany during World War One. Gus is impressed at the idea of "little Belgium" defeating the superpower; Lieutenant Griswald then bursts out laughing, explaining that Germany absolutely <em>destroyed</em> Belgium in the war (although the action did prompt the rest of Europe to stand up to Germany, a metaphor for what happens later in the episode regarding the bully). Gus ends up feeling no better than before after hearing this "advice."
</li><li> In a more minor example, Gretchen's parents often encourage her scientific pursuits to the detriment of her friendships and other hobbies. In "My Fair Gretchen," the young genius gets a perfect score on a difficult test, prompting the school to try to send her to a academy for gifted students. Gretchen doesn't want to go, because it will separate her from her friends, but her parents won't listen (in her own words, "my mom's been turning cartwheels since I told her").
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em>: Marco's parents, Rafael and Angie. The two are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> alright, but they act so much like they're still on their honeymoon that they can be a bit neglectful of Marco at times and are oblivious to all the life-threatening adventures he goes on with Star. Despite this, they still show a lot of care for their son, like showing concern for him when he's depressed, becoming lonely when he's gone for long periods, and enjoying those moments they spend with him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017">DuckTales (2017)</a></em>: Della Duck's character arc in season 2 focuses around this trope. She spends ten years stranded far away from her family as a direct result of her own thrill-seeking. Upon her return, she wants to become a good mother to her sons Huey, Dewey, and Louie, but has <em>no</em> idea whatsoever how to go about it, acting more like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis">Cool Big Sis</a> than a mother. This results in things like letting them overload on sugary treats, telling stories that keep them up all night scared to death, or encouraging recklessness not unlike her own. She grows gradually, realizing she was encouraging Dewey the wrong way, helping Huey try to step out of his comfort zone and try new things, or laying down the law on Louie when his antics nearly get everyone lost in time. She even offers encouragement to Webby, who saw Della as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter">Always Someone Better</a>.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MissSpidersSunnyPatchFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MissSpidersSunnyPatchFriends">Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Friends</a></em>, Miss Spider and Holley aren't portrayed as perfect parents and neither are Spiderus and Spindella once they become parents. As early as "Family Circus," Miss Spider is shown making a mistake when she admits she jumped to conclusions regarding Squirt's actions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower">She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</a></em>: Out of the three parent-helmed family or family-like units we get in meaningful detail, only one isn't shown to be well-intentioned but flawed (the exception, Shadow Weaver, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">"less well-intentioned but flawed" and more "manipulative, dishonest and cruel"</a>.
<ul><li> Queen Angella means well and loves her daughter, but her overprotective streak poses something of a problem, especially since she's literally a higher being by virtue of being an immortal angel: she spends most of the first season arguing with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousPrincess">Glimmer</a>, trying to get her to be more like Angella and less like her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Disappeared Dad</a> Micah. Eventually, she comes to accept Glimmer as the person she is, rather than continually trying to reshape her, and their relationship becomes a lot better, but Glimmer keeps her insecurities, and they play a role in some of Glimmer's more foolhardy decisions in the fourth season.
</li><li> Bow's dads love him without reservation, but they've gotten it into their heads that his greatest dream is to be a historian like them, and they didn't listen when he told them otherwise. Bow has constructed an entire fake life to allow him to continue fighting with the Rebellion without disillusioning them. That being said, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FawltyTowersPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FawltyTowersPlot">after the whole thing comes crashing down</a>, they accept his choices and apologise for failing him as parents, but in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">Lotus-Eater Machine</a> that gives people some of their deepest desires to keep them quiescent - Catra gets Adora back, Glimmer's family is back together, and so on - Bow is shown as a trainee archivist, rather than the technically gifted soldier he became in the real world.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheOwlHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheOwlHouse">The Owl House</a></em>: The pilot features Luz's mother being called into the principal's office <em>again</em> since Luz accidentally released a bunch of snakes for her book report. It's implied that Luz is in real danger of being expelled, so her mom thinks the best solution is to send her daughter to Reality Check camp for three months in the hopes that it will mellow her daughter. Mrs. Noceda does love her daughter, but is shown to visibly struggle with her exceedingly hyperactive behavior and the problems it can cause. Her constant insistence at encouraging Luz to make some friends that aren't reptiles or animals shows she is also deeply concerned with her daughter's poor social interactions. Eventually, Luz decides to spend the summer in a magical dimension instead and learn to be a witch.
