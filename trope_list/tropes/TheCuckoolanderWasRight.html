Simon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">not only proves that Kamina was right all along</a>, he goes beyond even his brother's already sky-high expectations and literally becomes <em>the greatest human in history</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a></em>, two of the most insane characters actually come the closest to breaking the truth about what actually happened. Rena deduces that the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the men in the white van are after her and want to kill her. She also decrees that the men going to see Chie-sensei and tending to their garden was really suspicious.</span> Actually, this turns out to be true, as they are indeed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">out to kill the gang. The Yamainu drive around in their van and monitor their victims to take advantage of them.</span>
<ul><li> Next, in Tatarigoroshi-hen, Keiichi takes a ride with Takano and notices Tomitake's bike in the back of the car she is in, he questions her and she says it indeed belongs to him. He asks her where he is, but she turns creepy and he wisely gets away from her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He had every right to be suspicious of her. She is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>.</span>
</li><li> The one who got the closest was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">Shion Sonozaki</a> to solving the mystery behind Oyashiro-sama's curse. She correctly deduced that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tomitake was killed by a drug to make him crazy and scratch out his throat, that Rika was coming to inject her with a drug</span>, that someone was following Rena and Satoshi, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hanyuu was following them</span>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that someone wanted the bodies of Miyo Takano and Tomitake to be found, and that Takano probably faked her death. She also assumed that when she thinks of the killer, she thinks of nurses and doctors. Takano was a nurse. If she hadn't assumed the Sonozakis were behind it, she would have stopped Takano.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PandoraHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PandoraHearts">PandoraHearts</a></em>, the hyper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Lottie</a> says to Jack after he has taken over Oz's body to scare them away, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"You're so full of yourself because people call you a hero and somesuch! You must have been so glad when Glen died."</span> Later on, it turns out she was entirely right to suspect <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong">Jack.</a></span> Woo-hoo for Lottie.
</li><li> Out of all the characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh">Azumanga Daioh</a></em>, Osaka is the only one who appears to be aware that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians">Kaorin has a thing</a> for Sakaki. At one point, she's also discovered to be a <em>genius</em> at word puzzles.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em>, one of the main characters turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Mazoku.</a> Everyone expresses shock and surprise and various levels of betrayal, except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolander</a> Gourry, who says he knew it all along. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToFool">Turns out he thought it was so obvious that it didn't deserve a mention.</a>
</li><li> During <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em>, Miyako pretty much flips out over feeling nervous and starts yelling and jumping around. Her assumed reason for Ken's base disappearing is that it flew away. No one really listens to her because she is so worked up, but it actually turns out that's exactly what it did.
</li><li> At some point in the third arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em>, Walker and Erika casually decide that Simon and Dennis, the owners and staff of the local Russian Sushi restaurant that they regularly eat at, are secretly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerRegimePersonnel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerRegimePersonnel">Former Regime Personnel</a> on the run from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafiya">The Mafiya</a>. The next volume proves them <em>completely right</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ParanoiaAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ParanoiaAgent">Paranoia Agent</a></em>, that crazy guy chalking random things on the ground? The <strong>only</strong> one who truly gets what the hell really happened.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam">∀ Gundam</a></em>, Corrin Nander is quite crazy and violent besides. But he's also the only person to recognize just how dangerous the Gundam really is, having apparently survived a Gundam attack long before the series.
</li><li> A common event in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatteniKaizo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatteniKaizo">Katteni Kaizo</a></em>. For all the times the crap that comes out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Kaizo's</a> mouth has been true, you'd think the other club members would stop looking at him like a brain-damaged idiot. Of course...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaitamaChainsawShoujo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaitamaChainsawShoujo">Saitama Chainsaw Shoujo</a></em>, in a long crazy spiel, Kaoruko Odagiri says <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the new transfer student is an alien who has come to Earth to abduct the main character's ex-boyfriend</span> but given what else she was saying, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">why would anyone believe her?</a>
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman">Bakuman。</a>, the highly eccentric Nizuma is nevertheless often right about manga. When looking over works that Mashiro and Takagi, Fukuda, and Aoki and Nakai plan to submit to the Golden Future Cup, he predicts that two of them are tied for first place, but refuses to say which to avoid upsetting the one in third. He's correct, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Detective Trap and Kiyoshi Knight- Muto Ashirogi and Fukuda's work, respectively</span> are tied for first place in an unprecedented result.

In episode 4, Mahiro's mother returns home and everyone (including Mahiro himself) learns that she's a part-time deity hunter who's also deadly with forks. When this is revealed, even Nyarko is shocked, since by her own admission her earlier remark was just an off-the-cuff joke and not meant to be any serious speculation.
<ul><li> It actually happens semi-regularly in this series, most often with Nyarko trying to identify the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Gun</a> that will turn out to be the lynchpin of the current crisis. Mahiro almost always dismisses her suggestions because they would make for a really stupid resolution...and he gets really ticked off when she's right. There was even one incident where Nyarko dismissed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail">her own suggestion</a> as being way too contrived, so naturally she was 100% correct.

However, Judai wasn't able to see them (although he tried to keep open-minded) and Manjyome was downright rude to her about it, calling her insane (You might be able to chalk a lot of that up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">the fact he was brainwashed at the time</a>). However, after Judai finally won the duel, he finally <em>was</em> able to see one of the spirits she was speaking of.

Nevertheless the members of the Endless family tend to embody not only what their names might suggest (dying, despairing, destroying) but also the opposite (being born, hoping, re-/creating).

Delirium is capable of becoming sane at will, but it causes her great pain to do so.

The same thing happens when they return to Equestria at the end of the movie and Twilight gets teased for possibly having a crush on one of the castle guards, with Pony Pinkie summarizing the movie's romance subplot by guessing said guard is the pony counterpart to the human guitarist Twilight actually developed feelings for during the film.

Everyone expects this to be Hagrid's greatest folly but it turns out that Hagrid's crude attempts at teaching his brother English and civilizing him actually work.
</li><li> Also from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>, Sybill Trelawney is an amiable lunatic who everyone thinks is a complete fraud... until she issues two True Prophecies that affect the plot of the entire series. She actually predicts a lot of minor stuff, but she seems so much of a fraud that nobody seems to take her words for any merit; probably because she has the habit of hopelessly misinterpreting the actual omens she sees. It's heavily implied that she <em>has</em> the gift, passed down from previous generations, but just can't <em>control</em> it, making her most genuine prophecies in a trance-like state that she doesn't remember afterward.
<ul><li> In book 3 Trelawney predicts that Harry will DIE. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> ...And she is absolutely right - she's just four books early.</span> Moreover, every prediction she makes in the opening fusillade of her first class does, eventually, come true in some capacity.
</li><li> Or, taken another way, she specifically sees Harry encounter the Grim, a specter of death that takes the form of a large black dog. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Her vision was much more literal than even she expected: Harry does, in fact, have a very significant encounter with a large black dog (which resembles, but is not, the Grim) by the end of the year.</span>
</li><li> It can't help that one of the few times she's right even she doesn't believe it: in HBP when she's reading cards and draws the Knave of Spades<em> "a dark young man, possibly troubled, one who dislikes the questioner" </em> just as she's standing next to Harry's hiding spot, only to decide that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacePalm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacePalm">couldn't possibly be right</a>. She might actually have some talent <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">aside from the two Voldemort related prophecies she doesn't remember</span> but is simply unable to differentiate it from her desperate guessing since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWereTryingTooHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWereTryingTooHard">she wants it so much</a>.

As the Dalek mothership explodes around them, the Doctor ushers all of his companions into the TARDIS to escape, including extending an invitation to Davros, offering to save him. Davros refuses, and stays to go down with the ship, and it is at this moment that Caan laughs maniacally and repeats the prophecy that "one will still die". The Doctor's invitation to Davros could be seen as promoting Davros to companion, albeit briefly, and thus Davros' death fulfils the prophecy.

<ul><li> The closest example to the spirit of the trope is possibly <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gunther's ridiculous claims that the vending machine maintenance man is plotting against him</span>. Which <em>Invisible War</em> confirms to be <em>true</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheNamelessMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheNamelessMod">The Nameless Mod</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">discusses</a> this premise in the fan fiction shop, and has this <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> from a hobo you encounter in Forum City, who mentions that he saw aliens abduct Deus Diablo.</span>

Right when you assume she's projecting on the poor little thing, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the turtle starts talking. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalDissonance">In a deep, sexy voice</a>, it outlines a plan you must follow to advance further in the game</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VampireTheMasqueradeBloodlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VampireTheMasqueradeBloodlines"> Vampire: The Masquerade  Bloodlines</a></em>:
<ul><li> Rosa the Thin-Blood will frequently descend into long and nonsensical speeches about such things as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostShip">The Crimson Ship</a>" or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowledgeBroker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowledgeBroker">The Voice In The Darkness</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catchphrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catchphrase">Boss</a>." And, of course, as the game slowly progresses, Rosa's prophesies start to come true. It is implied that she is a Malkavian Thin-Blood. Because she is a Thin-Blood, she manages to stave off madness much of the time and remain mostly sane. Because she is a Malkavian, during the times when she <em>does</em> descend into madness what she says usually means more than it might seem at first glance.
</li><li> A Malkavian protagonist will have quite a few moments like this, too, often <em>casually</em> dropping atomic-bomb scale foreshadowing and revelations into dialog. It looks like a Malkavian PC is just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkativeLoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkativeLoon">Talkative Loon</a>, but almost everything he says has a hidden or double meaning. Emphasis on almost, granted...
</li><li> In both cases, however, neither of the characters actually <em>understand</em> what they are talking about: They merely see glimpses of things without the necessary context to comprehend it. An example is when the Malkavian encounters Ming Xiao <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNicknamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNicknamer">and refers to her as "The Mistress of Mirrors"</a>, which angers her. She is a shapeshifter (thus 'reflecting' others), but the Malkavian doesn't know that.

The Utwig claims it gives them magical powers and guidance, while every other race think it's a useless piece of junk and the Utwig were ripped off. However, all of the advice the Ultron supposedly gives them turns out to be important, including giving the Druuge useless artifacts as payment for the Ultron instead of the Precursor Bomb they were trying to obtain, and (when you repair it in a bid to gain their alliance) attacking only the Kohr-Ah <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and subsequently delaying their victory in the Doctrinal War</span>. Having Commander Hayes examine the repaired Ultron reveals that it's actually a Precursor device which only affects certain races, so perhaps the Utwig were onto something when they bought it.

WAY later on in the game the team learns that his doomsday rants are more accurate than you originally thought. The accuracy of his rambling has lead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation">some fans to theorize</a> that Manuel might have <em>also</em> glimpsed the Prothean beacon's message and his mind was destroyed, as Liara suggested might happen to someone who, unlike Shepard, lacked the extraordinary willpower to handle it.
<ul><li> A Dr. Manuel Cayce appears in the second game during the Firewalker missions, where Shepard investigates a series of planets in the Hammerhead. These planets detail a Dr. Manuel's search for evidence of Reaper invasion including text documents showing his growing paranoia over whether his associate had become indoctrinated (Dr. Manuel decides to make sure and kills him) and leads the player to a huge floating Prothean sphere artifact that shrinks down to the size of a bowling ball when touched.

In fact, she's the ONLY one who knows, due to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory">excluded from a bout of reality-alteration</a> that made everybody else in the world forget.

Much of what he says is nonsense, but there's always a glimmer of truth in there, and the information you can dig out of his ramblings will help you complete several quests in town. After completing the quest "Come Fly with Me", No-Bark can be heard being interviewed on Radio New Vegas, where he... simply recaps the events of the quest without any crazy rambling, but because it sounds just as crazy <em>as</em> his crazy rambling, it's dismissed. Also, there's the fact that the "interview" was actually just him yelling at a teddy bear, and one of RNV's microphones just happened to record it by accident.

When asked to come along, Ulstyr nods and starts rattling off random phrases which seem like nonsense, but Chance becomes nervous when they eventually start coming true, wondering if the tales about the insane communing with Sheogorath, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod">Daedric Prince of Madness</a> were actually true, and if he was feeding Ulstyr information. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He was</span>.

Protagonist and self-proclaimed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> Kyouma Hououin (birth name: Okabe Rintarou) sees conspiracy in everything, blaming even minor, everyday inconveniences on the shadowy machinations of the world-spanning Organization, but since he's pretty much harmless, those around him just let it slide. So when he starts raving that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalCounterpart">SERN</a> has been researching <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> with the ultimate goal of enslaving humanity, and that his microwave is the only thing that can stop them...

<ul><li> Anghel Higure is a bird who's... not quite right in the head. Just for starters, he's convinced that he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel">Fallen Angel</a> and the heroine is his reincarnated love Edel Blau, regularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicEntry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicEntry">crashes through glass windows</a> and loudly proclaims that he can sense demon spores that must be eradicated at once, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">treats even the most pedestrian decisions as life-and-death matters</a>. However, in the Bad Boys Love route, it turns out that at least one part of his ramblings actually has validity to it: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the "demon spores" he keeps on ranting about and senses the most strongly in the infirmary were most likely the Charon virus Doctor Shuu was preparing to infect Ryouta with in the same infirmary, which indicates that he can actually sense diseases/viruses that no one else can</span>.
</li><li> There's a scene where Anghel can talk to Nageki Fujishiro, who is baffled. Partly because Anghel is... being Anghel, but also because he's talking about things <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> from before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostAmnesia">Nageki's death</a> five years ago</span> that he should have no way of knowing. It goes far beyond this, in fact: After you've completed Bad Boy's Love, going back to the regular routes and listening to Anghel again will leave you with <a class="urllink" href="http://lexlee20.tumblr.com/post/23616979639/omg-himnesia">the mind-blasting realization<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that everything he says, which once came off as complete nonsense, describes the events of that plot <em>perfectly,</em> leaving you with the impression that perhaps Anghel is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">only sane bird</a> at St. Pigeonation's.
</li></ul></li><li> Throughout the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ZeroEscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ZeroEscape">Zero Escape</a></em> series the protagonists will be <em>bombarded</em> with conspiracy theory, parapsychology, obscure philosophy, and occultism.

Their actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> accuracy rate is about 75% — and even when one of their theories is completely wrong it still hints at the truth.

<ul><li> Michiru is the one who manages to guess (on pure gut instinct) the true nature of Yuuji's occupation <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">suspecting him to be somekind of spy or terrorist, which considering that he works as an agent for a secret government organization, is not far off the mark.</span>

At the start of Chapter 4, he predicts no more murders will occur. This being only halfway through the game, the characters (and the audience) doubt that, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he is right in that there are no more homicides. Sakura's death was a suicide. Mukuro's murder had happened weeks earlier. Makoto survives his execution and the mastermind willingly executes herself.</span>
<ul><li> And if that prediction was wrong, he also predicts that he and Makato's children will have the same mother. In the bad ending, that is exactly what happens.

Time isn't made out of lines. It is made out of circles. That is why clocks are round." which actually fits with the eventual series theme of events going in circles, including a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a>.
</li><li> In season 8, Doc, Agent Washington, and the Meta are heading to Sidewinder to track down Church. Wash stops the jeep, and notes that there might be a trap waiting, one set up by a freelancer. Doc suggests that Wash noticing the trap might be part of the trap, but Wash assures him that he's overthinking things. Then it turns out that they stopped the jeep in the center of a circle of proximity mines. Doc manages to say, "Told you so" just before the kaboom.

</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "Bart's Comet", when Springfield is threatened by a comet, the only one not panicking is Homer. He's convinced it will burn up in the atmosphere and be "no bigger than a Chihuahua's head". At the end of the episode, that's exactly what happens (it even lands next to a Chihuahua for comparison).
<div class="indent"><strong>Bart:</strong> But what's really amazing, is that this is exactly what Dad said would happen. <br/><strong>Lisa:</strong> Yeah, Dad was right... <br/><strong>Homer:</strong> I know kids, I'm scared too!" <em>[family hugs, terrified]</em>
</div></li><li> In "Brother's Little Helper", Bart, when his ADD medicine caused him to become paranoid. He became convinced that Major League Baseball was using a satellite to spy on the populace, and stole a tank to shoot it down. Mark McGwire, fresh off of his pursuit of the home run record, immediately showed up to distract everybody's attention.
</li><li> In "Homerazzi", when the family put their valuables in a fire-proof safe, we see Bart's Krusty doll falling on Lisa's Malibu Stacy convertible turning its headlights on lighting Homer's cologne bottle causing it to boil and explode. When they see the safe smoking, Homer guesses exactly everything we've seen, but Lisa denies it as ridiculous...until the safe explodes.
</li><li> Marge briefly becomes paranoid in "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad Marge", thinking that Becky is planning to kill her and steal Homer, but every accusation she makes is debunked and everyone thinks she's crazy. At the end, however, when she finally concedes she was wrong and apologizes to Becky, Becky confesses and says she <em>had</em> been planning to kill her, at least originally. (According to her, she had a lot of trouble buying a shovel and decided to scrap the whole idea.)
</li><li> "Lisa's Rival" features a subplot where Homer starts obsessively guarding a pile of sugar from thieves. Marge tries to tell him that he's being paranoid...at which Homer promptly discovers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishStuffiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishStuffiness">stereotypical British gentleman</a> hiding inside the sugar pile, who explains that he stole the sugar for his tea, "when you let your guard down for that split second, and I'd do it again."
</li><li> Played around in "The Springfield Files": Homer is convinced he saw an alien in the woods, but everybody else thinks he's off his rocker (even Mulder and Scully). At the end of the episode, Homer is proven right, or more like half-right — There <em>was</em> a strange sight on the woods, but turns out that it was the result of Mr. Burns' weekly treatments.
</li></ul></li><li> This is periodically the case with Sticks in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom">Sonic Boom</a></em>. Sticks is a feral badger with <em>wildly</em> out-of-control paranoid delusions, that regularly turn out to be entirely correct: for example, the second episode has her not only realise that Eggman is up to something when he asks to crash with Sonic and Tails for a few days, but <em>accurately guess the name of the murder-robot he plans to use</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the "Imaginationland" three-parter, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelGibson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelGibson">Mel Gibson</a>, over the course of a masochistic rant, suggests to government agents that they look over the individuals in a terrorist video, looking for someone who 'doesn't fit,' which turns out to be the hint they needed. Different from most of these cases because the agents instantly recognize it as such. "Say what you want about Mel Gibson, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">the son of a bitch knows story structure!</a>"
</li><li> In "Reverse Cowgirl" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Butters admits he thought the correct way to sit on the toilet was to sit inward so you can rest your reading material on the top and reach the handle without having to look down. Near the end John Harrington's ghost confirms that this is how he intended it to be used</span>.
</li><li> In "Douche and Turd" the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalWrongsGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalWrongsGroup">PETA</a> leader was a batshit crazy zoophiliac, but he still gave Stan sound (well, as sound as it gets in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">South Park</a>) advice about having to accept choosing between between a giant douche and a turd sandwich for a school mascot, because douches and turds are the only kinds of people that succeed in politics and become nominees, and it will always be the only choice he ever gets, so he might as well get used to it. This particularly stands out as he was the only authority figure who didn't act in outrage to Stan's apathy to voting (compared to the adults of South Park, who compared to their awareness of PETA being insane, had Stan <em>banished</em> from the town).
</li><li> Cartman becomes the Cloudcuckoolander in "Die Hippie Die" when he warns the town of an oncoming hippie music festival and is imprisoning hippies in his basement, leading to him being thrown in jail - until the festival begins consuming the town and everyone has to turn to Cartman to get rid of all the hippies.
</li><li> In "Volcano", Cartman tells a story about Scuzzlebutt, a monster with a stalk of celery for an arm and Patrick Duffy for a leg, and who weaves wicker baskets at night. The other boys ridicule his stupid monster story right up until Scuzzlebutt appears in the end.
</li><li> In "Time to Get Cereal", Al Gore is vindicated after it turns out that ManBearPig is a very real threat that is actively causing mayhem. Gore himself does not hesitate to rub it in the boys' face that they shouldn't have mocked him in the past, even while he helps them in finding out how to deal with ManBearPig.

</li><li> Rose Quartz started a war to defend Earth, and many gems that fought in it (on Homeworld's side, anyway) are still alive. Despite this, Fluorite, one of the Off-Colors (Homeworld Gems who are persecuted because they don't fall into line), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EskimosArentReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EskimosArentReal">doesn't think that Rose Quartz existed</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And while Rose Quartz <em>gems</em> did indeed exist, the Rose Quartz everyone is thinking of did <em>not</em>.

He wanted Stroker to investigate. Stroker accepts the money, and walks off.

<ul><li> Happens fairly often in mathematics and science. Quantum mechanics is surely Cloud Cuckoo Land material, and it's been proven correct at every test. Relativity is similar, if a LITTLE easier to understand.
<ul><li> Dr. Michio Kaku famously said "It is often stated that of all the theories proposed in this century, the silliest is quantum theory. In fact, some say that the only thing that quantum theory has going for it is that it is unquestionably correct."
</li><li> Niels Bohr: "If quantum mechanics hasn't profoundly shocked you, you haven't understood it yet."
</li><li> Also Niels Bohr: "We are all agreed that [quantum theory] is crazy. What divides us is whether it is crazy enough to have a chance of being correct."

Of course, there are also many, many errors, but it's still pretty impressive.

</li><li> People often make fun of conspiracy theorists who think the government is watching everyone, but revelations from leaked files about global surveillance programs show those conspiracy theorists are more right than many would like.

But a small but non-negligible percentage of the stories they've researched actually turn out to be <em>true</em>. A prime example is <a class="urllink" href="http://www.snopes.com/medical/asylum/fbipizza.asp">this story of FBI agents trying to order pizza in an insane asylum<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> sounds like a joke, but to their astonishment it was confirmed by the FBI.
