</div></div><p>In order for a relationship to work, each party must put effort into the relationship, and they must appreciate the results. Sometimes, one party has to put more effort in than the other, while in other situations, it's evenly spread. Of course, it can also become a very sick relationship when it's All Take And No Give. This trope comes in two flavors with a middle ground.

These relationships are typically led by a domineering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint">Bratty Half-Pint</a>, a more sinister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyForbiddingFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyForbiddingFather">Fantasy-Forbidding Father</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">Clingy Jealous Girl</a> over an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">Extreme Doormat</a>.
</p><p>The other variant is a bit more disturbing. Rather than the Taker being in charge, it's the Giver who is in control. It's not that they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">pathologically compelled</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodSamaritan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodSamaritan">generosity</a>, but a deep desire to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">control</a> and even <em>own</em> the Taker... so they work to make them completely psychologically and physically dependent, and may, in fact, cripple their ability to do some (or all) things.

Expect them to say "I did it all for you", and justify alienating the Taker from past friends because "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWereHoldingYouBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWereHoldingYouBack">They Were Holding You Back</a>." If the Taker should realize this and work up the resolve to break the cycle, the Giver <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">will not be pleased</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Monster">Another Monster</a></em> delves deeper into Tenma and Eva's relationship, when Eva realizes that, despite her being the taker, Tenma was always the stronger one that she depended on for a sense of worth and confidence.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpiritedAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpiritedAway">Spirited Away</a></em>, we have a case of the second variant with No Face as the Giver and Chihiro as the Taker. In the beginning, No Face helped Chihiro out and Chihiro gratefully accepted his help. But once Chihiro refused to accept one of his gifts after seeing how the other bath patrons were greedily accepting his gifts of gold without question, No Face <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">went a little crazy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">ate some people</a> and demanded that Chihiro be brought to him so she could accept his gifts.
<ul><li> Then there's Yubaba and her gigantic baby Boh. She coddles him incessantly and he's spoiled rotten. It takes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph">Baleful Polymorph</a> into a tiny animal for him to learn manners and "grow up". He gets better.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Pretear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Pretear">Prétear</a></em>: Takako, when she first started out as the Pretear, was the Taker, with Hayate as the Giver. However, when she realized that he didn't return her affections, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouEvil">she became the Princess of Disaster.</a>
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> has Lelouch masterfully manipulating Rolo into being a Giver. Poor Rolo thought someone actually liked him. Of course, being both a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">fake replacement sibling</a> <em>and</em> an assassin ordered to kill Lelouch if he was shown to have his memories regained did not endear him. Also, Rolo had become the manipulative type of Giver, to the point he wanted Lelouch as his brother to the point where he would forget Nunnally. And once <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rolo killed Shirley in cold blood</span>, Lelouch pretty much tried to get rid of him as payback. Until, ironically enough, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rolo saved his life <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath">at the cost of his own</a></span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> plays with this. Yugi solves the Millennium Puzzle and gains a spirit for an alter ego. The spirit then protects Yugi from bullies and wins games of all kinds on his behalf, including tournaments, whilst letting Yugi take credit. Initially, Yugi refuses to entertain the idea of helping the spirit get his freedom, but he later admits his dependency and resolves to become stronger. Zigzagged in that most of the reason the pair entered tournaments in the first place was people targeting the Puzzle and Yugi's loved ones, rather than Yugi using the spirit intentionally for personal glory. The final arc partially focuses on Yugi asserting his own strength and learning to live up to the reputation the spirit gave him, netting a big victory against one of the final villain's forms and challenging the spirit to a final duel after the day has been saved.
</li><li> Unsui and Agon of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em> have this undertone to their relationship. Unsui tends to act like a surrogate parent to his brother (it's implied their real parents spoil him), puts his brother's needs before his own, and constantly apologizes for his brother's actions. This is due to Unsui's need to have a purpose after the painful realization that he'll always be a mediocre person without his brother.
</li><li> Ui and Yui of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn">K-On!</a></em> play this for laughs. Despite being older, Yui has a child-like dependence on her little sister who acts like a doting mother to her immature sister.
</li><li> This is what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ajimu</span> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox">Medaka Box</a></em> says is the true nature of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Medaka and Zenkichi</span>'s relationship. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Even after Zenkichi's unfailing devotion to her, all out of his love for her, she takes it for granted. Ajimu bluntly states he was not born to serve Medaka.</span> This ultimately proves to have some truth to it when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Medaka berates and attacks Zenkichi for not being able to pass the first part of her test given to her possible successors. When Zenkichi confronts her to prove his point, she beats the tar out of him and berates him further to solidify him becoming her enemy just so she wasn't wrong in her assumptions can continue to see value in him</span>.
<ul><li> This also makes her seem even more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> since when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Akune decides to join Zenkichi against Medaka she praises him instead of giving him the same treatment</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Partway through <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WelcomeToTheNHK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WelcomeToTheNHK">Welcome to the N.H.K.</a></em>, Satou begins to fear/hallucinate that Misaki may be trying to trick him into a relationship. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She is.</span>
</li><li> A relationship becomes the motive for murder in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>. The "Taker" discovered that the "Giver" was ruining her life so she'd stay dependent forever, and thus murdered the "Giver".
</li><li> At the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu">Princess Tutu</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ojou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ojou">Rue</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessBoy">Mytho</a> have a strange relationship where they're both content but they both "give" things that the other person finds meaningless and "take" something else that's unimportant to the other; Rue might be considered the Taker just because she gets <em>something</em> out of Mytho that he intentionally gives, even if it's not what she really wants. Mytho follows Rue's every whim, but only because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">he likes being ordered around</a> and "nobody else tells [him] what to do". Rue keeps him around because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">she wants to be loved</a>, but he's completely incapable of reciprocating, so she just makes him tell her "I love you" and pretends that it's real.

This results in a relationship where Light plays with her life, like everyone else's, while she is gradually consumed by her obsession with him, despite his total lack of affection toward her. It culminates in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">her death</a></span>.

During this period, Light is genuinely trying to help, and L gladly accepts his generosity - while trying to get him convicted for murder.

Tom is extremely annoyed at all the fuss being made over it. (He smartens up after a particularly wild night sends him into a nearly fatal illness for weeks, and all of his hundred or more "particular friends" ditch him.)
</li><li> Mr. Elliot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Persuasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Persuasion">Persuasion</a></em> is quite a sinister version. He married his first wife for money, and though she loved him, he was callous and cold to her after the wedding and she died a very unhappy woman. He was as close as family to his good friends the Smiths—encouraging them to spend far past their means to keep him in style, and then abandoning them when they went broke. He doesn't so much as twitch a finger to help Mrs. Smith get an inheritance she's legally entitled to, not because he's claiming it but because he can't be <em>bothered</em>.

Later, she emigrated to Aurora, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreeLoveFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreeLoveFuture">Free-Love Future</a> planet, but the problem persisted because, with the free attitude, there was once again neither Giver nor Taker. Then, she was given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots">Ridiculously Human Robot</a> and did manage to have an orgasm, but she was only a Taker because a robot cannot Take. And then, she had sex with Baley when he was near-unconscious with exhaustion, to experience the role of a Giver. Considering she then married an Auroran and lived with him for over a century, it can be assumed all this gave her the proper perspective.

Peggy is the worst one. Whereas the kids eventually get jobs and start paying their own way, what she contributes to the relationship is questionable, given that she refuses to get a job, cook or clean the house, and constantly spends Al's money on useless junk and Bon Bons. Peg justifies this by claiming that she does serve a function: boosting Al's ego as the sole breadwinner. How much Peg is right is up to debate, but an early episode did have Peg get a job. Al became almost as miserable as Peg was because he actually liked having her around and he <em>enjoyed</em> complaining about her freeloading.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a> and Wilson are a little unusual, since their relationship, while strange and disturbing, actually seems to <em>work</em> for both of them — House's selfishness has prevented him from having any other friends, and while Wilson keeps embracing vulnerable people and nursing them towards mental health and self-confidence, he invariably loses all interest in them once they no longer need him to take care of them. House, by contrast, is a bottomless pit of need; no matter how much Wilson (or anyone else) gives, it's never enough. The only person who could put up with the ultimate Giver in the long run is the ultimate Taker, and vice versa.

</li><li> Fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GossipGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GossipGirl">Gossip Girl</a></em> often complain about how Nate and Chuck's friendship is like this, ironically with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">Nate</a> being the taker and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Chuck</a> the giver. Chuck will always bend over backwards to help Nate while Nate had to be forced by Blair to help get Chuck off the barstool and attend his father's funeral.

While Cas has done an endless list of things for Sam and Dean (usually at the cost of his own well being), he has not asked something from the Winchesters in return more than twice. However, although he doesn't usually get as much as a "thanks" in return, what has really been irking some fans is that on the one time Cas actually needed the Winchesters to support him, they failed to do so. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's arguable that the whole Leviathan business could have been avoided if only Sam and Dean had listened to Cas, instead of turning on him for making a deal with a demon... something the Winchesters themselves do on a daily basis.</span>
</li><li> The title character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em> and John in the initial stages of their friendship. John is extremely tolerant of Sherlock, who makes no effort to be either easy to live with or particularly accommodating, despite John being willing to kill criminals and put his life on the line for Sherlock's sake. Ultimately averted, however, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sherlock allows the world to believe he is "a fake genius" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">stages his own suicide to safeguard John's and their other friends' lives</a></span>. John himself doesn't seem to believe this of their relationship, as stated by him during his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">graveyard spiel following Sherlock's supposed death</span>: "I was so alone, and I owe you so much." Understandable, as the very first episode hints that John sorely misses the thrill and danger of war, and that helping Sherlock with his cases gives him a sense of purpose and allows him to experience the excitement he craves.

It isn't bad-intentioned on Sekai's part and she truly does see Setsuna as her best friend, but she also completely fails to consider Setsuna's feelings regarding her actions (like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">taking the guy she had a crush on</span>). It's largely Setsuna's fault as well, though; her only concern in life seems to be Sekai's happiness, and she is willing to steamroll over anyone and anything she has to in order to achieve this. The best examples of this are the lengths she'll go to in order to keep Kotonoha away from Makoto even after learning that Sekai had lied to her about them previously breaking up, and when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she offers Makoto the chance to have sex with her if he promises to stay faithful to Sekai afterwards</span>.

In most of her relationships with her classmates prior to meeting Kamen, Momo was a Giver whose kind and helpful nature was frequently abused, resulting in her developing trust issues, until she met and came to trust Kamen. When it came to Kamen, however, Momo gradually ended up becoming the Taker, with Kamen noting how Momoko always asked Kamen to do things for her.

Let's Be Heroes</a></em>: For as much as Lord Boxman likes to claim <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasLovedOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasLovedOnes">his robots are his family</a>, he constantly exploits them and treats them like servants, only openly reciprocating their love when they accomplish his goals. The effect this has had on their mental states is about what youd expect:
<div class="indent"><strong>Raymond</strong>: [Shannon] just doesn't seem to realize that love must only be granted when certain expectations are met.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Darrell</strong>: Right? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood">It's like she learned nothing from daddy</a>!
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower">She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Shadow Weaver</a> tends to fall into the "controlling Giver" camp with her parenting and mentorship. She had no problem lavishing her wards (except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavourite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavourite">Catra</a>) with praise and power, laden with manipulation and psychological abuse.
</li><li> Catra's relationship with Adora prior to Adora's defection had strong undertones of this, with Catra as the Taker. However, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredEnamoredUnderling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredEnamoredUnderling">Scorpia</a>, it evolved from under-, to over-, to totally-enveloping-tones. Scorpia was endlessly loyal, self-sacrificing and kind to Catra, and in return Catra offered her tiny scraps of affection mixed with resentment and hostility. Catra has similarly one-sided relationships with other people in her orbit, such as Lonnie and her squad, but Scorpia is the one who deals with the brunt of the exploitation. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eventually, Scorpia realises that Catra is a bad friend and straight-up leaves. This causes Catra immense grief, with Double Trouble later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">calling her out</a> for expecting anyone to stay with her when she does nothing but exploit them.</span>
</li><li> Hordak rewards underlings who please him with a tenuous position in his favour that can be lost in moments. He offers little else. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And Horde Prime is even worse; Hordak struggles for decades to conquer Etheria for him and make contact with him, and Horde Prime calls him defective and casually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rapes</a> him.</span> Fittingly, his forces work on similar protocols; at one point, Scorpia summarises the deal her family made with the Horde as consisting of her people giving up their land, their runestone and their princess, and getting, um, well, she's not sure what but she's sure there was something.
</li></ul></li><li> This is the relationship between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Chloé</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaBitch">Sabrina</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug">Miraculous Ladybug</a></em>. Sabrina does Chloé's schoolwork for her, carries out the grunt work in Chloé's petty schemes, and generally waits on her "best friend" hand and foot. Chloé offers rather little in return outside of the occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> moment.
