If the villain is <em>much</em> larger, the hero may attempt a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColossusClimb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColossusClimb">Colossus Climb</a>.
</p><p>This trope is named after the biblical account of David and Goliath from <a class="urllink" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%2017;&amp;version=31;">1 Samuel, chapter 17.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (Note that in that story, David claims to have won only through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineIntervention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineIntervention">Divine Intervention</a>, so ironically, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> is not an accurate example of the Trope.)

C. It doesn't protect him from the effects of said powers such as shrapnel. D. Using this ability means he can't use any sort of weaponry and therefore has to get into punching range of his opponent. E. It's only a single limb, not his entire body. Opponents so far: An esper with extremely potent electric abilities. An essentially all-powered magician able to draw on what is apparently the entirety of magical knowledge. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> who can literally kill with a thought or do anything he thinks of. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPowerLottery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPowerLottery">Accelerator, who can not only take a nuke head on but hit you back with it even harder.</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fiamma of the Right, a magician who has an undodgeable and always lethal attack and can level cities without effort. <em>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelGabriel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelGabriel">Archangel Gabriel</a>, second most powerful angel in existence who can end all life on Earth in minutes.</em></span> Basically, a partial immunity to their abilities on his side and <em>street fighting skills.</em> David Versus Goliath much? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And naturally, any opponents who don't rely entirely on these abilities tend to crush him.

<ul><li> Shiage is an even bigger underdog in his fights against superpowered enemies, he doesn't have any superpower at all. He becomes very interested in magic when he learns of it, but is quickly told that he can't use magic: while he's a Level 0, he's still an esper, and therefore incompatible with magic. Sucks to be him.
</li></ul></li><li> While most fights with the outclassed characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> results in a straight up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a>, the exception occurs at the end of the Saiyan Saga. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero">Son Gohan</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">Krillin</a> end up having to stop Vegeta when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Goku</a> wasn't able to. Krillin and Gohan were no match for Vegeta's flunky Nappa (who Goku flattened), and even though Vegeta is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfHadTheFlu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfHadTheFlu">injured out from his fight with Goku</a>, he still has enough fight the two of them can't even scratch him. However, despite the odds, they manage to narrowly win after hitting him with leftover energy from Goku's Genkidama and Gohan using the artificial moon Vegeta created to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">turn into an Oozaru</a> and injures him enough to force him to (barely) retreat.
<ul><li> In fact, <em>Dragon Ball</em> is one of the ultimate subverters of the trope. Vegeta, Freeza, Majin Buu and Beerus were either small characters or their final forms were not their largest. Not to mention Goku as a kid, who for most of his childhood looked like an eight year old, took down characters much bigger than him, especially Great Demon King Piccolo.

In reality, however, neither Agon or Shin are especially tall, Sena's just <em>that</em> short.
<ul><li> A better example would be the lanky Mizumachi vs the stout Komosubi. Their entire challenge is about who is more stronger between a tall end a short guy.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em>: Kenshiro isn't exactly a small guy, but he usually takes on huge people, sometimes <em>twice</em> his size, and wins handily most of the time (keeping in mind that Raoh is also bigger than him).
</li><li> Soccer manga and anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GiantKilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GiantKilling">Giant Killing</a></em> is basically about this: the protagonist is a coach whose mission is to bring a bottom-feeder Japanese team (for which he played in his professional career and was an idol before moving to an English team in the same situation) up to top contender level. The term "Giant Killing" redirects here because it is a common saying for this trope as applied to association football.

It's like pitting an adult against a child. If that wasn't bad enough, Murasakibara is physically the most gifted player in the league by an <em>enormous</em> margin, while Kuroko is inarguably the weakest starter Serin has, possibly the weakest player, physically, in the series.

Nonetheless, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kuroko wins their one-on-one by using their disproportionate strengths and his lack of presence to make Murasakibara forget that he's being marked, and then ducks into the path of his movement to draw a foul as Murasakibara turns around carelessly</span>.

<ul><li> David Haye at 6'3" and 215 pounds took on the 7'0" over 22 stone (310 pounds) Nikolai Valuev, the heaviest boxer in history - 'Goliath Versus Bigger Goliath' if you will. Even though he broke his wrist in the attempt he came out on top.
<div class="indent">"He is the ugliest thing I have ever seen. I have watched <em>Lord of the Rings</em> and films with strange looking people, but for a human being to look like he does is pretty shocking." - Haye
</div><ul><li> Every match David Haye had at heavyweight, really. Audley Harrison, Monte Barrett, John Ruiz, Dereck Chisora, Mark de Mori, and Arnold Gjergjaj all outweighed Haye by between 10 and 40 pounds in their respective fights- and all of them got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">crushed</a>. His athleticism, skill, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegatonPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegatonPunch">insanely disproportionate punching power</a> carried him to victory. The exception was when he challenged unified world heavyweight champion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAndSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAndSkilled">Wladimir Klitschko</a>, who was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">faster</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusclesAreMeaningful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusclesAreMeaningful">harder-hitting</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter">at least as skilled</a> as Haye, on top of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusclesAreMeaningful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusclesAreMeaningful">6'6 and 245 pounds</a>. Haye lost handily, though it should be noted that unlike most of Wladimir's other opponents, Haye did manage to put in a decent showing by winning a few rounds and finishing the fight on his feet without major damage, which is a small victory.
</li></ul></li><li> Possibly the best example in boxing was Evander Holyfield vs Nikolai Valuev. Holyfield was a bit smaller than Haye; Valuev, as noted, was seven feet tall and weighed over three hundred and ten pounds. Valuev also ended his career with a 50-2 record (having never been knocked down, stopped, or even UD'd) and 34 knockouts, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusclesAreMeaningless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusclesAreMeaningless">Muscles Are Meaningless</a> was definitely <em>not</em> in effect. On top of this, Holyfield was <em>46</em>, practically ancient by boxing standards; even taking on a respectable contender his own size at that age would have been considered extremely impressive, much less a world heavyweight champion over a foot taller than him, whose weight advantage over Holyfield was bigger than the advantage Holyfield would hold over a flyweight. Despite this, Holyfield put up a damn good fight and only lost by a close majority decision- and many commentators still contend that he won the fight.
</li><li> Inverted by Manny Pacquiao against the taller, longer-reaching Oscar de la Hoya on their December 8th, 2008 "Dream Match" for eight rounds. As <a class="urllink" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/fightcred/round?id=3733277">ESPN's analysis<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> put it in round 5, "Forget pull the trigger, De La Hoya doesn't even have a gun."
<ul><li> Inverted again, this time against Antonio Margarito in the Pacquiao Versus Margarito fight. Pacquiao did such a good job in the fight that pictures of a chinky-eyed Asian boxer are currently going around while people claim it's really Margarito. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It is.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Perhaps the most extreme examples (and one of the earlier ones caught on video) was the title bout between Jess Willard and Jack Dempsey in 1919. Many people thought the fight would be a mismatch as Willard had about 6 inches and 60 pounds on the smaller Dempsey. Instead Dempsey unleashed perhaps the most savage and brutal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No-Holds-Barred Beatdown</a> in boxing history on Willard and forever etched his legend into boxing lore. To this day Dempsey's name is synonymous with the words ruthless and relentless in boxing circles, and many latter days fighters such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikeTyson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikeTyson">Mike Tyson</a> purposefully adopted and imitated a number of Dempsey's mannerisms.
</li><li> Speaking of Mike Tyson, he was exceptionally short for a heavyweight, with a short reach, meaning he was often the smaller fighter and yet routinely destroyed his opponents. While him losing to mid-level contender Buster Douglas at the height of his career is shocking, it is less so when you consider that Douglas had 4-5 inches of height, a lot of reach, and around 20 pounds of muscle on Tyson. Even more so when you consider that the death of Douglas' mother inspired Buster to make a once in a lifetime effort in the ring that night.
</li><li> Rocky Marciano vs Joe Louis in 1951, both ways. On one hand, Louis was more experienced, stronger, and much bigger, at 6'2 and 214 pounds to Marciano's 5'10 and 184 pounds (that fight wouldn't even be allowed today due to the weight disparity; the cutoff for heavyweight was changed to 191 pounds in 1979 and 201 pounds in 2003). On the other, Marciano was younger by nearly a decade. Louis had in fact come out of retirement the previous year to fight Marciano, and while Louis wasn't totally out of practice (he had beaten eight fighters in the preceding year) and still possessed his signature power, his stamina and speed had noticeably degraded. Louis was slightly favored to win, and got in a few good licks early on, but Marciano came to dominate the fight and knocked Louis out in the eighth round.
</li><li> Similar story with Evander Holyfield vs George Foreman in 1991. Both were top-ranked heavyweights, but Foreman had such a big advantage in both experience and size on Holyfield that it was ridiculous- he went into the fight at 257 pounds with a 69-2 record, while Holyfield was 208 pounds with a 25-0 record.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0blcm');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0blcm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0blcm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">To give you some idea for how insane a disparity of fifty pounds is: the max allowable size of a welterweight (147 pounds) is also about fifty pounds less than the max allowable size of a crusierweight (200 pounds), with that range encompassing <em>six</em> weight classes (welter, super welter, middle, super middle, light heavy, cruiser).</span> The disparity is even greater when you consider <em>only</em> heavyweight experience, i.e. fights where their opponent weighed over 200 pounds (Holyfield was a former cruiserweight champion, not heavyweight, and Foreman's career started in an era where heavyweight started at 175 pounds instead of 200 pounds as it does today); in that case Foreman's record was 52-2 and Holyfield's was 7-0. Balancing this out was that Foreman was 42 years old while Holyfield was just shy of 30- while Foreman was if anything <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoutStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoutStrength">even stronger and tougher</a> than he was in his youth (he did gain forty pounds, after all), he was also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">slower</a>. While it wasn't totally one-sided, Holyfield consistently beat Foreman to the punch with his superior reflexes and had him severely hurt in the later rounds, while not allowing himself to fall victim to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegatonPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegatonPunch">Megaton Punch</a> of his giant opponent as future champ Michael Moorer would.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder7');">Â Â Â Â Fighting SportsÂ </div><div class="folder" id="folder7" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Randy Couture's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts">Mixed Martial Arts</a> victory over Tim Sylvia, a man seven inches taller, forty pounds heavier, and thirteen years younger. "Big man versus small man" MMA fights are very popular in Japan. Fedor Emelianenko (183 cm and 100 kilos) has faced and defeated the aforementioned Tim Sylvia (203 cm), Mark Hunt (125 kilos), Zuluzinho (201 cm and 177 kilos!), and Choi Hong-man (166 kilos and an unbelievable 218cm)... all in one round each. He also has a notable win by decision over Semmy Schilt (212 cm and 133 kilos). However, the smaller man in these matches is invariably far more skilled than his opponent and highly favored to win.
<ul><li> Eventually inverted in both men's cases. Couture moved back to Light Heavyweight after losing Heavyweight title to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar">Brock Lesnar</a> and Fedor was completely dominated by Antonio Silva (194 cm and 130 kilos). In early days of MMA big fighters usually coasted on their size (or in case of Hunt and Schilt were kickboxers with almost no grappling skill) and could be defeated by smaller, skilled guys. Modern Goliaths like Lesnar, Alistair Overeem, and Antonio Silva bring both size and skill, meaning former Heavyweight greats who weigh around 100 kg (Fedor, Mirko Cro Cop, Couture, Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira) are no longer as dominant as they used to be.
</li><li> The secret is that unlike kickboxing an MMA fight can go to the ground, where the height and weight can <em>sometimes</em> be a disadvantage when grappling there. While Fedor basically slugged out Zuluzinho and Sylvia on their feet, Choi actually took Fedor down and Hunt almost submitted Fedor on the ground before he eventually came back to beat them on the ground.
</li><li> There was also the 2009 Super Hulk Tournament where four guys of varying lighter weights were put up against four apparent behemoths â€” middleweight Ikuhisa "Minowaman" Minowa against Bob Sapp, middleweight Gegard Mousasi against Mark Hunt, light heavyweight Rameau Thierry Sokoudjou against Jan "The Giant" Nortje, and the debuting ex-Major League Baseball player Jose Canseco against Choi Hong-man; with the exception of the untrained, mid-40s Canseco all of the "Davids" won, complete with Bob Sapp (getting a bye thanks to the "injured" Mousasi withdrawing) being eliminated twice, and the finals are between the middleweight Minowa and light heavyweight Sokoudjou.
</li></ul></li><li> These fights happen all the time in K-1 kickboxing, where the only weight classes are at 70kilos and unlimited. This has lead to such notable matchups like Mighty Mo (slightly over 6 feet) vs Choi Hong Man (towering over 7 feet), where Mo KO'd the Korean giant with a single punch, Kaoklai Kaennorsing (80 kilos) vs Mighty Mo (at 130 kilos), where Kaoklai knocked Mo out with a flying kick to the head, and Nicholas Pettas (at less than 6 feet) vs Kim Young Hyun (almost as big as the aforementioned Choi Hong Man) where Pettas thrashed the Korean giant with a fury of ruthless kicks.
<ul><li> Speaking of K-1, Kid Yamamoto of the now-defunct K-1 Hero's and now, DREAM promotions made it a point to fight at the 155 lb. weight class, while he walks around at 143 lbs and 5'4. He fights people who weigh in at 155 lbs. and regain all their water weight before the actual fight (We're talking 10 pounds or so, here). He has a record of 17-1 - I think you can figure out the rest. 20 pounds isn't that huge of a number but size definitely matters in this sport. That's why there ARE weight classes.
</li></ul></li><li> Somewhat a case of "Goliath Versus Bigger Goliath," but Cain Velasquez (6 foot 1, weighed in at 244) defeated Brock Lesnar for the UFC heavyweight championship (6 foot 3, weighed in at 264) when his wrestling skill was at least roughly on par with Lesnar's but his striking skill was <em>that</em> much better. (It should be noted that heavyweight has a much, MUCH wider range of allowed weights than any other weight class.)
</li><li> Played straight and ultimately inverted by Royce Gracie. With an unimpressive-looking physique and anywhere from 175 to 180 pounds (he'd be a middleweight under the modern weight classes), he didn't look very imposing. In fact, that's why Rorion Gracie, the founder of UFC, chose him instead of Rickson to be their torchbearer, to prove that the style could overcome physical limitations. For a while, it looked like the classic scrappy-little-guy-finds-a-way-to-prevail story. Then a few ugly facts entered the picture...like, while he may not have been massive, he had tremendous speed, flexibility, stamina, and toughness, and he had <em>tremendous</em> strength for a middleweight. Not to mention that he was a master of ground fighting, something most of his opponents didn't know the first thing about. By the time UFC 5 rolled around, he was downright legendary, so much so that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KenShamrock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KenShamrock">Ken Shamrock</a></em> was frightened of him. This was almost certainly the main reason Gracie was able to escape with a draw in their matchup, as Shamrock (who actually had a pretty good chance of winning) was too intimidated to get any real offense going.

The Bible account stresses that Goliath needed an attendant to place his shield and guide his steps. While this was not unknown in armies of the day - the shield referred to was a large slab of wood and hide that could not be carried and needed to be emplaced - circumstantial evidence strongly suggests Goliath suffered from aggravated gigantism, which would allow a smaller, nimbler, foe to attack from his blind sides.</span><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4mf91');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4mf91" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4mf91');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Claims about Goliath being disabled by gigantism, however, does require one to disregard the fact that Goliath was the <em>champion</em> and greatest fighter among the Philistine army, which would certainly imply great prowess and an ability to handle major combat; this was not a cripple with a glaring weakness, it was a hardened veteran who knew what he was doing.</span> The application of this trope in the story has suffered somewhat from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">Technology Marches On</a>; a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sling_%28weapon%29">sling<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is <em>not</em> a slingshot, it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeItem">hits like a bullet</a>.

It talks mainly about a girls' basketball team reaching the National Junior Basketball Championships due solely to the full-court press (Instead of the 'normal' method of immediately retreating to guard your own basket when the other team has possession, the full-court press is aggressively defending against the other team in their own court.) The main reason that the full-court press worked is that it wears down both teams' stamina much faster - and the girls' team had worked almost solely on building stamina. The girls' team rode roughshod over other teams with taller girls and better shooting technique due to the fact that the other team couldn't get shots off due to having the ball stolen when they weren't expecting it, or losing possession for not bringing the ball back into play or in the other team's court fast enough. In some cases, they had 25-0 leads over other teams. The girls were then castigated by the other teams for playing 'unfairly' and not letting the teams 'develop basketball skills' - to the degree that fights nearly broke out. The team then lost its final game by caving to pressure and playing the 'proper' way after the referee (supplied by the opposing team) called excessive amounts of fouls. The general moral of the story is that when David plays by Goliath's rules, David usually gets crushed. However, by changing his tactics, David can become the favorite over Goliath. However, Goliath will respond in kind by using social pressure to force David to fight by Goliath's rules.

The Colts were favored by a ridiculous 22 point spread, but that didn't stop Jets quarterback Joe Namath from guaranteeing a win. The Jets would go on to shock the world, winning 16-7.
</li><li> Super Bowl XXXVI. The St. Louis Rams were coming off a 14-2 season with the NFL's top offense, the league MVP Kurt Warner, and the Offensive Player of the Year Marshall Faulk. They were just one year removed from winning one of the greatest Super Bowls of all time, and were largely considered a better squad than 1999. They would have to play against a scrappy New England Patriots squad that came in at 11-5, barely (and controversially) won their two playoff games to reach the big game, was led by a backup quarterback after their starter severed an artery in his chest, and were 0-2 in Super Bowls prior. The Patriots had to play 60 minutes of near-perfect football and still barely escaped with a 20-17 win in the final seconds.
</li><li> Super Bowl XLII is an absolutely perfect example of this trope. The New England Patriots (boasting what many called the greatest offense in NFL history), led by quarterback Tom Brady (league MVP by a large margin, with stats worthy of some deeming his 2007 season the best ever of any NFL quarterback) and Randy Moss (who had scored the most touchdowns of any wide receiver in NFL history that year), went undefeated in the regular season, a 16-0 mark that no other team had ever accomplished, and on top of that, defeated the same New York Giants they would face in the Super Bowl in Week 17 of the regular season in what was an extremely climactic battle. Their opponents, the aforementioned Giants, were a Wild Card team who had barely made it into the Playoffs, had to eke out wins in the post-season on the road by slim margins, and had many players sidelined by injury. The Giants, however, used their effective pass rush to force Tom Brady into quick throws. The Patriots were unable to score the large amount of points they were accustomed to, and this kept the Giants in the game. Despite Brady still performing at a high level in the game, his team scored only two touchdowns (in ironic fashion, before the big game, Brady literally laughed at the fact that Giants wide receiver Plaxico Burress claimed that the Patriots would only score 17 points in the Super Bowlâ€” the team averaged roughly 35 points per game in the regular season). The Giants would win the game after an improbable play in which Eli Manning escaped the grasp of numerous would-be New England tacklers and hurled the football down the field, which was caught by David Tyree by pinning it against his own helmet as New England's Rodney Harrison forcefully tackled him and attempted to pry the ball loose. New York would then score the winning touchdown and force a turnover on downs as the Patriots attempted to get in field-goal range with 29 seconds remaining.
</li><li> Super Bowl XLIII: The Arizona Cardinals, a franchise known for its inability to go to the playoffs and who has the second longest championship drought in American professional sports, facing off against the Pittsburgh Steelers, quite well known for their ability to make it to Super Bowls. In fact, they've been to more Super Bowls than any other team in the league minus the Cowboys. The Cardinals nearly won on a valiant, almost inhuman fourth-quarter effort by receiver Larry Fitzgerald, but the Steelers came back and earned a 27-23 win to obtain their sixth Super Bowl.
</li><li> In college Football September, 1 2007 Appalachian State (a Division I-AA school) defeated #5 ranked Michigan. <strong><em>At</em></strong> Michigan!
</li><li> Also in college Football, 2006 Fiesta Bowl. Boise State-Oklahoma. Heck, when the broadcast team openly acknowledge the trope ("This is truly a David and Goliath situation" etc), and an undefeated team goes up against one of the winningest teams in the history of the sport. And pulls off one of THE most improbable and thrilling wins....yeah, I think it qualifies.
</li><li> In College Basketball March 26, 2006. University of Connecticut, a team with 6 players that would be drafted in the NBA, a 1 seed in their bracket in the NCAA tournament, and the odds-on favorite to win the whole thing, takes on George Mason, a school that had only 3 tournament appearances before the 2006 tournament. The Patriots, no relation to the cheaters from New England mind you, shock everyone with an 86-84 overtime victory, sending them to the Final Four and UConn players to the coldness of the NBA.
</li><li> The ultimate David in the 1980 US Hockey team, a bunch of College kids that defeated the all mighty Soviet team...after getting creamed by THE SAME TEAM 13 days earlier.
</li><li> Baseball has this at times, but the 2008 Tampa Bay Rays have to take the cake. They play in the AL East division, home to the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox (teams with virtually limitless coffers and very solid teams; their payrolls are about $200 million and $150 million, respectively). With a payroll of ~$40 million, they <em>win the AL East outright</em>, and they make it to the World Series before losing to the Phillies after being tabbed as the underdogs in every round (especially the AL Championship Series, which they barely took over the Red Sox).
</li><li> Football (Soccer) has a version of this which is known by fans and insiders as Giant Killing, where a small team who would usually have no chance of beating a huge team will pull it off. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFACup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFACup">The FA Cup</a> is usually where to find it, happens more than you might imagine...
<ul><li> Great example was the 2011 Women's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FIFAWorldCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FIFAWorldCup">FIFA World Cup</a>. Two times champion United States, home of great players such as Abby Wambach, Hope Solo, Alex Morgan, and Megan Rapinoe, pulled many victories such as defeating the strong Brazilian team <em>in a 122 minute plus penalties match</em>, was in the finals against Japan, which reached there mostly through upsets (including defeating home team and defending champions Germany). Amazingly, the American <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">Amazon Brigade</a> that towered over the Japanese (literally. Some of the above-listed names are almost 6 ft, while the average height of the Japanese players was under 5'5'') failed to score only on seemingly endless opportunities and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyGirl">Nadeshiko Japan</a> resisted until the penalty shootouts, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkHorseVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkHorseVictory">which they won</a>.
</li><li> The 2004 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EuropeanChampionship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EuropeanChampionship">European Championship</a> saw an extraordinary feat of serial giant-killing. Greece arrived as rank outsiders, having only qualified once before when they were knocked out at the group stage. They were widely expected to repeat this feat. But they won their first group match against the hosts, Portugal. Still, they only just reached the quarter-finals ahead of Spain and Russia, and only beat Spain on goals scored. Nobody expected them to win their quarter-final against France, the defending champions and one of the pre-tournament favourites. But they did, and found themselves up against the Czech Republic in the semi-final. The Czechs were considered the form team, having won all three of their group matches and having won their quarter-final 3-0. Surely Greece couldn't beat them? They could, and reached the final. Could they somehow possibly be able to beat Portugal on their own soil for a second time? Yup, somehow they did, and took the trophy home.
</li><li> The legendary <em>Alcorconazo</em>, in which the most successful European side in history, Real Madrid, were swept away by third-tier AlcorcÃ³n in the Spanish King's Cup. By the 50th minute of the first leg, the score read AlcorcÃ³n 4 - 0 Real Madrid. Madrid, in fact, did not score until the 80th minute of the second leg, when the outcome was already all but settled.
</li></ul></li><li> Not entirely uncommon in roller derby; some smaller players have made an art out of taking out larger ones. It involves a certain level of momentum and landing a shoulder check in just the right place, in such a way as to lift the other player into the air without very much effort. And, since most jammers are the smallest, lightest players on any given team, pretty much every jam involves a certain level of David v. Goliath for them to get through the pack in the first place.
<ul><li> Roller derby also has inversions at times; while jammers are typically small, super fast players who can get through the pack without being hit at all, some teams have "heavyweight jammers," large women who are nearly impossible to knock down, who can clear their own path, or who can wipe smaller jammers clean off the track.
</li></ul></li><li> The 2010 Seattle Seahawks were the first NFL team in a non strike shortened year to win a division with a losing record. Their playoff game was against the defending Super Bowl champion New Orleans Saints. How much of an underdog were they? Before the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TheOnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TheOnion">The Onion</a> posted a picture of the Seahawks with the caption, "Saints get first round bye." Despite being double-digit underdogs, Seattle pulled out the victory propelled by an amazing touchdown run, leading to the infamous headline, <a class="urllink" href="https://sports.theonion.com/new-orleans-saints-lose-first-round-bye-1819590105">"New Orleans Saints Lose First Round Bye."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The 2001 World Series featured The New York Yankees who were playing for the 4th consecutive World Series vs the Arizona Diamondbacks, who were playing their fourth season. Despite multiple comebacks from the Yankees and having to face the greatest closer in baseball history, the Diamondbacks prevailed
</li><li> The Louisville women's basketball team faced several Goliaths during their 2013 NCAA tournament run.
<ul><li> A 5-seed entering the tournament, the Cardinals won their first two games to make the Sweet 16. There they met Baylor, the reigning national champions who were 74-1 over the past 2 seasons (with the only loss coming against #4 Stanford when their second best player was injured). Bonus points for Baylor having a literal Goliath on their roster, 6'8" player of the year, Brittney Griner. Louisville played a very physical game to limit Griner, and made a tournament record 16 3-pointers to find themselves up late in the game. One of the game's signature moments was when Louisville point guard Shoni Schimmel, nearly a foot shorter than Griner, drove on her, scored, drew a foul, and turned to briefly stare Griner down. After Schimmel fouled out with 4 minutes to go, the Cards remained in the game, but fell behind with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownToTheLastPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownToTheLastPlay">9 seconds to go</a>. They then drove the length of the court and drew a foul. Monique Reid, a player who had missed a key free throw only minutes earlier, was taking the shots. She made both, and Louisville pulled off what many thought was an impossible upset.
</li><li> In the Elite 8, they met Goliath #2, Tennessee. The Lady Vols had won 8 national championships in their history, more than any other team of the time. It was an admittedly down year for the program, but they were still a very good team. Louisville built up a lead and managed to hang on in the second half to get another upset, and advanced to the Final Four.
</li><li> In the Final Four, they faced Cal. Not as much of a Goliath as the other two, but still a good team and favored to beat the Cardinals. After falling behind by 10 points at the half, Louisville made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiracleRally" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiracleRally">comeback</a> and took the lead late in the game, ultimately winning and becoming the lowest seed ever to reach the championship game.
</li><li> In the National Championship, they faced powerhouse UConn, a program with (at the time) 7 national championships, and a team that had beaten Louisville handily during the regular season. A win against this Goliath would secure their run as the greatest in tournament history. Unfortunately for the Cardinals, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">reality ensued,</a> and they wound up on the losing end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">largest blowout</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">in championship game history</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note50ty7');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note50ty7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note50ty7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This would be the first of four straight national titles for UConn.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The NCAA Men's Tournament in general features several opportunities in the early rounds for David to fell Goliath before Goliath gets a chance to make a deep run. More often than not, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">another Goliath restores order</a> as early as the second round, though David occasionally runs as far as the Final Four.
<ul><li> The 1985 Villanova Wildcats were a rare David to run the full March Madness gauntlet. The Big East emerged as a powerful conference in short order after their inception in the 1979Â–80 season. The Georgetown Hoyas and St. John's Red Storm pressed forward as championship favorites while the Wildcats were an afterthought, entering the Big Dance with an 18-9 regular-season record (9-7 vs Big East opponents).
<ul><li> The Mideast 8-seed Wildcats first edged out 9-seed Dayton 51-49. Dayton played on their home court in the game.
</li><li> Nova then took down 1-seed Michigan 59-55. Michigan featured eventual first-round selections Roy Tarpley and Gary Grant.
</li><li> Nova then upset 5-seed Maryland 46-43 in a Mideast semifinal.
</li><li> The Wildcats defeated 2-seed North Carolina, a perennial power, 56-44 in the Mideast final.
</li><li> In the semifinals, they bested Midwest 2-seed Memphis State (since renamed the University of Memphis) 52-45.
</li><li> In the national championship game, the Wildcats faced off against Georgetown, who featured Patrick Ewing, David Wingate Jr. and Reggie Williams in their starting five. The Hoyas became heavy favorites after settling one final score with West 1-seed St. John's 77-59. Behind two late free throws and an intercepted pass in the closing seconds, Villanova upset Georgetown 66-64 and emerged with the program's first national title. They were the lowest seed ever to win an NCAA Tournament.
</li></ul></li><li> Other notable Davids:
<ul><li> The 1986 LSU Tigers, the first 11-seed to reach the Final Four, still tied for the lowest seed to do so. It took them two overtime periods just to get past their first opponent, 6-seed Purdue, but they kept rolling after that, and unlike future 11-seeds, they went through the toughest possible path, facing the 3-seed, 2-seed, and 1-seed in the following three rounds (the three later ones would face a 7, 10, and 7, in chronological order, in the Sweet 16 rather than a 2, and the most recent one played a 9 in the Elite Eight instead of a 1).
</li><li> The 2002 Missouri Tigers, the only team seeded 12 or lower to reach the Elite Eight. While this accomplishment is slightly dulled by the fact that unlike most 12-seeds who reach the Sweet 16, they were spared from playing a 1-seed, it should also be noted that the 8-seed that took care of said 1-seed the previous round was <em>UCLA</em>, the most successful program in the sport's history.
</li><li> The 2011 VCU<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6lnsz');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6lnsz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6lnsz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Virginia Commonwealth University</span> Rams. Five years after George Mason's run (see above), the Rams, coming from the same conference,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7obye');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7obye" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7obye');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">At the time, Mason and VCU were members of the Colonial Athletic Association. VCU left for the Atlantic 10 Conference, considered by some to be a major basketball league, in 2012; Mason rejoined them a year later.</span> were considered a controversial at-large pick, but due to the newly expanded field, they had to play in the "First Four", forcing them to win just to reach the Round of 64. They easily handled their fellow borderline at-large selection, then crushed their next two opponents, 6-seed Georgetown and 3-seed Purdue. They struggled with fellow low seed Florida State, a 10-seed, in the Sweet 16, but rebounded to beat top seed Kansas, 71-61, to reach the Final Four, whereupon they ran into...
</li><li> The Butler Bulldogs. Already notable after losing in the Championship Game the previous year as a 5-seed, the Bulldogs, like the Rams a "mid-major" team, were an 8-seed in 2011. The 8-vs.-11 was by far the lowest seeding matchup ever in a Final Four game. The Bulldogs lost the Championship Game to Connecticut, who was a "mighty" 3-seed from a power conference... in which they'd been the <em>9-seed</em> in the conference tournament, forcing them to play the maximum five games to take the conference title, which they did.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note06cqn');"><sup>PostscriptÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note06cqn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note06cqn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Bulldogs are no longer a basketball mid-major; they became part of the reconfigured non-football Big East when it launched in 2013.</span>
</li><li> The 2013 Wichita State Shockers, another lower-half-of-the-bracket, mid-major team that made the Final Four. They aren't <em>as</em> strong an example since their path through the region featured a pure David (13-seed La Salle, which managed to pull a pair of upsets of their own to reach the Sweet 16, also having to get through the First Four to even make the Round of 64) and a David-turned-Goliath (Gonzaga, a mid-major darling in the late 1990s, had seen their rise to basketball powerhouse culminate with a <em>1-seed</em> in 2013, which ended with the 9th-seeded Shockers sending them packing in the Round of 32).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1nh69');"><sup>PostscriptÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1nh69" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1nh69');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Shockers followed that up the next season by entering the NCAA tournament unbeatenÂ—the first D-I men's team to do so in over 20 yearsÂ—but lost narrowly in the second round to Kentucky. After three more NCAA tournament appearances, they definitively left the ranks of basketball mid-majors by joining the American Athletic Conference, the other half of the split of the former Big East.</span>
</li><li> The 2013 Florida Gulf Coast Eagles. They became just the seventh 15-seed in tournament history to upset a 2-seed (Georgetown) in the Round of 64, then took it a step further than the previous six by upsetting 7-seed San Diego State to reach the Sweet 16.
</li><li> The 2016 Syracuse Orange. Unlike the other members of this list save for the two sets of Tigers, the 10th-seeded Orange came from a major conference, and their run was at first seemingly a fluke of getting upsets to happen in front of them: 2-seed Michigan State, which was actually considered the favorite to win the region, was bounced in the first round by Middle Tennessee (the first 15-2 upset since FGCU's run), and Gonzaga, back in their old stomping grounds as a dark horse, reached the Sweet 16 as an 11-seed. Even their first opponent, 7-seed Dayton, wasn't from a major conference. Then they ran into the champion of <strong>their <em>own</em></strong> conference, top seed Virginia, in the Elite Eight, and won, becoming the first 10-seed to reach the Final Four.
</li><li> The 2018 tournament was loaded with these... especially in the South Region, which we'll get to in a bit.
</li><li> The other three regions had a few surprises, though they were ultimately won by two 1-seeds (Villanova in the Midwest and Kansas in the East) and a 3-seeded traditional power (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UniversityOfMichigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UniversityOfMichigan">Michigan</a> in the West). In the Midwest, Syracuse made the field as a very controversial 11-seed (i.e., not a few commentators believed they shouldn't have been in the tournament) in the Midwest and got to the Sweet 16; Marshall scored a big upset over Wichita State in the East; and Michigan beat 9-seed Florida State in the regional final after the Seminoles had taken down 1-seed Xavier and 4-seed Gonzaga in the prior two rounds. Now, we'll get to the South...
</li><li> In Thursday's first-round action, LoyolaÂ–Chicago took down Miami (the one in Florida) on a buzzer-beater in an 11-over-6 upset, and 13-seed Buffalo blasted 4-seed and trendy Final Four pick Arizona.
</li><li> Friday's first-round action saw unquestionably the biggest upset in the history of the NCAA (men's) tournament. Ever since the tournament field expanded to 64 teams in 1985, no 16 seed had ever beaten a 1 seed.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8gmlh');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8gmlh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8gmlh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It <em>had</em> happened in the women's tournament in 1998, though that was a fluke that involved a matchup between an underseeded Harvard team and a Stanford team that lost its two best players to knee injuries in the week before the tournament.</span> Enter UMBC.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note95wms');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note95wms" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note95wms');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">University of Maryland, Baltimore County</span> The Retrievers faced top overall tournament seed Virginia... and didn't just beat them, but turned it into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a>, never trailing in the second half on their way to a 20-point win.
</li><li> In the second round, Loyola used another last-second shot to beat 3-seed Tennessee, and Nevada<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10urbm');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10urbm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10urbm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">NevadaÂ–Reno; there's also a NevadaÂ–Las Vegas, but that school calls itself UNLV.</span> took down 2-seed Cincinnati. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Reality ensued</a> for UMBC, which lost a hard-fought game to 9-seed Kansas State. Still, all this made the 2018 South the first region in the history of the men's tournament in which none of the top four seeds made it to the Sweet 16.
</li><li> The insanity continued at the regional site in Atlanta. In the Elite Eight, K-State took down the region's top remaining seed, traditional superpower Kentucky, and Loyola scored <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">another last-second win</a> over Nevada. This resulted in the first 9-and-11 matchup ever in a regional final... which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastOfTheseIsNotLikeTheOthers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastOfTheseIsNotLikeTheOthers">Loyola won by double digits</a>. Loyola's run not only made them the fourth 11-seed to get to the Final Four, but also turned their team chaplain, 98-year-old nun Sister Jean, into a national and even international media sensation.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Marion Bartoli does this with some regularity. Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkHorseVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkHorseVictory">2013 Wimbledon win</a>, however, is <em>not</em> a good example; Bartoli won the title over lower-seeded Sabine Lisicky, who arguably did most of the giant-killing by beating Serena Williams and 2012 finalist Agnieszka RadwaÅ„ska.
</li><li> The 1960 World Series: The Pittsburgh Pirates were grossly outmatched by a New York Yankees team who outscored, outhit and outplayed them in almost every category except wins. The Yankees defeated them in three of the games with scores of 16-3, 10-0 and 12-0 but the Pirates' victories were close (and the Yankees still outhit the Pirates in 3 of those 4 wins). Game 7, which the Pirates won 10-9, was the first to have the series end on a game-winning home run.
</li><li> The 2019 Washington Nationals had this happen twice during their postseason run:
<ul><li> After making the playoffs as the first wild card, few expected the Nationals to get past the Los Angeles Dodgers, the number one seed in the National League and the team with 2nd best record in the 2019 MLB regular season, especially because they had a history of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut">underperforming in elimination games</a> and had not made it into the National League Championship Series in their franchise history; indeed, the Dodgers shut out the Nationals in Game 1 of the Divisional Series. However, the Nationals took Game 2, and after a loss in Game 3, the Nationals won two straight to advance to the NLCS for the first time in franchise history; where they proceeded to sweep the St. Louis Cardinals.
</li><li> And then the Nationals faced the Houston Astros, who had the best record in the major leagues. The Nationals took Games 1 and 2 in Houston, and returned home to lose the next three games. Returning to Houston, the Nationals won Game 6 and 7 back in Houston <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">for their first World Series championship in franchise history.</a>

The best example of such an underdog battle is the Gray Death Legion battle "Alone on Trellwan," where a lone Gray Death <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">Shadow Hawk</a></em> piloted by Grayson Carlyle himself is challenged by a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">Crusader</a></em> and a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">Marauder</a></em> and is expected to escape alive as well as destroy the <em>Crusader</em> on his way out.
<ul><li> In the lore, the Reunification War is generally seen as this, pitting the 1000+ world-sized Star League, backed with the latest technology from the Terran Hegemony and no Ares Accords holding them back, against the Periphery realms of the Magistracy of Canopus, the Outworlds Alliance and the Taurian Concordat (combined having around 130 worlds, and stuck on opposite sides of the Star League with no ability to form a united front). The war took the Star League 20 years, mostly from having to fight the Taurians inch by inch. The Rim Worlds Republic, also a hypothetical target, averted the trope by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm">surrendering almost immediately</a>.

His skin is tougher than steel, he can punch through trees effortlessly and doesn't tire. Kiri is essentially the most skilled assassin on Earth. Unfortunately, he's an assassin and not a magus or anything like that, so he's reduced to hammering at one side of Kouma's neck and then hitting the other to try and break it.

The Scout is a beanpole-thin, short guy, while the heavy is a <em>huge</em> muscleman. Of course, which is the hero and which is the villain depends on which team each is on, and whether or not the Scout can actually defeat the Heavy in a fight depends on how good (or how poor) a player is using one of them, but one good example where the Scout does win occurs in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geNMz0J9TEQ">"Meet the Scout"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

To reinforce the need to outnumber, you get extra command points for every so many ships of each class more than the enemy you have, up to a certain limit, allowing you to field more ships than the Arbitrary Headcount Limit would normally give you. Get enough and you can deploy extra dreadnoughts. While destroyers can occasionally beat dreadnoughts, this relies on swarming and the dreadnought-user failing to include light weapons on his ships and is far from foolproof.

<ul><li> Ibuki, a tiny lightweight weak but skilled female fighter who stands at 5'3 and weighs 101 pounds, but battled the massive 8 foot Abigail in the latter's story mode. The height difference is remarkable and he is taller than a fully standing Ibuki while crouching on his knees.
</li><li> Ibuki also has a battle with final boss Gill, who while massive in his own right at 6'10 isn't as tall as Abigail, but outweighs Ibuki by an entire 644 pounds, and no that massive weight difference isn't caused by Obesity. Those Psycho Lariats are going to hurt.
</li><li> Her rival battle teaming with Rolento against King and Craig Marduk is based on this. While Rolento is no small man, being a full head taller than Ibuki King and Marduk are both among the tallest humans in Tekken. Both dwarf Rolento and Ibuki herself looks pint sized in comparison to them. In the cutscene from the Tekken character's size Ibuki has to jump to try and hit Marduk in the head, which he easily proceeds to knock back the petite ninja.

While he ultimately loses (and Piando spares him, having always known where he was from and not caring), he manages to hold out for surprisingly long period by blinding Piandao and using his quick thinking to stay away from him.

<ul><li> Most of Vietnamese history is like this when it comes to foreign invaders and occupiers. Despite Vietnam being occupied and invaded by several powerful empires and countries in the past that include the Mongols, the Ming Dynasty, the French empire, the Japanese Empire, and even the United States during the Vietnam War, the Vietnamese manage to successfully repel the invaders or kick the occupiers out despite the fact that many invaders and occupiers often have superior military equipment than the Vietnamese. One of the major factors to this is because of the Vietnamese geography of dense forests, high mountains, and cliffs makes it relatively easy to the Vietnamese to utilize <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics">Hit-and-Run Tactics</a> and makes it incredibly difficult for empires to maintain control of the region.
</li></ul></li><li> Afghanistan has a similar reputation to Vietnam, having earned the nickname "The Graveyard of Empires" for the number of times it has been invaded and tossed said invaders out (a short list includes Persia, the Greeks, the Mongols, the Mughals, the British Empire, the Soviet Union, and the United States).

The Soviet Union being the Goliath in the size of the country and the David in the population of the country.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note113np5');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note113np5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note113np5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Most of the USSR was empty and everything east of the Urals may as well have been nonexistent for the European war effort.</span>
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)#Industrial_output">In fact<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, it was the Soviets who were the David in this circumstance, at least for the first couple of years. So said the other wiki: "Germany had far greater resources than did the USSR, and dwarfed its production in every matrix except for oil, having over five times the USSR's coal production, over three times its iron production, three times its steel production, twice its electricity production, and about 2/3 of its oil production." From the initiation of hostilities it also had <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_production_during_World_War_II#GDP">over three times the USSR's GDP<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The Soviets did have a larger population than Germany, but that was a minor advantage at best (just ask China), and the disparity wasn't as big as is often thought.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note128u5o');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note128u5o" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note128u5o');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In fact, adding together Greater Germany, its allies and co-belligerents, and the anti-Soviet areas of the USSR (e.g. the Baltic states, Moldova, West Ukraine, most ethnic German communities), the USSR only had a twenty five percent population advantage.</span>
</li><li> Not only were they much weaker on paper, but the Soviets' reputation was far worse than that of the Germans' and no one seriously expected them to hold out. In the year just prior to Operation Barbarossa, Nazi Germany had overwhelmed France in a mere six weeks. France had, in World War I, held off most of the might of Imperial Germany and taken a lead role in defeating it. Germany also occupied or subverted pretty much the whole rest of Europe over the last two years. Meanwhile, Russia's last world war performance (in the first one) was comparatively pathetic, as the Germans and Austro-Hungarians were able to totally defeat them with the lesser part of their power. The last two decades hadn't done them any favors either: the fragile new Soviet Union had lost wars to minor powers like Poland, the Baltic states, and most famously, Finland. The embarrassing latter incident had only happened a few months prior to Barbarossa. Suffice to say, there was good <em>reason</em> for these reputations.
</li><li> Yet, despite all of the above, the Soviets took on the brunt of the German war machine for two years, and while they suffered grievous losses and lost much of their territory, they eventually halted the German offensive at Moscow, rolled it back somewhat at Rzhev, and stumped their second strategic offensive at Stalingrad. Starting around the time of Kursk, in 1943, the Americans and British intensified their <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_of_the_Reich">air<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Atlantic">naval<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> campaigns and opened up the first ground front in western Europe (Italy, to be followed the next year by France and the Low Countries). This resulted in the bulk of the German air force and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)#Forces">40% of the German army<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> being redirected to fronts other than the Eastern Front. Faced with only half (roughly) of the German war effort, and invigorated further by American Lend-Lease aid, the Soviets were no longer the David, and with their allies collectively constituted the Goliath. Germany wasn't as successful as the David and were crushed by the Allies within the next year and a half.
</li></ul></li><li> On a national scale, there was the Winter War of 1940 between Finland (a relatively small Nordic nation) and the Soviet Union (a colossal nation with one of the world's largest militaries, 30 times as many planes, and 100 times as many tanks). Thanks in no small part to exceptionally cold (even for Russians) winter and extremely well-entrenched defense line judged later to be impenetrable sans for with nuclear weapons, Finland was able to hold off the Soviets for far longer than anyone expected.

He engaged them in a maneuvering fight, rendering his tail gunner useless, and still managed to take down all three on his own, the last one by ripping its wing off with his own aircraft's wing when they made a close head-on pass. How? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">Sheer raw guts</a>, surviving twenty minutes of constant nine-G turns (which would have ripped the wings off the more lightly-constructed Zero and would have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">knocked a normal man unconscious</a> after one turn), until he could finally get some shots off. It certainly helped that the Dauntless carried a pair of nose-mounted M2 .50 caliber machine guns, a respectable if not overwhelming amount of firepower.
<ul><li> Vejtasa later transferred to fighter piloting and became one of the Goliaths, shooting down seven Japanese aircraft in one day during his first engagement, making him one of the rare "Ace in a Day" candidates.

</li><li> During the Falklands War of 1982, Royal Marine Commandos as good as sunk an Argentinian Navy frigate that came close to shore in South Georgia by shooting at it with anti-tank bazookas. The Marines hit it repeatedly under the waterline with Carl Gustav weapons, from such a close range that very few weapons on the frigate could be brought to bear on them. In any case, individual Marines are a hard target for a warship's weapons systems to target. The Argentinian ship was deliberately run aground by its captain to prevent it from sinking, and surrendered later to the Royal Navy.

The Oda forces took advantage of the rainstorm to launch an ambush straight to Yoshimoto's head, killing him and sending his other men to chaos and not only did the Oda scored their greatest victory, but the Imagawa fell to ruin, and the name 'Oda Nobunaga' became known as one of the most fearsome warlords in the era, instead of just 'The Fool of Owari'.
</li><li> Wolves can take on large animals such as bears and moose, but the victors in such conflicts are always hard to determine.
</li><li> The Chilean corvette Esmeralda was something of a David. She was a little bright green fully rigged sailing ship, which even in 1855 looked quaint. She did have two smoke stacks: few observers could have guessed however that she had four boilers, letting her achieve a speed of 8 knots. She had a history of capturing or at least giving a tough time to ships much larger than her. She notably captured a schooner, a ship almost a fourth larger, called the Virgen de Covadonga (of Spain). This was during the Chincha Islands war in 1864-66. Ultimately though, she was sunk by the Peruvian ironclad HuÃ¡scar. Only however because Esmeralda's captain Arturo Pratt let honor (or perhaps frustration) get the better of him. For 3 hours, HuÃ¡scar bombarded Esmeralda with her 300lb Armstrong gun to no effect. Captain Pratt's fatal error was putting Esmeralda in boarding range of HuÃ¡scar.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15p2hw');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15p2hw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15p2hw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The objective of Captain Prat was to carry out the combat aboard the battleship Huascar, because the Esmeralda was not in conditions for combat or defensive maneuvers since its boilers were under repair and the guns could not pierce the armor of the Peruvian ship. The determining factor to change position was the attack of 4 Blakely guns by the Peruvian forces from the ground. By the time of the spur, the corvette was already sinking and the boilers exploded. The boarding did not work because the bugle that the instruction had to touch had died beheaded seconds before, if the plan had worked, a ship would have been lost in bad combat conditions, but with the capture of the most powerful ship in Peru.</span> He and his boarding party were killed by HuÃ¡scar's Gatling gun, while the ironclad proceeded to ram Esmeralda repeatedly until she sank.
</li><li> The First Italo-Ethiopian War saw Ethiopia, a country of allegedly backwards and uncivilized black people, defeat Italy, a European country with a modern military and economy. The twist in this case was that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II</a> had used diplomacy with Italy's European rivals (specifically, France and Russia) to acquire an arsenal of modern weapons. The Ethiopians were arguably better-armed than the Italians, who were equipped with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGetWhatYouPayFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGetWhatYouPayFor">outdated weapons and ammunition that they were trying to use up</a>. The Italians also suffered from poor morale and inaccurate maps, while the Ethiopians knew the terrain well and forced the Italians to fight on terrain of their choosing.
