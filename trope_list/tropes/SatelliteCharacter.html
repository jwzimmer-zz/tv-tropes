<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zigzagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zigzagged">Zigzagged</a> by Ayano of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AsteroidInLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AsteroidInLove">Asteroid in Love</a></em>. For a whole 20 chapters since her introduction, she acts as one towards Sayuri, being members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolNewspaperNewsHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolNewspaperNewsHound">Newspaper Club</a>. It is until Chapter 39 when she is given some spotlight, when her backstory is more fleshed out.
</li><li> Mikasa Ackerman in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>. It's noted in-series that she <em>really</em> can't function very well without Eren.
</li><li> Kaorin of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh">Azumanga Daioh</a></em> exists mainly to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut">in the closet</a> about expressing her feelings towards Sakaki.
<ul><li> And Chihiro has even less to call her own than Kaorin, being defined almost entirely as part of a pair with Kaorin herself. Kaorin at least is defined around Sakaki, Chihiro, <em>and</em> Kimura.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: Tatsuki, Keigo and Mizuiro are defined by their role in the story as the classmates and friends of the story's main <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> (Ichigo, Sado and Orihime and, later, Ishida). Tatsuki is additionally the friend of Orihime and Keigo's role expands a little to encompass Ikkaku and Yumichika. However, the interactions are still based on, and therefore revolve around, what is happening in Ichigo's life at that time. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> states that they were supposed to have more prominent roles in the story, but they inevitably got pushed to the sidelines after the Shinigami and later the arrancar were introduced.
<ul><li> Choujirou Sasakibe, lieutenant of the 1st division (the division of the captain-commander himself). He stays in the background of the story, barely receiving any prominence or dialogue and only ever heading into battle twice, being defeated both times. Justified in universe as it's revealed he made a vow to never become a captain, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (he possesses Bankai)</span> never fight and to only serve Yamamoto rather than serving the Gotei 13 as a whole. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the end, the most important role he has in the story is to become the first good guy to die in the Final Arc, thereby cementing both the power and attitude of the villains as well as putting the captain-commander on the backfoot immediately via the emotional fallout of Sasakibe's death.</span>
</li><li> Though not as bad as the above, as she does get to interact with the other lieutenants and the members of the Women's Shinigami Association in the omakes, Nanao Ise is largely defined by being Kyoraku's no-nonsense <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlFriday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlFriday">Girl Friday</a> and she has no notable relationships with anybody else in the series. She doesn't even take part in any major fights on her own until the Quincy arc, though this does get an explanation in-canon - after what happened to his last lieutenant, Kyoraku just can't bear having Nanao on the frontlines. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Plus, she's his niece and he promised to protect her.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou">Bloom Into You</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolPlay">School Play</a> is the story of a high school girl with amnesia. The rest of the cast- her nurse, her schoolmate, her younger half-brother and her girlfriend- are mostly defined by their relationships with her, and used to explore various facets of her personality. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">This is somewhat justified, since the play is largely a character study about the girl in question</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CastleTownDandelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CastleTownDandelion">Castle Town Dandelion</a></em> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RotatingArcs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RotatingArcs">Rotating Arcs</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Day in the Limelight</a>. As a result, many characters are only associated with one of the 9 Sakurada siblings:
<ul><li> Aoi has her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriends">Childhood Friends</a> Uzuki, Nanao and Shizuru. The latter three are often seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Aoi-sama's attendents</a>, which annoys Aoi to no end.
</li><li> Shuu has his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a>, Hana. Although in Hana's case it is eventually averted as she effectively became part of the Sakurada family <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as Shuu's fiancee</span>.
</li><li> Akane has her Childhood Friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbian">Karen</a> and the vice-class rep Fukushina, which is also secretly the president of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantFanClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantFanClub">Instant Fan Club</a>.
</li><li> Hikari has Matsuoka, her manager and producer, and Sacchan, a fellow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singer</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a></em>, Mary Magdalene's character mostly revolves around her interactions with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chrono</span>. However, she's a creepier version than what's typical, particularly in the manga version (and in fact seems to have been meant to be slightly disturbing)—She's a seer that is so overwhelmed by the visions she has that she can't remember her own childhood or even <em>her real name</em>. There's only one piece of herself she clings onto—<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a dream she's had since she was a child of Chrono being the one to take her life. When she meets him, she willingly allows him to take her away from the safety of the religious order that guarded her because she wanted to get to know him before he killed her.</span>
</li><li> Rivalz Cardemonde from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> is Lelouch's friend, member of the Ashford Student Council, and not much else beyond that. He doesn't really have a stake in the central conflict, relegating him to the status of background character, if <em>that</em>. Shirley, Milly and Kallen have more plot relevance than he does. Even <em>Nina</em>, who may as well have been invisible for the first eleven (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">no pun intended</a>) episodes, has a bigger stake in the plot...though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">saying fan reaction to that has been "less than kind"</a> would be a <em>massive</em> understatement.
<ul><li> Rivalz <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> his status in the penultimate episode with Milly, lamenting that his friends are out there fighting for the fate of the world while he sits on his duff doing nothing but feeling sorry for himself. He actually <em>is</em> appreciated by some small measure of the fanbase for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">quite attuned to his status as one</a>. And several more fans find him cute or fun.
</li><li> Even though she sets up plot-important gatherings and events at her school, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis">Milly</a> doesn't do much at all after she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">graduates from Ashford Academy</span>.
</li><li> A straighter example would be Kanon. We really don't know anything about him besides the fact that he's Schneizel's #2 (or something) and...that's really it. There's nothing else really notable about him and he never really does anything important.
</li></ul></li><li> The fact that Riff from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CountCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CountCain">Count Cain</a></em> exists totally to serve his master becomes a <em>plot point</em> eventually. Especially when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he turns out to be a brainwashed zombie planted by the lead's evil father to set up trauma when Alexis pushes the switch and Cain is betrayed by the person he trusts most.</span> Of course, their relationship is explored fairly extensively, making Riff a possible subversion.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CromartieHighSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CromartieHighSchool">Cromartie High School</a></em> lampshades this with "You", the toady of the requisite snobby rich guy. Not even his boss knows his name, and the character has made numerous attempts to say it. Of course, all of them are interrupted by myriad events, from spilling juice to <em>a meteor hitting the school.</em>
</li><li> Matt in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> is an orphan from Wammy's House who was stated to have been created for Mello, but all we know about Matt apart from his loyalty to him is that he likes video games and cigarettes, he's messy and lazy, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is gunned down while trying to get away from Takada's bodyguards</span>.
<ul><li> Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">the author</a> admitted that Matt was the hardest character to write since he had "no idea what kind of a person he was."
</li></ul></li><li> The various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em> series occasionally fall into this with the partner Digimon - sometimes (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em>) they're well-developed and have actual independent characterization and importance, whereas other times (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers">Digimon Savers</a></em>) they simply don't. Probably the most extreme example is MailBirdramon of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWars">Digimon Xros Wars</a></em> - he has practically zero characterization and a handful of lines early in the series, and seems to exist solely to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaExpansionPack">Mecha Expansion Pack</a> for the much more fleshed-out Greymon, to the point that when they're merged into MetalGreymon/ZekeGreymon, said merger is almost always treated as just Greymon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DNAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DNAngel">D.N.Angel</a></em> has that one guy who is apparently a friend of Daisuke and Saehara, meaning Daisuke will sometimes ignore Saehara's fits to ask him what's happened, instead. A <em>lot</em> of googling will finally reveal his name as Sekimoto Masahiro; finding it mentioned in the manga itself is extremely hard. But he is fairly omnipresent, despite only speaking now and then to bemoan Saehara's antics. There are also the two class representatives; the only thing known about them is their names and relationship - the guy has a crush on the girl, who is oblivious and thus unintentionally cruel to him.
</li><li> Chiaotzu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> was occasionally shown in promotional art alongside the rest of the Z-Fighters, as if he was an important character with his own desires and conflicts. This couldn't be further from the truth (even in the original Dragon Ball!), as Chiaotzu only exists to be Tien Shinhan's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">best friend</a>, is barely ever seen speaking to any other Z-Fighters and has no character traits other than "admiring Tien". Eventually, his appearances become rarer and rarer, and whenever he's seen, he's literally floating around Tien.
<ul><li> Villain example: Nappa exists mainly as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute">The Brute</a> to his boss <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPrince">Vegeta</a>, having no real personality or characterization beyond being a mean bastard who likes smashing the Z-warriors into the ground.
</li><li> Puar is mainly defined by being Yamcha's best friend and having the ability to shape shift. He (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesAManInJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesAManInJapan">or she if you watch the English dub</a>) barely talks to anyone individually outside of Yamcha and, to a lesser extent, Oolong, resulting in having little to no chemistry with the other characters. Due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">decreased screen time and relevance</a> and his shape shifting powers becoming an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">Informed Ability</a> during the shift from <em>Dragon Ball</em> to <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>, Puar's only defining characteristic left was being Yamcha's friend.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>, Droy and Jet are defined entirely by being Levy's bodyguards/fanboys and probably being very weak. Some of the less important minion characters like Shou are little different, but at least have their own personalities.
</li><li> Chigusa Hanamura from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Free" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Free">Free!</a></em>. As a minor character, all that's known about her is that she's a good friend of Gou and Makoto compliments her looks in one episode.
<ul><li> Also, Nitori doesn't really serve any purpose other than to be Rin's roommate, look up to Rin, and worry about Rin. However, the season 1 ending montage that shows him hanging out with the others as well might signify that the next season will change this, and he's fairly popular in his own right even without that.
</li></ul></li><li> Sakura Kakei, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Team Mom</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetBackers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetBackers">Get Backers</a>,</em> is largely defined by her relationship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCracker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCracker">Makubex</a>, and rarely appears without him. And he's a minor supporting character himself (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy">Non-Action Guy</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">unable to exist outside of Mugenjou</span>).
</li><li> Yukari Akiyama of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em> is a tank <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku">otaku</a> whose primary defining characteristic is being an ardent fan of the protagonist, Miho Nishizumi.

The only things she ever does is have "silent conversations" with Yuki and play the nice girl for other people.
<ul><li> Also Kyon's Other Friend (Kunikida, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a>), at least in the anime series, who is mostly characterized as "That guy who hangs out with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Kyon</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Taniguchi</a>" (to the point that in the novels he says he mostly hangs out with Taniguchi so he will <em>have</em> some in-universe characterization). Taniguchi is a lesser example, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Kyon's</a> Only Sane Friend.

</li><li> Rin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em> is largely defined by her interactions with Sesshomaru.
</li><li> Nodoka Manabe of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn">K-On!</a></em>. Despite being a major supporting character who is given almost as much screentime as the five main girls, most of her character can be condensed down to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Yui's</a> childhood friend and nothing else.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">Hannah and Barbara</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LittleWitchAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LittleWitchAcademia">Little Witch Academia</a></em> are basically there to be lackeys/fangirls for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Diana</a> and are the most active in bullying Akko.
</li><li> Mitsune "Kitsune" Konno's role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina">Love Hina</a></em> mostly boils down to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTease">The Tease</a> and helping Keitaro understand <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Naru</a> better, since she's been Naru's best friend since middle school and frequently provides Keitaro with exposition regarding that, particularly Naru's crush on Seta. Sometime she plays the oldest voice of reason if Haruka isn't present, but that's about it. She is one of the only Hinata Inn girls who doesn't get a subplot of her own - even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">Mutsumi</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint">Sarah</a> get more storylines than her. Even the author regrets how underused Kitsune was.
</li><li> Ayano from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LuckyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LuckyStar">Lucky Star</a></em> is characterized as "That one girl who hangs out with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Kagami</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Misao</a>". In fact, she's so non-present, she's the only one of the ten main girls to have a boyfriend!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionGuidedBoomerang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionGuidedBoomerang">Sette</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>, whose entire personality revolved around her loyalty to her older sister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Tre</a>. This led to her becoming the only one of the younger <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Numbers</a> to be imprisoned along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Jail</a> and the older Numbers.
<ul><li> Partially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a>, since it's stated that she turned out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl">almost completely emotionless</a>, even compared to Otto and Deed.

Understandable in a series with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a> that some may be less noticeable than others, such as Yue's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool">magic school</a> class-mates or some of the mage teachers to the headmaster or each other.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox">Medaka Box</a></em>: Despite being the male lead, much of Zenkichi Hitoyoshi's role gets boiled down to being the titular character's loyal childhood friend.
</li><li> Michal, Lucia's love rival from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermaidMelodyPichiPichiPitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermaidMelodyPichiPichiPitch">Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch</a></em>, revolves almost completely around Kaito until she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">becomes Michel's mana battery.</span> In fact, she does this <em>intentionally</em>, thinking that being completely devoted to Kaito in every way will help her steal him from Lucia before he gets his memory back, while her brother Rihito worries about her well-being for it.
</li><li> Saikawa from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid">Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid</a></em> revolves almost completely around her best friend and crush Kanna. Justified since it's established that Kanna is her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend">Only Friend</a> and the rest of the recurring cast are adults (except for Shouta, but they never really interact).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedCharacterArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedCharacterArchetype">Deconstructed</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans">Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans</a></em> with the protagonist Mikazuki Augus. Mikazuki is largely defined by his relationship with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deuteragonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deuteragonist">Deuteragonist</a> Orga Itsuka, to the point where Mikazuki himself views himself as nothing more than a tool to exercise Orga's will. Several other characters note just how unsettling and self-destructive this is, and urge him to start thinking about himself and what <em>he</em> wants to do with his life. His response is always the same: "I'll just do what Orga tells me to do."
<ul><li> In the second season, we got Hush Middy, Tekkadan's new recruit. The earlier episodes portray as a potential rival to Mikazuki and has a backstory on how he joined Tekkadan in the first place. Later on, he decided to become Mikazuki's understudy, much to Mika's chagrin, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and carries him all around after he got paralyzed</span>. Then on the second to the last episode, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he got killed off lamenting that he couldn't catch up with Mika. What worse is that in the epilogue, his name is not even in the Tekkadan memorial</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Shizune is this to Tsunade. Downplayed in that it's more of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">Overshadowed by Awesome</a> thing—while she barely has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a> (she's the niece of Tsunade's ex-fiancé) or much development, at the very least she's enjoyable to watch on her own.
</li><li> Konan is one as well, as we don't know anything about her other than she uses paper as a weapon, likes to do origami, and that she followed Yahiko and Nagato around, fighting for the same goal as them. It pretty much becomes confirmed around Chapter 449 when she calmly tells Naruto that since Nagato believed in him, she'll also believe in him. <strong>Without showing any emotion whatsoever towards the person who made her friend kill himself.</strong>
<ul><li> Nagato himself was one to Yahiko in the backstory. For all that he's supposedly prohpecied to change the world, he spends all his time orbiting Yahiko, and tells Jiraiya that all he really wants to do is protect Yahiko and Konan. After they form the Akatsuki, Nagato becomes Yahiko's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">Lancer</a> and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Dragon</a>, dedicating himself to ensuring his friend's dream comes true. When Yahiko dies, and Nagato loses a planet around he snaps and becomes Pain...and is still trying to fulfill Yahiko's dream of a peaceful world, not so much because he cares, as because it was Yahiko's. Even after all this time, he's still chasing his friend's ghost.
</li></ul></li><li> Yamato was introduced into the series as being the substitute leader after Kakashi went out of commission. He was in the Anbu, was kidnapped and experimented on as an infant by Orochimaru, and is essentially the genetic clone of the most powerful shinobi who ever existed. On paper that sounds like one of the most interesting characters of the series. In actual practice? All Yamato has done in the series is help Kakashi train Naruto and play the straight man to Naruto and Killer B's antics.
</li><li> Despite being a main character, Sakura qualifies. She starts the series as Sasuke's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fangirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fangirl">Fangirl</a> and Naruto's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow">object of affection</a> and the most meaningful moments in her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> (outside of her friendship with Ino and asking Tsunade to train her) are...related only to the boys.
</li><li> Out of all the Konoha 12, Tenten has gotten the least amount of development. She has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyOneName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyOneName">no last name</a> and practically all of the development she ever gets is usually in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a> episodes in the anime. It seems as if she is just there to fill in the usual "two boys, one girl" most ninja squads tend to have and also display a cool fighting style.

<ul><li> Kyousuke Kamijou is a rare male-to-female example. His only purpose in the story is for Sayaka to wish to heal him in the hopes of winning him over, and his character can be summed up as "sad because disabled in accident" and "good with violin." He takes no actions of his own initiative in the story, and is mostly there as something for Sayaka to covet. He doesn't even make an effort to know her, which ends up factoring into Sayaka's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">eventual fate.</a> Consequently, he's often considered the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">least popular</a> character in the series.
</li><li> Kirika Kure, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PuellaMagiOrikoMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PuellaMagiOrikoMagica">Puella Magi Oriko Magica</a></em>, is an enforced example; her wish modified her personality to be a match for love interest Oriko Mikuni. At one point, she memorizes the names of a number of flowers to impress Oriko, but when Oriko informs her that it was her father who liked flowers, she deliberately erases the memory.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">original author admitted</a> Michiru was so unlike her she was difficult to write for, a trait carried over to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">original anime</a>. While her musical career is well-documented and she does occasionally interact with other people from time to time, the otherwise cryptic girl is largely defined by her interactions with Haruka, whom she usually appears alongside. Even an episode that shows how the two met is told from Haruka's perspective and doesn't explain that much of her life before Haruka meets her. In contrast, the fans liked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen">Haruka's personality</a> enough she got her own mini-arc and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory">Back Story</a> episode. Even so, Haruka only rarely appears in the series without Michiru (despite being better defined as a character) and most fans of one character are by default fans of the other.
<ul><li> Mamoru was always like this in the anime. The writers ran out of anything to do with him once he hit the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipCeiling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipCeiling">Relationship Ceiling</a>, and he promptly became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact">The Artifact</a>.

Mina, who has no role in the plot beyond being Maria's friend, and Gnosis, who is characterized as Belial's loyal servant that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquippableAlly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquippableAlly">doubles as her armor</a> and nothing else.
</li><li> Gopher from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em> lives to please his master, Noah. He is, however, not very competent and very jealous.
<ul><li> There's also Jacqueline, the weapon partner of the Kim, whose entire character is defined solely by her relationship with her meister and is rarely, if ever, in a scene without her. In the spin off, <em>Soul Eater Not</em>, she's allowed to flesh out a little bit more outside of being Kim's partner but overall her motivations and interests seem to always revolve around Kim.
</li><li> Also in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEaterNot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEaterNot">Soul Eater Not!</a></em>, there is Clay Sizemore who is the weapon partner to Akane.

Ruri suffers slightly less from this trope, as flashbacks show other facets of her character like her admiration of the protagonist Yuya's father and his entertainment dueling, friendship with a minor character, and implications that she was getting fed up with the aforementioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplarBigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplarBigBrother">Knight Templar Big Brother</a> Kurosaki controlling who she's around.

Willow does little except be Ebony's best friend, B'loody Mary is slightly more developed but her sole purpose is to agree with Ebony's goffikness, and Ron and Ginny have no characters at all, except to be concerned with Ebony. It makes you wonder why the author went to the trouble to concoct new names and backgrounds for them, and then ditch them from the plot. The guys in Tom Satan Bombadil's gang seem to stand out of their own right, though their lives seem to revolve round their band and goffik stuff. To give Tara Gilesbie credit, this is true to life.

<ul><li> Solid examples were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Roy Harper</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014">Wally West</a>, who in the comics were the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideKick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideKick">proteges</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeASonToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeASonToMe">adopted sons</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SidekickGraduationsStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SidekickGraduationsStick">successors</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">the lead characters</a>, Oliver Queen and Barry Allen respectfully. In the shows, they're introduced mostly as supporting characters of <em>other</em> supporting characters (Roy being introduced as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> of Oliver's sister and Wally introduced as the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLostSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLostSon">Long Lost Son</a> of the Joe West), and spent more time interacting with them then the characters they're meant to be the sidekick of. When they finally meet properly and eventually start their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHeroOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHeroOrigin">Super Hero Origin</a>, the shows had a nasty habit of keeping them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a>, skipping over their development, or putting them out of commission. Fans of the comics complained heavily, especially as the characters were being sidelined in favour of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Creator's Pet</a> characters. Eventually both characters got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnTheBus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnTheBus">Put On The Bus</a>; while Roy came back a few times and got to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale">Back for the Finale</a>, Wally briefly joined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow">a different show</a> where he got much more development, but was then written out as his actor was unsatisfied with the character's treatment.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCanary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCanary">Laurel Lance</a> was never very well treated, either. As she was demoted from being a kick-ass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> to a civilian love interest and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedDamsel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedDamsel">Designated Damsel</a>, she was out of the main plot focus and instead stuck in <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedByMountainLionsPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedByMountainLionsPlot">Trapped By Mountain Lions Plot</a> stories, similar to Thea (who was also this early on), she eventually got some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> and became an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>, but one who was <em>remarkably</em> off the mark from her comic self, and having long since lost her role as the love interest, she didn't even get to be a love interest, either. Eventually the show killed her off, and the fandom never quite forgave the writers for such a huge waste of a character.
</li><li> Jay Garrick and Jesse Quick, despite their prominent roles in the Flash mythos, ultimately got little to do in the show before they stopped appearing. In the comics, Jay was the original Flash and it was him who inspired Barry, but he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">Adapted Out</a> of the show in favour of using the newer retconned origin story of Barry's mother being murdered in his youth. When Jay was later introduced, they didn't have much to do with him and eventually he quietly left. Jesse Quick, meanwhile, was retooled by the show into the daughter of the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverseCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverseCounterpart">Alternate Universe Counterpart</a> of their former mentor Harrison Wells, rather than be the legacy of two golden age heroes who inherited their powers. Jesse spent most of the show as Harry's daughter and nothing more; any story she got was framed as how it affected <em>him</em> rather than herself (She wants to move out? It's so he can angst about his daughter leaving; She gets hurt? So he can be upset at her pain; She gains superpowers and wants to become a superhero? It's so he can worry about her safety before learning to let go; She starts dating Wally and wants to move in with him? It's so he can be upset his daughter is leaving him, etc), and she similarly stopped appearing after her actress got cast in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GodFriendedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GodFriendedMe">God Friended Me</a></em>. In-universe, this was all justified by Jay Garrick and Jesse being from alternate earths, so them showing up for friend stuff wasn't, exactly, something they could justify much, but the fact they <em>weren't</em> in the source material<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1k1kt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1k1kt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1k1kt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">mostly; Jay <em>was</em> depicted this way during the Silver Age and New 52 eras, but even during the former was still present for many team-ups and his own adventures; Jesse however was always a resident of the 'prime' earth</span> made this change all the more noticeable.

</li><li> His friend Devon was this even more so. Devon was the lead singer of their band, Dingoes Ate My Baby, and aside from very briefly dating Cordelia in his first appearance, his entire role in the show was to jam on stage with Oz during scenes set at the Bronze. In fact, after Oz left Sunnydale, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">it was never explained what happened to Devon or the other members of Dingoes Ate My Baby</a>, as they simply vanished without a trace.

<ul><li> Hazel became the butt of constant jokes among the fandom over how little she did. Depending on the episode, she's either a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpearCarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpearCarrier">Spear Carrier</a> or holding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanBall">Strawman Ball</a>. The problem was that she started out as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecurringCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecurringCharacter">Recurring Character</a>, received a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles">Promotion to Opening Titles</a> — and then received the exact same amount of screen time and plot relevance as before.
</li><li> Hazel <em>literally</em> has <em>one</em> character-centric episode (ironically, it was in the first season, <em>before</em> her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles">Promotion to Opening Titles</a>). The episode has to do with her not wanting to embrace her Somali Muslim ethnicity, and is a pretty interesting and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">topical</a> episode. Other than that, there are only a few other episodes that feature her prominently... interacting with Jimmy, Paige, and others in their far-more interesting problems.
</li><li> <em>Degrassi</em> is also prominent for having Satellite Characters that become members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Spotlight-Stealing Squad</a>. For instance, Manny Santos, who seemed to have set up camp in Emma's shadow in earlier seasons, finally busts out in Season 3 complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeAWhoreToGetYourMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeAWhoreToGetYourMan">Be a Whore to Get Your Man</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy">Teen Pregnancy</a>, and abortion storylines. And those are <em>just</em> in Season 3.
</li><li> And another more annoying example is Chantay Black, who somehow managed to be introduced in Season 4, do nothing for literally 4 seasons, be put in the title credits, and do a whole lot more of nothing before she begins dating Danny Van Zandt. The producers must feel really bad for the actress or something.
</li><li> Then of course there's Leia, who does pretty much nothing other than just existing (Coincidentally she also dated Danny Van Zandt). The fact that she just kind of appeared out of nowhere and was instantly shown in the opening credits makes it even more noticeable.
</li><li> In Season 7, Anya and Sav are in the story strictly to further drama between Mia and Holly J. While they have gotten better, they spend a lot more time as support to other plots then they do on their own plot.
</li><li> Blue was introduced as a love interest for Holly J in season 8, they break up in season 9, he leaves the show before season 10. Given his only interaction outside of Holly J was one episode with Riley and he didn't do much in it. Safe to say, when he leaves, nothing of value was lost.

</li><li> Ironically, <em>Tyrion</em> becomes this after he joins forces with Daenerys, as his own motivations wither down to just wanting her to be Queen because he thinks she'd be good at it, and pretty much all of Tyrion's storylines after the Season 5 are there to further Daenerys's goals.

After she's revealed to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> be a serial killer with a personality disorder</span>, her modus operandi in the game is pretty much being a creep to Togami and aggressively lusting after him. Even on rare occasions when she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> does revert back to Fukawa</span>, "her prince" Togami is still almost everything she talks about.

<ul><li> Quarr, an Imp who serves as a minion to various minor villains, gives us these sagelike words of advice: "The first thing you learn when you're my height is to find someone who's bigger to you and latch your lips firmly on their ass." Subverted in that he can come up with decent schemes on his own, and occasionally summon the odd demon who owes him a favor, but left completely to himself, he's capable of fighting V's bird to a draw and not much else.

</li><li> Trike Girl in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sinfest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sinfest">Sinfest</a></em> doesn't really do anything except show up to do something to oppose The Patriarchy.
<ul><li> Most new characters get their start this way, including Lil' E, all of the devil women, coffee shop lady, and others. Apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> being included in the benefits package makes entry-level Satellite Character work attractive at the comic.

Quick recap: a cutie mark is supposed to symbolize what a pony's special talent it. Silver Spoon's cutie mark in the MAS is <em>literally</em> a picture of Diamond Tiara, rubbing it in that she only exists as Diamond's friend/lackey.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Noob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Noob">Noob</a></em>, Decklan and Battos seem to exist only to fill in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">The Medic</a> spots in the Roxxor guild main roster. The novels state that they are both the leader of another guild as well as part of the top players, which is a status identical to Roxana who has been seen interacting with enough different people to stand on her own. They are seen pulling out weapons and using healing spells in the fights involving the team they form with Amaras and Roxana, but otherwise get little development other than always acting in accord with them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/SurvivalOfTheFittest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/SurvivalOfTheFittest">Survival of the Fittest</a></em> has Elizabeth Priestly, who plays the satellite to her twin brother, Lenny. Most of what she does consists of following Lenny around and angsting about his psychotic behavior.
</li><li> Another angry variant: in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse">Whateley Universe</a></em>, Tempest is pretty much defined by her massive hatred of Chaka (and by extension, all of Chaka's friends).

</li><li> Carmen is this to Alan, at least until Season 5s <em>The Best</em>.
</li><li> Jared is this to Clare.
</li><li> Louie is this to Jojo starting in Season 3.
</li><li> Mrs. Robinson was this to Mr. Robinson in the first, second, and third season.

Before this, she'd received a few solo cameos, but ever since the joke, her appearances have almost always been beside Paulina, the popular girl in question.
</li><li> Stacy and Tiffany from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em> were this in the first season; they essentially filled up the fashion club and served to either converse with Quinn or Sandi, the characters of real importance about matters related to their feelings or the plot. However, season two onwards saw more characterization with respects to Stacy, actually making her highly sympathetic.
<ul><li> Tiffany becomes an <em>inversion</em> as she actually becomes even more flat. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic">This... may be... duuue.... to the straaaange.... manner... of... speaking... thaat... her voice... actress... gave... her.</a>

Blob.
<ul><li> Urpgor similarly rarely leaves Viltheed and thus usually only interacts with the other villains. He branched out a little in later episodes however.
</li></ul></li><li> Jealous variant: Veronica from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em>, is Trixie Tang's satellite. She is in love with Timmy, and wishes that she could be Trixie, because Timmy likes Trixie.
</li><li> Depending on the episode in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop">Goof Troop</a></em>, occasionally PJ and Pistol will be little more than extra mouths to agree with Peg or Pete and will be treated as a single entity of "the kids". In most of these episodes, both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingYinYang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingYinYang">Sibling Yin-Yang</a> relationship and Pete's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalFavoritism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalFavoritism">Parental Favoritism</a> apparent in the rest of the series are removed, though there are a few that still hint at them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em>, Tyler the "Cute Biker" is hardly ever seen in any context besides cheering on Manly Dan. Later on, however, he gains his own storyline by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">becoming mayor of Gravity Falls.</span>
<ul><li> The same goes with Manly Dan's three sons; all they ever do when seen is cheer on their dad when he does something manly and join in on their dad's activities... we don't even know their names! The limited role of Dan and his boys seems rather strange when we start to realize that they're <em>Wendy's family.</em>

(He cannot talk because his asthma). After seeing various episodes, it becomes clear that Brainy is trying to propose to Helga, (confirmed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">book six of the series Hey Arnold!</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Arnold-Arnolds-Files-Groening-Bartlett/dp/0439381495/ref=pd_sim_b_3">Arnold's E-Files<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>).

The point is Brainy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself">with all his defects, is completely convinced he deserves to be loved and never gives up trying to propose</a>, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">Helga will deny her true feelings time and again</a>.

</li><li> Dukey from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyTest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyTest">Johnny Test</a></em>. Although he's ostensibly the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deuteragonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deuteragonist">Deuteragonist</a> of the show, he is rarely important to the plot and is mostly defined by his status as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> to the Test children, but even that almost never actually effects anything.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Madagascar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Madagascar">Madagascar</a></em> gives us King Julien's personal attendant Maurice. A voice of reason in the first film, that comes along with Julien when he joins the zoo animals in the sequels, where he becomes nothing but a guy who follows Julien around, only speaking up in agreement with whatever Julien says. By the third movie he is completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> as Julien is by himself for most of his plot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> Scootaloo started off this way. Due to the being the only Cutie Mark Crusader not related to one of the main characters, her appearances were limited mostly to those with Applebloom and Sweetie Belle. Later episodes subvert this by developing her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWorshipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWorshipper">Hero-Worshipper</a> status towards Rainbow Dash and with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS3E6SleeplessInPonyville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS3E6SleeplessInPonyville">episode</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">centered around her</a>.
</li><li> Silver Spoon is mainly one for Diamond Tiara. Diamond Tiara is in turn an angry variant for the CMCs, though she eventually gets some character development.
</li><li> Most of Shining Armor's personality is centered around his relationships with his sister Twilight Sparkle, his wife Cadance, and his child Flurry Heart. In the episodes he's appeared in he hasn't had a whole lot of development or displayed any particularly notable character flaws, and he basically begins and ends with "has relation to alicorn princess": he being the captain of the guards or the prince of a nation is rarely even mentioned, let alone touched on, and his defining abilities are more or less "isn't as powerful a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior">Barrier Warrior</a> as his wife" and "isn't as good a leader and planner as his sister" which just tends to mean he gets to be set up to fail against the threat one or both of them will ultimately succeed against. He gets a good bit in his focus comic book, however. Sparkle's Seven introduces a heretofore undeveloped competitive streak.
</li><li> Princess Cadance is about as bad, with no notable character flaws, background, or relationships other than Twilight, Shining, and Flurry Heart. If the episode doesn't focus on her interacting with one of them, she just sits in the background as the third princess. Like Shining, she's given more development in the comics with an entire issue devoted to her concern about this.
</li><li> Discussed in-universe with Big Macintosh, who for the longest time was merely "the brother" to his much more developed sisters and seldom even gets lines other than "eeyup". Then "Do Princesses Dream Of Magic Sheep" hints, and "Brotherhooves Social" confirms, that he actually feels this way himself and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeSpecial">doesn't feel special or valuable compared to his heroic sisters</a>. Since then he's gotten more characterization, such as his love of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawyerFriendlyCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawyerFriendlyCameo">Ogres And Oubliettes</a>, his friendship with Spike and Discord, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteLoveInterest">Satellite Love Interest</a> of his own in the form of Sugar Belle.
</li><li> That said, the only real development Sugar Belle has ever gotten is "is in a relationship with Big Macintosh", which is more than the rest of the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Equal Four</a>" have gotten, which is "are acquaintances of Starlight Glimmer".
</li><li> The last one in the line of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteLoveInterest">Satellite Love Interests</a> is Mudbriar. Since his entire character exists to give Maud a coltfriend who's just as weird as her, he resembles a flanderized version of Maud herself. Maud likes rocks and is stoic. Mudbriar likes sticks and is stoic. Maud is socially inept. Mudbriar is even more socially inept, constantly correcting people (which is his only character trait that is <em>somewhat</em> different from Maud).
</li></ul></li><li> High Five Ghost and Margaret of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow">Regular Show</a></em> seem only to exist to stand mostly silently next to Muscle Man and be the object of Mordecai's affections, respectively.
<ul><li> Interestingly enough, characters introduced as satellite characters to Margaret, such her dad Mr. Smith and Eileen, continued to appear after she left and had more character development.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>
<ul><li> Sanjay is this for Apu. This may be why he was eventually phased out.
</li><li> Janey, Lisa's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown">Ambiguously Brown</a> friend. She too was phased out.
</li><li> Superintendent Chalmers is this for Skinner, although he got an episode of his own in a recent season.
</li><li> Arnie Pye for Kent Brockman.
</li><li> Dolph for Jimbo and Kearney.
</li><li> Many of the male secondary characters' wives (notably Sarah Wiggum and Bernice Hibbert) only appear with their families or in scenes where a lot of women are present.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>, Dr. Mephesito's "friend" Kevin is a tiny, mute creature that silently follows him around everywhere but does nothing else. In one episode Chef becomes abruptly disturbed by Kevin, noticing him for the first time. Mephesito reacts dismissively.
</li><li> Karen is usually this to Plankton in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants">Spongebob Squarepants</a></em>, despite being a fully mobile computer device, usually working behind the curtains in one of his schemes. Only a few episodes have her come in contact with other main characters, and even then in a very limited manner.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleMindedTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleMindedTwins">Single Minded Friends</a> Katie and Sadie from are this for each other. Fanfics try to avert this (usually for shipping reasons), but the show's writers haven't given them a drop of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">development</a>. Even when Katie's elimination forcibly separated them for five episodes, the best the writers seemed able to think of was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">demoting Sadie to a silent extra</a> for most of them.
</li><li> Tyler for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainlessBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainlessBeauty">Lindsay</a> in the first season, where he barely gets any dialogue and only exists to provide some tension between Lindsay and Heather due to Lindsay dating someone on the other team. Luckily he receives some development in <em>World Tour</em> where he interacts a lot with his team, getting some memorable dialogue in the process.
</li><li> Cody's only purpose in Island was to be Gwen's creepy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessSuitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessSuitor">Hopeless Suitor</a>, after he does the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy">I Want My Beloved to Be Happy</a> shtick in <em>Island</em>, he gets eliminated. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews">In a very painful way</a>. Then along comes <em>World Tour</em> where his only purpose (in addition to the above) was to be the target of Sierra's unhealthy obsessions (which itself solely existed to make fun of Cody's real-life fangirls).
</li><li> Zoey is viewed as being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteLoveInterest">Satellite Love Interest</a> to Mike for most of <em>Revenge of the Island</em> and <em>All Stars</em>, this was subverted for three episodes where Zoey was away from Mike after he's eliminated, but quickly returned to it's original path. Mike's own arc in <em>Revenge</em> was largely centered around Zoey (even his shame about his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality">Split Personality</a> is largely because he doesn't want to freak her out), though in <em>All Stars</em> he does get extra conflict surrounding his evil alter Mal.
</li><li> Amy &amp; Samey in <em>Pahkitew Island</em> have no purpose other than their conflict with each other and every individual aspect about them as separate characters (such as Samey's friendship with Jasmine) still has something to do with their conflict with the other.
</li><li> Topher in <em>Pahkitew Island</em> has no purpose, other than to annoy Chris. Most other characters don't even seem to be aware he exists.
</li><li> Due to the spinoff series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramaPresentsTheRidonculousRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramaPresentsTheRidonculousRace">Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race</a></em> having a different structure from Total Drama, about half of the teams end suffering from this problem with the characters on a team most of the time interacting only with their partner and/or being on the show purely for their conflict. This becomes especially noticeable for teams that managed to make it more than halfway into the race despite their limited purpose or development:
<ul><li> The only reason why the LARPers (Leonard &amp; Tammy) are a team is just so that they can be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the first ones eliminated</span>. Further proven by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">confirmation</a> that Leonard was a last minute addition to the show to replace a magician character (which also lead to Tammy's creation since the magician would've been paired with an assistant).
</li><li> Fashion Bloggers (Tom &amp; Jen) are very similar to Topher in which they had no purpose and rarely interacted with any of the other characters or were even acknowledged.
</li><li> Mother &amp; Daughter (Kelly &amp; Taylor) were pretty much this show's answer to Amy &amp; Samey (to the point where Taylor's voiced by the same person who also did Amy &amp; Samey) in which they had very little purpose other than their unhealthy relationship with each other. The only conversations they ever had with others is Taylor being mean to the Adversity Twins, and in "Hello and Dubai" when Kelly has a conversation with Dwayne over her parenting, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which also happened to be the episode where she's eliminated</span>.
</li><li> Stepbrothers (Chet &amp; Lorenzo) were also kinda like Amy &amp; Samey where they had virtually no purpose other than to bicker and fight with each other, aside from the occasional one-time conversation with another character, or hanging with the Rockers in their elimination episode.
</li><li> The Rockers (Rock &amp; Spud) went through most of their run without interacting with any of the other characters. The only time they did interact with others was in their final episode where they both interacted with the Stepbrothers and Spud briefly interacted with Carrie.
</li><li> Just like with Mother &amp; Daughter and Stepbrothers, the Daters/<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Haters</span> (Stephanie &amp; Ryan) had virtually next to no reason for being in the game other than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> their extremely unhealthy and toxic relationship with each other.</span> The only other characters that they interact with are Stephanie with Kitty in "Hawaiian Honeyruin" and Ryan with Carrie in his last few episodes as part of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddFriendship">Odd Friendship</a>.
</li><li> The only purpose Best Friends (Carrie &amp; Devin) had to be on the show was their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue">long drawn out</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> plotline and as a result they ended up mostly being... There. The only notable interactions they had was both of them with Kitty &amp; Emma and Carrie's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddFriendship">Odd Friendship</a> with Ryan.
</li><li> The Surfer Dudes (Geoff &amp; Brody) never once had a major storyline and pretty much went through the race doing their own thing while being limited to the background most of the time. Very ironic since they ended up interacting the most characters out of their team and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> made it all the way to the finale</span>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Angry variant: Depth Charge, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em>, is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters">Ahab-esque</a> satellite character defined by his all-consuming <strong>hatred</strong> for the monstrous Rampage. It's heavily implied that Rampage caused this intentionally, making a point of destroying everything else Depth Charge ever cared about. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the end, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Depth Charge gives his life to end Rampage's</a>.</span>
<ul><li> In-universe, Inferno defines himself by his loyalty to Megatron, who he considers "The Royalty". However, this is more of a subversion in that this is because Inferno was somewhat uniquely damaged as a protoform, causing his personality to be heavily influenced by his ant beast mode. In practice, he ends up with a fair amount of personality, being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> (even by Predacon standards) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyroManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyroManiac">Pyromaniac</a>, whose loyalty to Megatron was hilariously over-the-top in contrast to, say, Scorpinok, who was implied to be loyal because he was just too dim to have his own agenda.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CreativeGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CreativeGalaxy">Creative Galaxy</a></em>, Epiphany's role is generally to hang floating around Arty, animating the Creative Spark rocket ship, repeating things that are said, and occasionally shapeshifting to reflect something that Arty is thinking or which is being talked about. About the only exception to this is in the second season story "Epiphany's Dino Dance / Epiphany and Eureka," in which Epiphany somehow suddenly becomes a full character, expressing her anger (in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdPersonPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdPersonPerson">third person</a>) after losing a game of spaceball, and playing with a friend named Eureka that looks just like her except for being blue instead of purple.
</li><li> The Vulture falls into this after his initial appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan">The Spectacular Spider Man</a></em>. Originally seeking revenge against Norman Osbourne for taking credit for his inventions, he eventually just becomes one of Doc Ock's lackeys.
</li><li> Casey Jones is a minor version of this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2012">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)</a></em>. His friendship with the turtles and April is his only real way into the plot because his traditional animosity towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Archenemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Archenemy">Hun and the Purple Dragons</a> is greatly downplayed this iteration.
