</div></div><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Our young hero has accomplished! Perhaps they have triumphed, perhaps they have decided to undertake a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>, perhaps they have proven worthy to respond to the Call.
</p><p>How can this be fittingly celebrated? Why, have them be told how proud people are of them!
</p><p>Normally this is said only by people who have reason to be proud: their parents, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mentors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mentors">their mentor</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamDad">Team Dad</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen">A Father to His Men</a>, etc. This is usually done for a young hero, whose skills might have been in doubt, and had unquestionably been formed by the person saying it. It may happen very early in the story, as proof that they are ready for the call, but is more common at the end to validate their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>.
</p><p>May also be a form of encouragement after a character has progressed a certain amount but is feeling discouraged.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>There is the form "I'm so proud of you." Or "We are so proud of you," if one can speak for more than one (such as a mother or father for both parents).
</p><p>Then there is the form "Your father would have been so proud of you." Normally addressed to fatherless heroes, though any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Disappeared Dad</a> may qualify them. May be spoken by the mother, or by any other mentor. They may not want, even in this moment, to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic">Not So Stoic</a> moment, and so distance themselves from the praise. They may be aware that the child <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">craves his father's approval, and would value this.</a> They may also not want to claim too much credit, since saying "I am so proud of you," implies that they have a reason to be proud.
</p><p>While "father" is the most common, "Your mother (or other figure) would be so proud of you," is also possible, in similar situations. "You should be proud of yourself" is another alternative, which ascribes even more of the credit to the person themselves.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>This is, in fact, what the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">"Well Done, Son!" Guy</a> craves, but the hero has not usually been striving with their eye on it, and the speaker is willing to tell them, freely.
</p><p>This trope can also be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> when the child does something despicable or even outright criminal, and the parent approves of their deviant behavior. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DotingParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DotingParent">Doting Parent</a> does this all the time, and gushingly so, which means the one they are so proud of is likely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazinglyEmbarrassingParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazinglyEmbarrassingParents">terribly embarrassed</a>. Alternatively, the trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTellMama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTellMama">Don't Tell Mama</a> exists because a crook wants to hear this and doesn't want their parents to be disappointed in them for taking up a life of crime.
</p><p>Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItHasBeenAnHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItHasBeenAnHonor">It Has Been an Honor</a>, where the character is usually addressing someone he has not formed, though he may have led him. Also contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappointedInYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappointedInYou">Disappointed in You</a>.
</p><p>See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourApprovalFillsMeWithShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourApprovalFillsMeWithShame">Your Approval Fills Me with Shame</a> for when they don't want this praise.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>:
<ul><li> After Shinji's first battle, Misato tells him that he did a noble thing and he should be proud, but he doesn't take it to heart due to the pain it caused him, the fact that he still thinks of her as a stranger, and getting punched by another kid in school.
</li><li> Later in the series, after another battle, his father tells him by speakerphone that he did a good job. He actually really takes it to heart and feels good about it.
</li><li> In the last episode Shinji <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">decides that he wants to be himself and to "stay here," the theatre scene disappears, and all the other characters congratulate him including Gendou and Yui</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em>. When Yuki rejects his mother's attempts at a parent-teacher conference to lay out his life for him, he says that he wants to become something <em>he</em> can be proud of.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>
<ul><li> There's a moment somewhat like this when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Naruto's father, the 4th Hokage,</span> is shown telling Naruto that he believes in him, that Konoha <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> can be rebuilt</span>, and he's counting on him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassTeacher">Iruka</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Umino</a> invokes this trope numerous times throughout the series, constantly praising and encouraging Naruto when everyone else ignored or mistreated him. During Naruto's battle with Pain, Iruka can be seen smiling with immense pride at everything Naruto has accomplished.
</li><li> It's even better when Naruto returns from a deadly battle with Pain and the ENTIRE VILLAGE—the vast majority of whom have hated him his entire life for something he didn't do—cheers his return. He also earns a hug from his crush, who previously considered him an annoying friend. That particular moment is lessened because Naruto did not hug her back, which, in retrospect, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">foreshadowed</a> what was to come <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking">nineteen chapters later</a></span>.
</li><li> It is revealed that before his death, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fugaku said that he was proud of Itachi, no matter what</span>. This same sentiment is carried over when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Itachi declares, no matter what Sasuke does, he will always love his younger brother</span>.
</li><li> Kakashi told his father he was proud of him, which also counts as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Forgiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Forgiveness">Forgiveness</a>. I'm pretty sure his dad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">returned the sentiment</a>.
</li><li> This is Kakashi's reaction when, during Team 7's final mission/battle together in the manga, Naruto, Sakura, and Sasuke <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">successfully pull off Kakashi's plan to defeat Kaguya, using absolutely flawless teamwork</span>.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><em>That was picture-perfect. Right now, the way you all are together...<strong>I love you.</strong></em>

<ul><li> And later, Goku says this to Gohan after the latter's full potential is unlocked.
<ul><li> He says it earlier in the series, right after everybody is sure that Cell is finally gone; "Gohan, I'm <em>so</em> proud of you!"

He directly acknowledges how far she's come and how strong she now is. She's so overwhelmed by Byakuya's acknowledgement, that her confidence is instantly restored, allowing her to thrash her opponent.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>, as Soichiro Yagami finally confirms <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">on his deathbed</span> that his son Light isn't the mass-murderer Kira. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">He is.</a></span>

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em> manga has a version of this for Wolfwood. But instead of a parent figure saying it, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the children of the orphanage throw confetti out of their escape ship to tell him "welcome home." They've realized that the brutal, cynical, hardass man who just killed himself to save them is not only one of them but is actually their beloved "big brother" who left them just a few years prior. He's maybe in his late teens and only looks (and fights) like a full-grown man because of artificial enhancements.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox">Medaka Box</a></em>, Medaka <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">briefly dies</span>, and her consciousness briefly awakens in a room where Anshin'in had meant to meet her at one time. There she finds <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the lost spirit of her mother, Hato Tsurubami. Tsurubami</span> tells her that she doesn't need to fight any more. Medaka, however, refuses to accept that, even after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her mother</span> asserts to her about the way the world is. Although she doesn't deny her logic, Medaka states that she'd rather question the way the world is rather than just accept the way it is, especially because of how much she loves people. After she leaves, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tsurubami</span> reflects on her own inability to continue fighting, and that there's only one thing that hasn't ever changed about her: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">how happy she was to have given birth to Medaka</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em>, Hana's mother, after a period of estrangement from her daughter over her doing tankery, comes to a flower exhibit that Hana put on, concedes that doing tankery enabled her to bring a new sense of personality to her flowers, and admits that while her methods are different, they are good on their own merits.

<div class="indent">"I  I don't believe that," Shinji brought up his head. "I won't forget about mother.

And also, "You are My beloved Son; with You I am well pleased."
</li><li> In the gospel of Matthew, in the Parable of the Talents, when two of the three servants who were given talents by their master came back and reported that they made double of what they were given, their master said, "Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful in a few things, you shall be ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord." This is contrasted with the third servant who was given only one talent, but didn't do anything with it except bury it and then return it to his master, to whom his master says, "You wicked and slothful servant, why didn't you leave it with the bankers so that I could have received back my own with interest?"
