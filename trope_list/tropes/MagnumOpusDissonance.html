<p></p><div class="indent"><em>"Her first book, labored over for years, and launched full of the high hopes and ambitious dreams of youth, floundered on its voyage, though the wreck continued to float long afterward, to the profit of the publisher at least. The hastily written story, sent away with no thought beyond the few dollars it might bring, sailed with a fair wind and a wise pilot at the helm into public favor, and came home heavily laden with an unexpected cargo of gold and glory."</em>
<div class="indent">— <strong>Louisa May Alcott</strong>'s vicarious description of her experience writing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleWomen">Little Women</a></em>, from <em>Jo's Boys</em>

</p><p>What happens when a writer or artist deliberately tries to create their <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnumOpus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnumOpus">Magnum Opus</a></em>? They slave over it for years, pouring 110% of their heart and soul and energy and sanity into it, and confidently expect it to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGoingToBeHuge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGoingToBeHuge">huge</a>, monumental, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBusting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBusting">Genre-Busting</a>, and assure them eternal fame and honor... and what is the response? At best, "Meh, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage">So Okay, It's Average</a>". At worst, "Wow, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/SoBadItsHorrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/SoBadItsHorrible">So Bad, It's Horrible</a>".
</p><p>But what happens when the same artist just writes or creates something for fun or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">profit</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualObligationProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualObligationProject">out of contractual obligation</a> with no big plans, hopes, or expectations for its success? Heck, they know it's not that good but figure it will at least pay the bills this month. They're so busy working on that inevitably earth-shattering <em>magnum opus</em>, they don't even give this other silly little project much thought. Whoever commissioned it is sure to be disappointed, but it's no big deal; the public won't even notice its existence enough to laugh at its pointlessness anyway.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Cue Situational <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">Irony</a>! That book, movie, or painting that the creator couldn't care less about becomes an instant sensation. They're hailed as a genius, worshipped for blessing the world with this wonderful new classic, immortalized in parodies and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Homage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Homage">homages</a>, and earn an eternal place in history for their brilliance and creativity. That masterpiece they had such high hopes for will quickly fade into obscurity, but they will be remembered and celebrated for this little hackwork forever.
</p><p>There are multiple causes behind this. Creators have different expectations and standards they apply to themselves than the audience and critics do; their definition of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnumOpus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnumOpus">Magnum Opus</a> might simply be the one that was the most perfect, smoothest, with the fewest hassles that went into making it. Some of them tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerfectionist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerfectionist">The Perfectionist</a>, and where audiences might forgive one or two mistakes or blemishes, the creator can't and will keep striving to achieve that ideal. Often, the author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWereTryingTooHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWereTryingTooHard">put so much pressure on themselves that it actually damaged the creative process</a>, whereas giving their creativity free-rein produced better results despite them paying less attention. Also, works intended to deliver a deep, profound, important message have a tendency to come across as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious-esque</a>, while works that are written without such concern end up focusing more on the story itself. This can also be related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneForTheMoneyOneForTheArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneForTheMoneyOneForTheArt">One for the Money; One for the Art</a>; after succeeding with a crowd-pleasing work, a lot of creators <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuteurLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuteurLicense">get to work on their masterpiece</a>, and said work may suffer from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors">Protection from Editors</a> due to a swollen ego or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a> due to the creator trying to get it just right.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Alternatively, writers are as human as the rest of us and, as individuals, can hold different opinions than their fanbase (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">or what they think</a> is their fanbase); this includes both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses">expectations of</a> audience experience and perceived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">aesop</a> importance/acceptance. In some cases, however, the author does indeed know better and over time the work of art they are proudest of might become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">Vindicated by History</a>.
</p><p>All of the above aside, this trope isn't necessarily as black and white as it sounds. As some of the examples below demonstrate, the opus can, in fact, have its own substantial fanbase and perfectly respectable sales and reviews...but it just ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">Overshadowed by Awesome</a> compared to the other works. Some fans may even <em>agree</em> with the author and prefer the opus to the author's other creations.

In fact, he banned another writer from his forum for suggesting that it was just a possible alternate future—not even that it was non-canon, just that it wasn't necessarily the One True Future. Most fans consider it to be one of the comic's biggest low points, as it had a <em>massive</em> amount of buildup making it out to be the fight of a lifetime, but its actual stakes and plotting were borderline nonexistent (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue">a big chunk of its twelve issues is the cast getting ready for a dinner party</a>) and the future versions of characters were just boring dads or housewives with boring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">Generation Xerox</a> kids.

What he got the most praise for, however, was <em>First Date</em> and <em>Last Date</em> whose combined length would still remain below novel size, comparing it with award-winning fics (the <em>Dates</em> were nominated, but never won anything), in one case even seeing <em>Last Date</em> on par with the legendary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GraphicNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GraphicNovel">Graphic Novel</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OfMiceAndMayhem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OfMiceAndMayhem">Of Mice and Mayhem</a></em> from the same fandom.

Specifically, he's made it clear that he believes that the chapters that made up 'Season 1' are the only good parts of the entire story since those are the ones that most closely adhered to his own personal vision of the story<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1x2b8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1x2b8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1x2b8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">he'd wanted it to be a 'behind-the-scenes-at-a-zoo' style story in the vein of an Animal Planet documentary that focused more exclusively on the adventures in the past and the difficulty of caring for the rescued prehistoric animals in modern times, and also for it to be a straight-laced story with a clear cut main protagonist for the entire story to revolve around while all other characters served exclusively as side characters to said protagonist's story</span>. Subsequently, he's also made no secret that he's since dismissed the two 'seasons' that followed as an open and shut case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">Seasonal Rot</a> due to him believing that this was the point where Nathanoraptor ruined his work by turning the story into a generic drama that just happened to be set at a zoo with prehistoric animals rescued via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a>, placing a disproportionate amount of focus on a bunch of 'side characters' to the point of making them a glorified <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Spotlight-Stealing Squad</a> to what he believed was supposed to be the main protagonist(s), making a mockery out of the character he created that was supposed to 'save' the story and bring his plans for it and the main protagonist back on track, prioritizing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenRomance">needless</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor">romances</a> and 'a dumbass mole plot' over actual development of the park, making the rescues and subsequent care of the prehistoric animals look too easy, making the story <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyCopiedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyCopiedItNowItSucks">too derivative</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorld">Jurassic World</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorldFallenKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorldFallenKingdom">Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</a></em>, maliciously dismissing any and all ideas he'd suggested to attempt to make the story better or bring it more in line with his original vision, and likewise reducing the whole thing to a piece of trash that he wishes he could forget ever having had any involvement in creating (and is even considering possibly rewriting so that there's a version of it that more closely matches up with the vision he originally had for it). Naturally, considering what trope this is the page for, it should be no surprise that the story's readers (and Nathanoraptor himself) have the complete opposite opinion<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2mr8m');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2mr8m" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2mr8m');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">specifically, they consider the 'phase 1' that Drew's so proud of to be a weak and aimless start, believe the supposed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">Seasonal Rot</a> flooded 'second and third seasons' to be the moment the story <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">grew the beard</a> and reached its full potential, found all the 'side characters' arguably more interesting than the 'main protagonist', largely considered the character he'd created for the sake of salvaging his original plans to be a flat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Creator's Pet</a> that instantly cemented herself as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">The Scrappy</a> precisely because of her creator's unsubtle efforts at forcing the readers to like her and the 'main protagonist' over all other characters in the story and substituting blatant rapid-fire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling">Character Shilling</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, and believed that Nathanoraptor's plans for the story to be a character driven drama that simultaneously deconstructed and satirized several staples of most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrehistoricPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrehistoricPark">Prehistoric Park</a></em> fanfiction stories and had more of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleCast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleCast">Ensemble Cast</a> style of character focus while still containing elements of the 'adventure in the past' and 'caring for the animals' story Drew had wished to have to be arguably more interesting and unique compared to the run-of-the-mill standard <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrehistoricPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrehistoricPark">Prehistoric Park</a></em> style documentary story that Drew Luczynski had wanted it to be. And furthermore, as Nathanoraptor himself has stated in his own comments in the retrospective, there were actually a few points where it was arguably writer!Drew's own fault that things didn't turn out the way he'd originally wanted</span>.

</li><li> Among all the films made within Walt's lifetime, it is said that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bambi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bambi">Bambi</a></em> was his favorite. Though the film is indeed quite acclaimed today, it was a box office failure upon its release (for the same reasons as <em>Pinocchio</em> and <em>Fantasia</em>) and even to this day, his first venture into feature-length animation <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a></em> is often considered his most iconic film.
</li><li> Walt himself intended both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty">Sleeping Beauty</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AliceInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AliceInWonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a></em> to be his joint magnum opus, but neither movie turned a profit during its initial box office release. In the case of <em>Alice</em>, Walt disliked the film even before it flopped due to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a> issues and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">regarded it as a mistake</a> for the rest of his life. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty">Sleeping Beauty</a></em>, at least, has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">Vindicated by History</a>.

Unfortunately for <em>The Black Cauldron</em>, management changed at Disney prior to its release and Jeffrey Katzenberg screwed the movie (claiming it was too dark and one big mess) and refused to give it any marketing or promotion. As such, at least initially, <em>Black Cauldron</em> flopped (and was all but officially disowned by Disney since it carried a PG rating, which, back then, was unheard-of for the family-friendly studio) while the more traditional <em>Great Mouse Detective</em> was a modest hit at the box office. Despite this, <em>The Black Cauldron</em> managed to become a bona fide cult hit in the following years.

By comparison, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994">The Lion King</a></em> was simply a filler project to tide things over for 1994. But <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994">The Lion King</a></em> became the mega-smash hit that would prove to be the financial pinnacle of Disney's Renaissance, while <em>Pocahontas</em> in 1995 became more of a let down that signaled the decline of the company's success.
</li><li> After floundering in the 2000s, it's clear they had high hopes <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePrincessAndTheFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePrincessAndTheFrog">The Princess and the Frog</a></em> would be the start of a Second Disney Renaissance (the first having been <em>The Little Mermaid</em>), releasing it amid a wave of publicity and hype regarding its protagonist Tiana, the first black Disney Princess. The movie did well, but, thanks at least partly to being released in an absolutely <em>brutal</em> winter season (<em>Avatar,</em> <em>Sherlock Holmes,</em> and the <em>Alvin and the Chipmunks</em> sequel were all released around the same time), it didn't do quite as well as Disney had hoped. The next two Disney Princess films, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tangled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tangled">Tangled</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013">Frozen</a></em> on the other hand, while not disliked, each spent a long time in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a> and dealt with heavy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3bkbi');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3bkbi" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3bkbi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The reason they aren't called <em>Rapunzel</em> and <em>The Snow Queen</em> is due to the perception that a fairy-tale title cut the mass appeal.</span> Despite that, they each did infinitely better at the box office and got the praise that <em>Frog</em> was aiming for. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise">Frozen especially so.</a></em>

That said <em>Make Way for Tomorrow</em> is highly prized and rated by cinephiles and film-makers like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnFord">John Ford</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeanRenoir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeanRenoir">Jean Renoir</a>, and Errol Morris.
</li><li> Out of all the actors to play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanForever">Val Kilmer</a> has never been very well-received. Many loved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989">Michael Keaton</a> and hated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanAndRobin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanAndRobin">George Clooney</a> but were really just indifferent to Kilmer, finding him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage">dull</a>. Despite this, Bob Kane considered Kilmer to be the best actor to play Batman. (Kane is widely reviled throughout the comics industry and fandom for stealing credit for creating Batman from Bill Finger and others though, so this is probably not the best indicator of quality.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertoBenigni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertoBenigni">Roberto Benigni</a> has stated in several interviews that he wanted to do his version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pinocchio2002" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pinocchio2002">Pinocchio (2002)</a></em> since he was a child. It was only after the success of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LifeIsBeautiful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LifeIsBeautiful">Life Is Beautiful</a></em> that he was given the freedom to pursue this project, which was poorly received.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuckerPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuckerPunch">Sucker Punch</a></em> was a pet project of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZackSnyder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZackSnyder">Zack Snyder</a> that he worked on for years. However, the final movie bombed at the box office and was panned by critics as his worst movie whereas his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DawnOfTheDead2004" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DawnOfTheDead2004">previous</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred">live-action</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Watchmen">movies</a> were critically praised.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulVerhoeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulVerhoeven">Paul Verhoeven</a> has stated that science fiction is not his favorite genre.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarlonBrando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarlonBrando">Marlon Brando</a> has stated his personal favorite movie that he worked on was <em>Burn!</em>. The film was a commercial failure when it originally came out. Later on in his career, despite garnering critical acclaim for his performance as Don Vito Corleone in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a></em>, he turned down his Oscar and didn't attend the ceremony.
</li><li> Crossing with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGoingToBeHuge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGoingToBeHuge">This Is Going to Be Huge</a>: Fox joined forces with Arthur P. Jacobs on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoctorDolittle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoctorDolittle">Doctor Dolittle</a></em>, considering that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorDolittle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorDolittle">best-seller adaptation</a> would be the start of a new franchise. It was a wretched <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a> that caused a heart attack on Jacobs, and upon release was badly received by audiences and critics alike. But on the other hand, as Jacobs finished the movie, Fox accepted to green-light an adaptation of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiGhetto">science fiction</a> novel he had the rights to given he kept the budget low. The result was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PlanetOfTheApes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PlanetOfTheApes">Planet of the Apes</a></em>, the first of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise">Cash Cow Franchise</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MNightShyamalan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MNightShyamalan">M.

All those Razzie Awards, critics, and fans of the animated series beg to differ, and the film instead ended up as the biggest flop in a series of poorly-received films that essentially torched Shyamalan's career. It took until the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheVisit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheVisit">The Visit</a></em>, the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WaywardPines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WaywardPines">Wayward Pines</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Split" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Split">Split</a></em> before his reputation was restored.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanleyKubrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanleyKubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a> regarded <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EyesWideShut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EyesWideShut">Eyes Wide Shut</a></em> his finest contribution to cinema. This is one of his only films that hasn't been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">Vindicated by History</a>. Yet <a class="urllink" href="http://gawker.com/205043/stanley-kubrick-may-have-seriously-considered-recasting-tom-cruise-in-eyes-wide-shut-2">other accounts<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> claim he considered it to be his worst.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgesMelies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgesMelies">Georges Méliès</a> insisted that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ATripToTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ATripToTheMoon">A Trip to the Moon</a></em> was by no means his greatest achievement, saying he was proudest of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsAngsty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsAngsty">serious, deliberately depressing</a> historical film called <em>Humanity Through the Ages</em>. Still, the former became an international success, contributed an iconic image to the history of film, and is still regarded as one of the most historically significant films of all time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WoodyAllen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WoodyAllen">Woody Allen</a> has stated he feels his films have only continued to improve as the years have passed, with the ones he puts out now being far better than his earlier work, a view most critics and many fans find difficult to agree with.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note43z1v');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note43z1v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note43z1v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For example, he considers <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MatchPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MatchPoint">Match Point</a></em> one of his best works, whereas veteran film critic Philip French of the UK <em>Observer</em> called it "extremely disappointing", criticizing the complete lack of humor, the "clumsy, lumbering dialogue" and Allen's lack of knowledge of the milieu he was writing about.</span> Allen has also expressed confusion with the underwhelming response to his film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HollywoodEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HollywoodEnding">Hollywood Ending</a></em>, which despite his usually withering opinion of his own work, he sees as one of his funniest films. He did, however, agree with the negative response to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCurseOfTheJadeScorpion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCurseOfTheJadeScorpion">The Curse of the Jade Scorpion</a></em>.
<ul><li> Allen has stated that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnnieHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnnieHall">Annie Hall</a></em> is not his favorite creation, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StardustMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StardustMemories">Stardust Memories</a></em> is. Fans have long come around to love the latter, but still think the former is his best film, if not <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Manhattan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Manhattan">Manhattan</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> With regard to his acting career, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan">Ronald Reagan</a> considered his finest performance to be in <em>King's Row</em> although most people remember him better for <em>Bedtime for Bonzo</em> or <em>Death Valley Days</em>. Despite this, <em>King's Row</em> did get Academy attention, and is considered a classic.
</li><li> Ishiro Honda considers his finest film to be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Matango" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Matango">Matango</a></em>, a film virtually unknown to all but Toho sci-fi fans.

Subverted in that those who have actually watched <em>Matango</em> usually consider it among his best works.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLean">David Lean</a> tends to be known for his small-scale but stylish early films (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GreatExpectations1946" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GreatExpectations1946">Great Expectations</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BriefEncounter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BriefEncounter">Brief Encounter</a></em>) or his later epics like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LawrenceOfArabia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LawrenceOfArabia">Lawrence of Arabia</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoctorZhivago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoctorZhivago">Doctor Zhivago</a></em>. His personal favorite was the comparatively obscure <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Summertime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Summertime">Summertime</a></em> (1955), starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatharineHepburn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatharineHepburn">Katharine Hepburn</a> and filmed in Venice.
</li><li> Bring up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackNicholson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackNicholson">Jack Nicholson</a> at a party these days and you'll most likely be hit with a reference to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShining">The Shining</a></em> or perhaps his turn as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989">Batman (1989)</a></em>, rather than any one of his <em>twelve</em> Oscar-nominated roles, the sole exception perhaps <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AFewGoodMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AFewGoodMen">A Few Good Men</a></em>, and even that's because of his "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">you can't handle the truth!</a>" outburst. He holds the record for most Academy-Award-nominated performances by a male actor, but how many "Jack Nicholson fans" even know what you're talking about when you say <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FiveEasyPieces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FiveEasyPieces">Five Easy Pieces</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastDetail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastDetail">The Last Detail</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Reds1981" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Reds1981">Reds</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TermsOfEndearment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TermsOfEndearment">Terms of Endearment</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrizzisHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrizzisHonor">Prizzi's Honor</a></em>?
<ul><li> One could argue that his first Oscar-winning role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OneFlewOverTheCuckoosNest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OneFlewOverTheCuckoosNest">One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</a></em> is well-remembered, and it is, but mostly by film buffs and psychology majors. The film is mostly remembered for Louise Fletcher's Nurse Ratched (used to make comparisons with any real-life uncaring medical professional) or is used to compare to real-life mental institutions.
</li><li> Of course, Nicholson's own favorite of all the films he made is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichelangeloAntonioni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichelangeloAntonioni">Michelangelo Antonioni</a>'s <em>The Passenger</em> (1975). He loved that movie so much he bought the negative, provided commentary for it on DVD, and later provided the director with a Lifetime Achievement Award. He calls it, "the adventure of my lifetime".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlPacino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlPacino">Al Pacino</a> has been nominated for eight Oscars over the course of his celebrated career, and while many of the roles he was nominated for (such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Serpico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Serpico">Serpico</a></em>) could absolutely be considered iconic, perhaps one of his more defining performances, Tony Montana in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scarface1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scarface1983">Scarface</a></em>, was not among them. Considering the line "say hello to my little friend" is generally one of the go-to lines for anyone trying to imitate Pacino, this is very surprising, especially when you realize that the films he <em>was</em> nominated for include <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DogDayAfternoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DogDayAfternoon">Dog Day Afternoon</a></em>, which hardly anyone but classic movie buffs even remember, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DickTracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DickTracy">Dick Tracy</a></em>, a literal live-action comic, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScentOfAWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScentOfAWoman">Scent of a Woman</a></em>, for which he won, despite his performance largely being a caricature of his 70s persona.
</li><li> In 1977, 20th Century Fox released two films that summer: One was <em>The Other Side of Midnight</em>, which was expected to be a huge hit thanks to being the adaptation of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOtherSideOfMidnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOtherSideOfMidnight">a bestselling book</a>. The other film? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">Some weird space-opera</a> from that guy who did <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanGraffiti" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanGraffiti">American Graffiti</a></em> and starring a bunch of nobodies and old out-of-work actors. The connection between the two was that if a movie theatre wanted a print of the former, they had to show the latter as well. The result? <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> became the highest-grossing movie ever for several years and became one of the most iconic moments of pop-culture ever made, while <em>The Other Side Of Midnight</em> was poorly-received and quickly forgotten.
</li><li> A lifelong fan of the novel, Richard Stanley's dream project was to make the most faithful adaption of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIslandOfDoctorMoreau" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIslandOfDoctorMoreau">The Island of Doctor Moreau</a></em> ever put on screen. Once his script was greenlit, Stanley, who had made his mark on low-budget indie films, was quickly overwhelmed working on a Hollywood-scale project, and by trying to direct the increasingly difficult <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ValKilmer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ValKilmer">Val Kilmer</a>. Stanley was fired from the production before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarlonBrando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarlonBrando">Marlon Brando</a> had even arrived on set, and the replacement director, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnFrankenheimer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnFrankenheimer">John Frankenheimer</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">didn't fare</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb">much better.</a> Stanley was so burned by the experience he didn't make another (short) film until 2011.
</li><li> While most viewers would argue that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/QuentinTarantino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/QuentinTarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a>'s best work is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction">Pulp Fiction</a></em>, and pretty much everyone will agree it is his signature film, there's a pretty big hint in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InglouriousBasterds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InglouriousBasterds">Inglourious Basterds</a></em> that he considers <em>that</em> to be his magnum opus. Specifically, the film ends with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a character (who was originally going to be played by Tarantino) looking directly at the camera and saying "I think this might be my masterpiece."</span> That being said, there are some people who agree with Tarantino, and even those who put <em>Pulp Fiction</em> in first will often cite <em>Basterds</em> as the runner up.

</li><li> While it's hard to call anything made by Herschell "the Godfather of Gore" Gordon Lewis an opus, he considers <em>A Taste of Blood</em> to be his best film, though ironically it's usually seen as one of his worst. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BloodFeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BloodFeast">Blood Feast</a></em> is his most well-known, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandManiacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandManiacs">Two Thousand Maniacs!</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfGore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfGore">The Wizard of Gore</a></em> are generally seen as his best.
</li><li> The Italian film <em>Youth</em>, which is set in a Swiss pension, has 2 in-universe examples.
<ul><li> One is with a side character which is a retired actor. He had a few big and dramatic roles throughout his lifetime, but he is only well-known for his role in a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">robot</a> movies. He was surprised to hear of a girl that she knows him from his favorite acting role.
<ul><li> The very same actor also thinks that <em>Simple Songs</em> is this for the main character (a composer), but it turns out that the main character thinks rather highly of it as he has written the music because it allows his wife to sing something.
</li></ul></li><li> The other of the 2 main characters (a film director) thought of a certain actress that he found on the streets that he trained to become one of the truly greatest actresses of the world as his biggest achievement. By the end of the film, it is revealed that the actress barely cared about her life with him, saying that she found her own hard work on the streets to learn how to act well prior to joining him more admirable than the pure carelessness that the film director had for her during the time when she was an actor under his thumb.

However, Chan feels that the comparatively obscure <em>Police Story</em> is his best.

Her reaction was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatWhat">Flat "What"</a> (as the movie is a major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a> for her).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErrolFlynn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErrolFlynn">Errol Flynn</a> was best known for starring in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Swashbuckler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Swashbuckler">Swashbucklers</a>, yet his personal favorite film of his own was the boxing picture <em>Gentleman Jim</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnFord">John Ford</a>'s famous films in his lifetime were <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheQuietMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheQuietMan">The Quiet Man</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HowGreenWasMyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HowGreenWasMyValley">How Green Was My Valley</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGrapesOfWrath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGrapesOfWrath">The Grapes of Wrath</a></em>, <em>The Informer</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stagecoach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stagecoach">Stagecoach</a></em>. Critics would cite <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoungMrLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoungMrLincoln">Young Mr. Lincoln</a></em>. Later generations of film-makers and audiences cited <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSearchers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSearchers">The Searchers</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWhoShotLibertyValance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWhoShotLibertyValance">The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance</a></em>. What were Ford's favorites?
<ul><li> <em>Wagon Master</em> which he described as "the purest, simplest Western I ever made." A rare title that Lindsay Anderson called "the first avant-garde Western" citing its unconventional use of music, gorgeous composition and minimalist storyline and its plot of multiple characters with no real central figure.
</li><li> <em>The Sun Shines Bright</em> which despite its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, he felt was a film he achieved what he wanted to. Another obscure title.
</li><li> Even more extreme is <em>The Fugitive</em>, his 1947 adaptation of Graham Greene's novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePowerAndTheGlory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePowerAndTheGlory">The Power and the Glory</a></em>.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherLee">Christopher Lee</a> was best known for playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula">Dracula</a>, but he felt that the best <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HammerHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HammerHorror">Hammer Horror</a> he made was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDevilRidesOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDevilRidesOut">The Devil Rides Out</a></em>, and his favorite role was Lord Summersisle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWickerMan1973" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWickerMan1973">The Wicker Man (1973)</a></em>.

Instead, what happened was essentially the opposite — <em>Lost in Translation</em> was a smash hit that got Coppola an Academy Award for Best Screenplay, while <em>Marie Antoinette</em> proved a critical and commercial bomb — and the resulting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtistDisillusionment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtistDisillusionment">Artist Disillusionment</a> that Coppola felt was enough for her to swear off making films for mainstream audiences, focusing mostly on indie productions and reportedly only agreeing to make the Netflix special <em>A Very Murray Christmas</em> as a personal favor to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillMurray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillMurray">Bill Murray</a>.
</li><li> In her later years, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IngridBergman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IngridBergman">Ingrid Bergman</a> admitted to being somewhat rankled that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Casablanca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Casablanca">Casablanca</a></em> ("an assembly-line wartime propaganda picture") came to eclipse her more "important" and artistic films with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock">Hitchcock</a> and Rossellini, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AutumnSonata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AutumnSonata">her collaboration</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IngmarBergman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IngmarBergman">Ingmar Bergman</a>, among others; in her own words, all people ever wanted to talk about was "that one with Bogart".

<ul><li> Speaking of Brooke, the movie where she got her first starring role, and the only one she enjoyed during filming, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrettyBaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrettyBaby">Pretty Baby</a></em> is not considered among <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LouisMalle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LouisMalle">Louis Malle</a>s best works. Malle never considered in his lifetime <em>Pretty Baby</em> his finest film, it was just a filler film between <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackMoon">Black Moon</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AtlanticCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AtlanticCity">Atlantic City</a></em>, and, as a result, was left out of a Blu-ray retrospective of the director's filmography.

The result: <em>Grease</em> was the year's highest-grossing movie and a pop-culture event, while <em>Pretty Baby</em> was poorly received and quickly forgotten.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> wrote <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> merely in accordance with popular demand for a sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em> - his true labor of love was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em>, which he spent essentially his entire adult life writing and which he was still polishing and rewriting when he died. In fact, he initially advanced the <em>The Silmarillion</em> for publishing instead and only wrote <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> when he was told his Elvish History would not ever be published. Downplayed in that, despite using it as a backstory for his published novels, he never really intended <em>The Silmarillion</em> to be published in his later life - writing it was just a leisure activity for him.
<ul><li> However, his youngest son Christopher Tolkien has stated in an interview that he personally does not believe this viewpoint. His belief was his father always intended to finish <em>The Silmarillion</em> but time caught up with him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em> was written as a story for Tolkien's children, therefore he tried to make it good enough that his children would truly enjoy it. Meanwhile, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> was written as commissioned by Tolkien's agent as a followup. Despite this, the latter is more well-known and more often referenced.
</li><li> On top of this, there is also the fact that Tolkien was a well-respected professor of philology at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Oxbridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Oxbridge">Oxford</a>, and while he can hardly be counted as a prolific academic writer, he did write a number of very influential academic works. These include definitive Modern English translations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SirGawainAndTheGreenKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SirGawainAndTheGreenKnight">Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beowulf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beowulf">Beowulf</a></em>, along with a very spirited defense of the literary value of Anglo-Saxon poetry and a dictionary of Middle English, each of which could be considered a <em>magnum opus</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame">Ender's Game</a></em> was originally just another short story that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonScottCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonScottCard">Orson Scott Card</a> wrote to pay the bills.

While <em>Speaker</em> is certainly well-regarded among sci-fi aficionados, <em>Ender's Game</em> has become one of the most widely read sci-fi novels of all time, is required reading in many middle schools, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EndersGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EndersGame">received a film adaptation</a>.

But in terms of actual literary merit, Gibson considers it one of his weakest works (keep in mind, it was his first novel). Compared to his later novels, its characterization is minimal and the plot is very straightforward.

At one point, he claimed, "I like <em>Joan of Arc</em> best of all my books; and it is the best; I know it perfectly well. And besides, it furnished me seven times the pleasure afforded me by any of the others; twelve years of preparation, and two years of writing. The others needed no preparation and got none."

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> apparently thought more of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheRapeOfLucrece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheRapeOfLucrece">The Rape Of Lucrece</a></em> than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/KingLear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/KingLear">King Lear</a></em>. This is largely due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>; at the time, epic poetry was considered the highest form of literary art; plays, on the other hand, were seen as lowest-common-denominator trivialities. Today, of course, his plays are better known than his (still great) poetry.

In time, many of them thought that this failure pretty much invalidated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Romanticism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Romanticism">Romanticism</a>. When worrying over how posterity would judge them, they never seemed to think their lyric poetry could count for much.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber">David Weber</a> is famous for his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> books, while his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Safehold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Safehold">Safehold</a></em> books are being considered the critically preferred work. But it's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarGods">The War Gods</a></em> that's his favorite, and he's described what he's written so far as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em> in that series to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, and states that work will be the one that lasts.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a>:
<ul><li> When most people think of him, they think of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShining">The Shining</a></em>. And while <em>The Shining</em> was indeed a very personal work to King (it being a metaphor for King's own alcoholism) he has gone on record stating that he feels <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PetSematary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PetSematary">Pet Sematary</a></em> was the scariest novel he ever wrote.
</li><li> Most people only know <em>The Shining</em> because of the film, not the book (<em>It</em> would fall into a similar category). King himself would probably consider <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkTower">The Dark Tower</a></em> to be his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnumOpus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnumOpus">Magnum Opus</a>, a truly huge, multi-volume work that literally took him years to write (and he notably made a point to finish after he nearly died). However, most literary critics, King fans, and even King himself in the forewords of some of his books, would hold <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStand">The Stand</a></em> to be his single best work.

</li><li> This arguably applies to the whole of Lovecraft's work: While he's considered to be one of the greatest American horror writers, he considered himself to be mediocre at best. (He was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanboy">Ascended Fanboy</a> of Robert W. Chambers.) For example, he had <em>this</em> to say about his writing:
<div class="indent"> I have no illusions concerning the precarious status of my tales, and do not expect to become a serious competitor of my favorite weird authors - Poe, Arthur Machen, Dunsany, Algernon Blackwood, Walter de la Mare, and Montague Rhodes James. The only thing I can say in favor of my work is its sincerity.

Eliot</a> and the author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenryJames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenryJames">Henry James</a> thought their real destiny lay in writing for the theatre. Unfortunately, James was not a particularly good dramatist, and while Eliot did write some well-known plays (such as <em>Murder in the Cathedral</em>), none have reached the fame of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWasteLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWasteLand">The Waste Land</a></em> or "Prufrock".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnthonyBurgess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnthonyBurgess">Anthony Burgess</a> resents that he's best known for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AClockworkOrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AClockworkOrange">A Clockwork Orange</a></em>, which he thought shallow compared to his other works.

</li><li> While Mario Puzo is known for his novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a></em>, which was a smash hit in the 1970s and turned into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather">even more popular film</a>, Puzo always considered his earlier novel <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFortunatePilgrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFortunatePilgrim">The Fortunate Pilgrim</a></em> to be his best. It's perhaps fitting that people generally remember the original <em>The Godfather</em> book as a fairly pulpy story compared to its adaptation.

</li><li> Cecil Day-Lewis (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielDayLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielDayLewis">Daniel</a>'s father) was Poet Laureate in the UK and wrote a lot of serious poetry and verse drama, but he also wrote detective novels to pay the bills. Particularly in the 50s and 60s he was far better known for the detective books (written under the name Nicholas Blake), some of which were adapted for film and TV. His poetry was never the equal of contemporaries like Auden or Larkin and is now largely forgotten, but his detective novels are still regarded as classics by some.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipLarkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipLarkin">Philip Larkin</a>, meanwhile, wanted to be a novelist rather than a poet. His two novels are read only by a few academics, but his poetry remains popular, acclaimed, and even quoted (even if his most-quoted poem is mainly so because of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb">Cluster F-Bomb</a>).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesPerrault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesPerrault">Charles Perrault</a> published writings and essays about art that have mostly been forgotten centuries later. But the work he is still most famous for, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyTales">Fairy Tales</a>, are still popular today and indeed do much to define those that are in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools">Small Reference Pools</a>. Ironically enough Perrault felt ashamed about these childish stories and published them under his son's name.
</li><li> Same holds for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrothersGrimm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrothersGrimm">Brothers Grimm</a>, who considered their work on historical linguistics their greatest achievement.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThomasHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThomasHardy">Thomas Hardy</a> considered <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JudeTheObscure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JudeTheObscure">Jude the Obscure</a></em> his favorite and best novel.

Subsequent scholars (and readers) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">have taken Hardy's side</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarRiceBurroughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarRiceBurroughs">Edgar Rice Burroughs</a> considered <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnCarterOfMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnCarterOfMars">John Carter of Mars</a></em> stories to be his best works. They are rather obscure compared to his other series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Tarzan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Tarzan">Tarzan</a></em>. One need only look at Burroughs's Hollywood legacy. <em>Tarzan</em> has been adapted countless times since the days of silent movies, and has been an enormously successful property, while the film adaptation of <em>John Carter</em> spent <em>81 years</em> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a>, was completed by Disney in 2012 and promptly bombed in a rather spectacular way.
</li><li> Pyotr Pavlovich Yershov wrote dozens of poems, plenty of stories, and considered them to be much better than some fairy-tale poem he wrote in simpleton language when he was young. Except that today, the poems and stories are all but forgotten, while <em>The Little Humpbacked Horse</em> earned him a statue for <em>composing a folk tale</em>.

But Cervantes had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitCreatorDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitCreatorDisorder">Attention Deficit Creator Disorder</a> and wanted to write a lot of projects that would bring him glory, like Los trabajos de Persiles y Segismunda. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedyGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedyGhetto">No one took the comedy book seriously, not even Cervantes.</a> Maybe that continuation would have never seen the light of day if not for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanfiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanfiction">fanfiction</a> writer that wrote himself the second part, doing the worst insult you can do to an author: A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixFic">Fix Fic</a>, because Cervantes wrote some characters deserving of a better writer. Cervantes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBetterSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBetterSequel">decided to write the best second part he could</a>, and so we have now <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote">Don Quixote</a></em>.
</li><li> Doctor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurConanDoyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurConanDoyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a> created a detective character based on an old medical professor whose techniques and insight had always impressed him in order to pay the bills while he worked on the historical epics he loved so much and which he was sure would make his name and reputation as a writer and artist. Unfortunately for Conan Doyle, the detective character was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a></em>, who became one of the most iconic characters of all time, while Doyle's historical dramas, which he much preferred, are largely forgotten. Doyle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">was not happy about this</a> (he even tried killing Holmes off at one point, but fan backlash forced him to do an about-face).

Then, his big problem with Screwtape was that it, alone among his works, was actively unpleasant to write. Another one of Lewis' favorite books that he wrote is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Perelandra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Perelandra">Perelandra</a></em>, which he once said was worth ten 'Screwtapes'.

It was instead put on the web, and only after gaining popularity, did he decide to start writing follow on volumes. SAO eventually got so big it was actually published to paperback in 2009 and is now 11 volumes and still going, with a Manga, Anime, and Video Game adaptation plus a huge fanbase.
</li><li> Neil Munro considered himself an author of historical novels, his <em>Para Handy</em> stories being something he wrote to pay the bills. A hundred years later, the <em>Para Handy</em> stories are still well-loved Scottish literature and have been adapted several times. Fans might also be familiar with his other humorous stories, <em>Erchie, My Droll Friend</em> and <em>Jimmy Swan.</em> The historical novels are mostly known as "that thing Munro did that wasn't as good as <em>Para Handy</em>."

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HermanMelville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HermanMelville">Herman Melville</a> had a very strange relationship with this phenomenon:
<ul><li> During his own lifetime, Melville was really only respected for his first two books, <em>Typee</em> and <em>Omoo</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory">quasi-biographical</a> adventure stories based on his own experience in the South Pacific. These two works are now only taught in dedicated Melville classes, and towards the end of his career, with no knowledge of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobyDick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobyDick">Moby-Dick</a></em> coming down the road, he expressed regret that he would be forever known as "the man who lived among the cannibals."
</li><li> Melville's first serious attempt at great fiction was <em>Mardi</em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyWaysideTribe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyWaysideTribe">Wacky Wayside Tribe</a>-laden adventure story bogged down with snarling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemplateOurNavels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemplateOurNavels">philosophical tangents</a>, a protagonist who up and disappears for two-thirds of the novel, and an open ending. Despite all this, he called <em>Mardi</em> his "child of many prayers" and hoped it would blow audiences away. It was blasted by critics for all of this and for being very different from his first two novels; modern scholars often consider it the only outright <strong>bad</strong> thing he wrote.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobyDick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobyDick">Moby-Dick</a></em> is, of course, Melville's most famous novel, and as with <em>Mardi</em> he set out intentionally to write a great work - calling it this time a "mighty book on a mighty theme." While <em>Moby-Dick</em> is now one of the fixtures in the canon, it was very poorly received and called blasphemous by the press of the day. Though Melville anticipated the controversy, he told Nathaniel Hawthorne in a letter that he had written "a very evil book". On top of that, Melville actually <em>thought he could write an even better novel</em>, and only gave up that notion after <em>Moby-Dick</em> failed. Though the books after that, <em>Pierre; or the Ambiguities</em>, <em>The Confidence-Man: His Masquerade</em> and his posthumous work, <em>Billy Budd</em> are regarded among his best writings today.

By the fourth and fifth books his introductions become pleas to his fans to allow him to write anything else. After the sixth book he finally tried to quit, and began a new series which he considered his best work. After two books, <em>The Sea Faries</em> and <em>Sky Island</em>, it became clear that the series was a flop, and with his mounting financial troubles, Baum would have to return to the Oz series to pay the bills. He would work on the series until his death. As an aside, his favorite Oz book was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScarecrowOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScarecrowOfOz">The Scarecrow of Oz</a></em>, perhaps because it includes the main characters from his other failed series and almost acts as a suitable conclusion to the series.

He aspired to be a major movie star and considered his TV work as just a means of getting some media exposure so he'd have a nice resume when casting directors started looking him up for their films. However, when he read the script for the very first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966">Batman (1966)</a></em> episode, he became so enthusiastic about that project that he accepted the role of Bruce Wayne immediately, and even up until his death continued to be proud of his <em>Batman</em> work. However, it made him unhappy that the style of the 1960s show is often misunderstood, and that very few people give him the credit he thinks he deserves for reviving the character's popularity (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Bruce Timm</a> is one of the few that does, as evidenced by "Beware the Gray Ghost".) At the same time, West's big movie career never materialized, but he was pleased with his extensive TV work over the past half-century.

He also felt the concept started to get stale after a few seasons, which is why he left after the third one. One of the sketches he's particularly remembered for is the fan favorite "The Ministry of Silly Walks", yet according to the book "The Pythons", he never liked it all. He called it a very "ordinary sketch" and he even took legal action to prevent a sculptor from making a statue of him in the Silly Walk pose. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieAnotherDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieAnotherDay">Die Another Day</a></em> folks slipped one in anyway.

On the other hand, Chappelle loved doing stand-up, regarding it as the most important part of his creative work. One of the many factors relating to his retreating from the show was that its popularity was starting to interfere with his ability to do stand-up; when at a show, his material was drowned out by the crowd chanting "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RickJames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RickJames">Rick James</a>," causing him to call his own audience idiots.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a>'s entire career is rife with this, with the songs he wrote for art generally not as well known as those he wrote for commerce (though there are exceptions: "'Heroes'" may not have been a hit when it was <em>new</em> but is now a candidate for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong">Signature Song</a>). However, the first and biggest example for him would be a little song he slapped together out of boredom... he was actually embarrassed by it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SpaceOddity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SpaceOddity">"Space Oddity"</a>, his first hit - and still popular to this day.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a> was the undisputed King of Rock. But he never wanted to be. He wanted to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GospelMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GospelMusic">Gospel Music</a> singer. His heroes growing up were people like Jake Hess, James Blackwood or JD Sumner, names you've probably never heard of. Before he was anybody, he auditioned to sing with a southern gospel quartet, but was told to stick to driving trucks because "you can't sing a lick." This is likely what led Elvis to sing whatever songs would get people to listen, and thus he became the Elvis that everyone knew. Once his career had reached such heights that he could do whatever he wanted, he began recording albums like <em>Peace in the Valley</em>, <em>His Hand In Mine</em>, <em>How Great Thou Art</em> and <em>He Touched Me</em>. He also began touring with southern gospel quartets, including JD Sumner and the Stamps, the Imperials (no, not Little Anthony's group) and the Jordanaires. He considered his gospel albums to be the greatest thing he'd ever done, as opposed to "Hound Dog", "Love Me Tender", "All Shook Up" or "Jailhouse Rock". It's doubtful most Elvis fans think the same. (Though the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences did; all of Elvis' competitive Grammy wins came in the Gospel category.) Similarly, the world heralded Elvis as "The King of Rock 'n' Roll" or just "The King". As far as Elvis was concerned, "The King" was Jesus and "The King of Rock 'n' Roll" was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FatsDomino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FatsDomino">Fats Domino</a>, and he resented the fact that he was more popular than Domino just because he was white.

In response, Sabbath cranked out "Paranoid" in only five minutes. And what became of this rushed, forgettable, slipshod song? Not only was the entire album renamed after it, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Paranoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Paranoid">Paranoid</a></em>, not only did said album become their most successful of all, but "Paranoid" the song became one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath">Black Sabbath</a>'s highest-charting hits!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanMorrison">Van Morrison</a> does not consider "Brown-Eyed Girl" to be among his best songs.

Their next single, "Jennifer Eccles", a lightweight pop number they pretty much wrote as a joke, became a huge hit. Nash was not pleased.
<ul><li> According to interviews, this <em>kept on</em> happening, with the band alternating between flops they put their heart and soul into, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyLoveSongs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyLoveSongs">Silly Love Songs</a> dashed off in five minutes that became big hits. Needless to say, this wasn't encouraging to the band.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GustavHolst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GustavHolst">Gustav Holst</a>'s <em>The Planets</em> is the most popular of his works, however, the composer did not count it as one of his best. Further, Holst's favorite movement of <em>The Planets</em> was "Saturn," but it's usually "Mars" or "Jupiter" that are the most popular with audiences.
</li><li> Rivers Cuomo of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Weezer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Weezer">Weezer</a> stated for a long time that he was embarrassed by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pinkerton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pinkerton">Pinkerton</a></em>, typically considered to be the band's finest moment. However, as with Morrison and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AstralWeeks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AstralWeeks">Astral Weeks</a></em>, he warmed to it in later years.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses">Guns N' Roses</a> created "Sweet Child O'Mine" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AppetiteForDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AppetiteForDestruction">Appetite for Destruction</a></em> as basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlbumFiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlbumFiller">just a song to fill space on the album</a>. It wasn't expected to do particularly well. Now, it is quite possibly their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong">Signature Song</a>. Particularly Slash, who mindlessly came up with tune's main guitar riff as he was warming up, and the rest of the band thought it was so good they had to build a song around it.
<ul><li> The song is so popular amongst fans, that despite Slash publicly saying he hates the song, he still played it every night on his solo-tours, simply because the fans wanted to hear it.
</li><li> When "Sweet Child O' Mine" was voted 8th best guitar riff of all time, Slash also commented that that song shouldn't even be on the list, and that other Guns N' Roses-songs would be better qualified. Clearly, the fans disagree.
</li></ul></li><li> At one point, Glenn Hughes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeepPurple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeepPurple">Deep Purple</a> has stated he never thought very highly of the song "Burn", claiming that he found the "Couldn't believe she was Devil's Sperm"-line disturbing, and that he liked "Stormbringer" a lot more. The fans, however, generally rate "Burn" as one of Deep Purple's best songs, while the entire <em>Stormbringer</em> album is more or less ignored, with "Soldier Of Fortune" being the main exception.
<ul><li> Nobody in the band seems to hold a particularly high opinion of the legendary "Smoke on the Water", with guitarist Ritchie Blackmore in particular considering it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage">So Okay, It's Average</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain">Kurt Cobain</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana">Nirvana</a> didn't think much of "Smells Like Teen Spirit", describing it as "my attempt at writing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePixies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePixies">Pixies</a> song." In fact, he didn't like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nevermind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nevermind">Nevermind</a></em> much as a whole, thinking the whole album sounded much too polished. One of the exceptions, however, was "Drain You", which he always thought was one of Nirvana's best songs, and couldn't understand why it was never the hit he thought it should have been.
</li><li> Scott Joplin had a good career writing light ragtime and other entertainment tunes, and enjoyed far more popularity than would have been expected for a black man in Reconstruction-era Texas, However, Joplin yearned to be taken seriously as a composer, which, at this time, meant writing romantic operas, so he did. Two of them. However, both flopped spectacularly and were forgotten for decades, until <em>Treemonisha</em> was rediscovered and staged in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArthurSullivan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArthurSullivan">Arthur Sullivan</a> would have preferred to be famous for his serious music, like "The Golden Legend", a cantata based on the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow poem of the same name; "The Martyr of Antioch", an oratorio about the martyrdom of St. Margaret of Antioch; and <em>Ivanhoe</em>, a grand opera based on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WalterScott" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WalterScott">Walter Scott</a> novel of the same name; rather than the comic operas he wrote with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WSGilbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WSGilbert">W. S. Gilbert</a>.
</li><li> Camille Saint-Saëns did not allow <em>The Carnival of the Animals</em> to be published in his lifetime because he feared it would overshadow his other work (which he considered superior). To this day most people know him for "The Carnival of the Animals" and "Danse Macabre", another small atmospheric lightweight piece. He considered his <em>magnum opus</em> and the culmination of all his orchestral technique to be his Symphony No.3.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTurtles">The Turtles</a> wanted to move on from their hits and create <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SgtPeppersLonelyHeartsClubBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SgtPeppersLonelyHeartsClubBand">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a></em>/<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKinksAreTheVillageGreenPreservationSociety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKinksAreTheVillageGreenPreservationSociety">The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society</a></em> type works, but the record company insisted on more hit singles in the vein of "Happy Together". Their response was "Elenore", a deliberately lightweight pastiche of their earlier works intended as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a>, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler">inevitably went on to become a hit</a>. Their later albums, including one produced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKinks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKinks">Ray Davies</a>, tend to be overlooked.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SgtPeppersLonelyHeartsClubBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SgtPeppersLonelyHeartsClubBand">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a></em> would become renowned as one of the best and most important rock albums ever, the members of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> themselves were divided on the issue; certainly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison">George Harrison</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a>, while not exactly disliking it, later admitted they couldn't see what all the fuss was about. Lennon himself preferred <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWhiteAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWhiteAlbum">The White Album</a></em> — which, while also well-acclaimed, tends to be the subject of more criticism due to its disparate sound and length. For his part, Ringo Starr mainly remembers the sessions as him not having much to do since many of the songs didn't require him to drum on them. Paul McCartney seems to view the album quite fondly (perhaps because he was the driving force behind it).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CheapTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CheapTrick">Cheap Trick</a> is probably best known for three songs; "I Want You to Want Me", "Surrender", and "The Flame". Good luck trying to get them to perform "The Flame" live, however. They've hated that song from the beginning.
</li><li> During the production of their third album <em>Silver Side Up</em>, Canadian rock band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nickelback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nickelback">Nickelback</a> (who were previously known for their alternative-rock sound) crafted another album of hard-hitting songs that they believed would finally bring them mainstream success. However, they also cranked out a song in twenty minutes on a lark to fill out the album's running time. That song, "How You Remind Me", became the group's biggest hit, and came to define their musical output since then. It's also been used by critics to show how the band was a musical punchline in the rock world (although not to the extent of their later songs).
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who</a> were in the process of recording <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tommy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tommy">Tommy</a></em>, Pete Townshend slapped together a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPop">Power Pop</a> ballad with no real relation to the story in order to get the attention of New York Times music critic Nik Cohn, who was known to be a fan of certain arcade novelties. That song was "Pinball Wizard", which easily became the most recognizable song on the album. And while <em>Tommy</em> came to be considered The Who's finest work to date, Townshend's aspirations were pegged on its ambitious followup, <em>Lifehouse</em> - which ultimately fell apart due to miscommunication and the Who parting ways with their manager, and stayed dead until Townshend revived it as a solo album and radio play nearly 30 years later, by which time his work was no longer receiving notice on the pop charts. (On the other hand, the album which resulted of the failed <em>Lifehouse</em> sessions, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WhosNext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WhosNext">Who's Next</a></em>, competes with <em>Tommy</em> as the band's most acclaimed)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouReed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouReed">Lou Reed</a>'s followup to the hit album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Transformer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Transformer">Transformer</a></em> was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Berlin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Berlin">Berlin</a></em> - a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConceptAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConceptAlbum">Concept Album</a> about drug use, depression, abuse, and suicide. He considered it his masterpiece. It flopped. He followed <em>that</em> up with the poppy, lightweight <em>Sally Can't Dance</em> which was a hit, and then acknowledged the trope and commented that maybe he shouldn't be on the next album at all. Cue <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SensoryAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SensoryAbuse">Metal Machine Music</a></em>...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DukeEllington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DukeEllington">Duke Ellington</a> believed that his Sacred Concerts, which mixed jazz and church music, were the most important thing he ever wrote. Listeners aren't so sure; critics are more likely to cite Duke's collected 1939-1942 recordings, or <em>The Far East Suite</em>, as his greatest work.
</li><li> While most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MyChemicalRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MyChemicalRomance">My Chemical Romance</a> fans consider <em>Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge</em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBlackParade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBlackParade">The Black Parade</a></em> their Magnum Opus, vocalist Gerard Way considers <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DangerDaysTheTrueLivesOfTheFabulousKilljoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DangerDaysTheTrueLivesOfTheFabulousKilljoys">Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys</a></em> as such.

Most fans agree that their best album was the first, ironically titled <em>First and Last and Always</em>...after making which lead the band to a falling out and lineup overhaul.
</li><li> In many interviews, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a> guitarist David Gilmour mentions that his favorite Floyd album was neither <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDarkSideOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDarkSideOfTheMoon">The Dark Side of the Moon</a></em>, nor <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall">The Wall</a></em>, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WishYouWereHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WishYouWereHere">Wish You Were Here</a></em>. Drummer Nick Mason has stated his favorite album was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ASaucerfulOfSecrets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ASaucerfulOfSecrets">A Saucerful of Secrets</a></em>
</li><li> Even though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa">Frank Zappa</a> never named <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThingFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThingFish">Thing-Fish</a></em> his masterpiece, he often called it an essential album because of the political message. Yet to this day many Zappa fans revile it as his worst, least imaginative and most unenjoyable record ever! Even the political aspect is so far-fetched that it loses its impact because people are unable to take it seriously.
</li><li> During his 1993 interview with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OprahWinfrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OprahWinfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> claimed he was unhappy after his famous performance of "Billie Jean" during the 1983 Motown special, solely because he was unable to keep standing on his toes after performing the moonwalk for the first time in public. Still many people consider this show to be his crowning performance achievement. Also, various comments he made about "Heal the World" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Dangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Dangerous">Dangerous</a></em> and "Earth Song" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HistoryPastPresentAndFutureBookI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HistoryPastPresentAndFutureBookI">HIStory: Past, Present And Future, Book I</a></em> suggest he intended them as his magnum opuses that would become international anthems. To the general public, they mean little compared to "Billie Jean", "Beat It", or even "Man in the Mirror".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Slayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Slayer">Slayer</a> guitarist Kerry King prefers 2001's <em>God Hates Us All</em> over <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ReignInBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ReignInBlood">Reign in Blood</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ClaudeDebussy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ClaudeDebussy">Claude Debussy</a>'s opera <em>Pelleas and Melisande</em> was by far his longest completed work and one that he took personal pride in, though it remains one of his less popular works to this day. A few years later financial circumstances forced him to publish "Suite bergamesque," a piano piece dating back to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a> period; its third movement, "Clair de lune," is one of his most famous pieces.
</li><li> Robert Plant did not believe "Stairway To Heaven" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelinIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelinIV">Led Zeppelin IV</a></em> was the definitive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> song; he believes that honor should go to "Kashmir" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhysicalGraffiti" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhysicalGraffiti">Physical Graffiti</a></em> (still likely their second best-known song). It is rumored that the fact that he would have been forced to perform it repeatedly on tour is one reason that Zeppelin's reunion was short-lived.
</li><li> Dutch poet and singer Drs. P found his poetry to be his crowning masterpiece, but it's already clear now that he will be better remembered after death for his comedic songs.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MauriceRavel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MauriceRavel">Maurice Ravel</a> didn't particularly like his piece <em>Boléro</em>, criticizing it heavily and calling it "orchestral tissue without music" that consists of one big crescendo. He was genuinely baffled by its popularity (believing his piano concertos to be better). Most people nowadays would be hard-pressed to name or recognize anything else he wrote.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DorisDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DorisDay">Doris Day</a> didn't think highly of her now most famous song, the Oscar-winning "Que Sera Sera". After she recorded the single, she proclaimed, "That's the last time you'll ever hear that song." She didn't even consider it the best of her two new songs from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWhoKnewTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWhoKnewTooMuch">The Man Who Knew Too Much</a></em>. Instead, she picked, "We'll Love Again", which viewers can barely hear over the rescue of Day's onscreen son.
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithRichards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithRichards">Keith Richards</a>' autobiography, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MickJagger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MickJagger">Mick Jagger</a> looked at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ExileOnMainSt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ExileOnMainSt">Exile on Main St.</a></em>, widely cited as the band's greatest work, as just another album. It also took a while for its critical reputation to build.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DrDre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DrDre">Dr. Dre</a>:
<ul><li> <em>The Aftermath</em> was supposed to be his masterpiece. He spent a lot of time and effort to make an album superior to <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheChronic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheChronic">The Chronic</a>.</em> He even spent a lot of money making extravagant music videos to promote the album. However, the album received mostly negative reviews from critics and a huge backlash from fans for being too mainstream and pop like. This resulted in Dr. Dre not making any personal albums for a while, producing work for artists like Eminem instead. Years later, he made <em>The Chronic 2000</em> which featured the song "Forgot About Dre", featuring Eminem." The song, itself, was a personal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> to all the fans and critics that bashed him for <em>The Aftermath.</em> Though it wasn't expected, the album was a surprising success, and considered the second best Dr. Dre album, behind the original <em>The Chronic.</em>
</li><li> For many, outside his generation of music, the only thing they know about Dr. Dre are his headphones (Beats by Dre), which have made him more money alone then all his rap career put together.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MikePatton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MikePatton">Mike Patton</a> has lamented the pop-metal hit "Epic" being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FaithNoMore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FaithNoMore">Faith No More</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong">Signature Song</a>, given the band spending years building a reputation for more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">intense</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBusting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBusting">experimental</a> work. Fortunately for them, over time their follow-up album <em>Angel Dust</em> has become increasingly become considered the band's definitive work by both fans and music publications. Interestingly and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">ironically</a> enough, this was the <em>reverse</em> case during the initial recording and release of <em>The Real Thing,</em> as "Epic" <em>was</em> considered the album's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnumOpus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnumOpus">Magnum Opus</a> at the time by the band. The record label had comparatively little confidence in the song, and it wasn't until after "From Out of Nowhere" flopped on the airwaves that "Epic" was chosen as a single. The rest is history.
</li><li> Although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmiths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmiths">The Smiths</a>' <em>The Queen Is Dead</em> is commonly considered their greatest album, all four members have gone on record proclaiming <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StrangewaysHereWeCome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StrangewaysHereWeCome">Strangeways Here We Come</a></em> as their masterwork.
</li><li> "A Moment Like This" the inaugural song by the first winner of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol">American Idol</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KellyClarkson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KellyClarkson">Kelly Clarkson</a> was a big hit and had the biggest leap to number one since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>. Kelly, however, hates the song, and since then refuses to sing it at her concerts.
</li><li> 80s one-hit-wonder band Quiet Riot ended up recording a remake of a silly, forgettable song, which they only recorded because their producer thought it would get their name out there, and then they could follow that up with their original material which they considered to be far superior. That one hit in question? "Cum On Feel the Noize".
</li><li> The operetta <em>Eileen</em> was a flop, though it was Victor Herbert's personal favorite of his works.
</li><li> While he never hated the song, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RodStewart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RodStewart">Rod Stewart</a> never fully understood the appeal of "Maggie May", which he initially released as a B-side track, but ended up getting a lot of radio play.
</li><li> Jim Kerr of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SimpleMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SimpleMinds">Simple Minds</a> has mentioned that he likes their album <em>Sons And Fascination/Sister Feelings Call</em> more than its follow up, the widely considered magnum opus <em>New Gold Dream</em>. In fairness, so do many fans. The two albums are quite similar in style - the basic difference is that New Gold Dream is a shorter, more refined album with more hits on it, whereas SAF/SFC is a double album with an epic quality.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush">Rush</a> fans tend to think that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MovingPictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MovingPictures">Moving Pictures</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TwentyOneTwelve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TwentyOneTwelve">2112</a></em> is the band's greatest. Neil Peart, the drummer and lyricist, considers <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ClockworkAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ClockworkAngels">Clockwork Angels</a></em> to be their finest. (Some fans agree, though the majority still prefer the earlier works.)
</li><li> Sammy Davis Jr. <em>hated</em> his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong">Signature Song</a> "The Candy Man". He sang the "Timmy-two-shoes, white bread" song in one sanctimonious, condescending take - you can actually hear him forcing a smile. Upon hearing the playback, he swore the song would drag him and his whole career into the sewer. Whereas Sammy's first big-budget record under the Motown label bombed (leading them to shelve the second), "The Candy Man" spent three weeks at the top of the Billboard charts in 1972.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouisArmstrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouisArmstrong">Louis Armstrong</a> felt he was a much better trumpet player later in his career than compared to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Improv" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Improv">improv</a> pieces that can be heard on his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCompleteHotFiveAndHotSevenRecordings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCompleteHotFiveAndHotSevenRecordings">The Complete Hot Five and Hot Seven Recordings</a></em> albums. All his admirers would disagree, cherishing those 1920s recordings over his arguably much better playing in the last decades of his life.
</li><li> A minor example: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS">KISS</a> vocalist/guitarist Paul Stanley often cites "Love Gun" as the best song he's ever written. While "Love Gun" is certainly well known (you're almost guaranteed to hear it at a Kiss concert), "Rock and Roll All Nite" and "Shout It Out Loud" are infinitely more famous (you'll <em>definitely</em> hear them at any Kiss concert). Ironically, the 1977 album "Love Gun" was on (called, appropriately enough, <em>Love Gun</em>) did a lot better in sales than either <em>Dressed to Kill</em> or <em>Destroyer</em>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FooFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FooFighters">Foo Fighters</a>' second album, <em>The Colour And The Shape</em>, is often thought to be the band's most widely regarded album, but the members are critical of it, feeling they've got a lot better since then, but that critics take no notice. This is illustrated in Nate Mendel's comments in the liner notes of the 10th Anniversary Edition of the album.
</li><li> Pop singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga">Lady Gaga</a> considers her 2013 album <em>ARTPOP</em> to be her best work, but a decent number of fans consider either <em>Born This Way</em> or <em>The Fame/The Fame Monster</em> her best album(s). While certainly not a hated album, and it still sold well, <em>ARTPOP</em> is seen by some more mainstream outlets as where Gaga began to decline in popularity among the mainstream pop music audience despite being quite huge just years prior.
</li><li> "Sleeping Sun", one of best known songs by the band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nightwish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nightwish">Nightwish</a>, and a highly successful single, was reluctantly composed by the band's keyboard player, Tuomas Holopainen, after the band's manager suggested he'd write a formulaic, short, catchy ballad to commemorate the European total eclipse of the summer of 1999, in order to boost the sales of the album they've just released (<em>Oceanborn</em>; in fact, that song wasn't even originally in the album, but was added for its reissue). Holopainen said he was against the idea and afterward told the manager not to ask him for one single song ever again.
</li><li> Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 14 in C♯ minor (<em>Moonlight</em>) was hugely popular in its day and is still an instantly recognizable piano piece. Ludwig himself though couldn't understand all the fuss. He reportedly said to his student, Carl Czerny, "Surely I've written better stuff than this."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomLehrer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomLehrer">Tom Lehrer</a>, who rose to fame as something of a counter-cultural icon in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> as a singer, pianist and writer of darkly humorous songs, was, before, during, and after his musical career, employed at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IvyLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IvyLeague">Harvard University</a> as a Professor of Mathematics, and never considered his career as a singer and comedian to be anything more than a hobby.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel">Billy Joel</a> gets hit with this a lot. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong">Signature Song</a> is "Piano Man", and while he likes the lyrics, he considers the music to be repetitive. He also dislikes his only number one hits, "It's Still Rock and Roll to Me" (he considers it pretentious), "Tell Her About It" (he refuses to play it in concert) and "We Didn't Start the Fire" (he thinks it's a just a novelty song and not one of his best melodies). He considers "Vienna", "She's Right on Time", "You May Be Right", "And So It Goes" and "Scenes From an Italian Restaurant" to be better songs. Arguably, the work he poured most of his heart and soul into was "The Downeaster Alexa," given that he spent years of his life in the line of work portrayed in the song.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Soundgarden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Soundgarden">Soundgarden</a>'s biggest hit, "Black Hole Sun" was written in just fifteen minutes but went on to become their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong">Signature Song</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Styx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Styx">Styx</a>: Dennis DeYoung's labor of love was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KilroyWasHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KilroyWasHere">Kilroy Was Here</a></em> - a sentiment not shared by any other band member, who decided <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorKiller">to oust</a> DeYoung shortly thereafter.
</li><li> What are the two signature songs of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Evanescence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Evanescence">Evanescence</a>? "Bring Me to Life" and "My Immortal". Singer Amy Lee has gone on record multiple times saying she doesn't particularly love the former, as it was heavily rewritten by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, or the latter, as it is not grounded in reality and is ex-guitarist Ben Moody's creature anyway. Songs that are much more personal to her don't get nearly as much commercial recognition, nor are so ingrained into pop culture  "Good Enough", for instance, is a similarly piano-driven ballad, inspired by her then-fiancé and current husband, but its release as a single was canceled by the label.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AramKhachaturian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AramKhachaturian">Aram Khachaturian</a> never actually disowned the <em>Sabre Dance</em>, but claimed that, had he known how much it will overshadow all his other works<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5lybj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5lybj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5lybj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">not <em>too</em> badly, considering just the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet">Standard Snippet</a> page contains one more work by him</span>, he would have never written it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KanyeWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KanyeWest">Kanye West</a>'s 2010 album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MyBeautifulDarkTwistedFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MyBeautifulDarkTwistedFantasy">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</a></em> is widely considered to be both his personal best and one of the best albums of the 21st century (if not of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">all time</a>) but he personally considers his 2008 album <em>808s &amp; Heartbreak</em> his best.
</li><li> Despite <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FaithGeorgeMichaelAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FaithGeorgeMichaelAlbum">Faith</a></em> being his most popular and acclaimed record, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeMichael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeMichael">George Michael</a> revealed in his final interview before he died that he considered <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Older" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Older">Older</a></em> to be his greatest work, stating, "I think I wrote the best, most healing piece of music that I've ever written in my life with that album." In regards to individual songs, he stated multiple times that he never understood why everyone loved "Careless Whisper" so much, which was because he wrote the song when he was still a teenager and he believed he had written much better songs since.
</li><li> If there's one piece by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PyotrIlyichTchaikovsky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PyotrIlyichTchaikovsky">Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky</a> that everybody knows, it's his <em>1812 Overture</em>, which has attained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet">Standard Snippet</a> status. However, he personally hated the piece. It was done <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">strictly on commission</a> and he felt no personal or artistic connection to it whatsoever. His ballet music for <em>The Nutcracker</em> is also very widely known and, while he didn't dislike that music, he didn't consider it his best work, either.
</li><li> "Thank You for Being a Friend", the 1978 hit that became especially popular once used as the theme song for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls">The Golden Girls</a></em>, was just "a little throwaway song" that took "an hour to write" according to writer Andrew Gold. Almost nothing else in his career penetrated American pop culture quite like it.
</li><li> Brazilian indie band Los Hermanos is best known to the public at large for "Anna Julia", the lead single of their debut album, in 1999. It was a bubblegum pop composition about an ex-girlfriend of their producer, and it became such a huge hit that even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison">George Harrison</a> recorded an English version penned by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Traffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Traffic">Jim Capaldi</a>. The band themselves, however, soon grew tired of being overexposed because of one song that did not reflect their style, and even though their next two albums were very praised by critics, they never got another hit like "Anna Julia" again - not that they care, considering how the song was excised from their live setlists not long after its heyday passed.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead">Radiohead</a> became big off the back of the hit single "Creep", which they either detested at the time they were recording it, or grew to detest through overexposure to the point that they refused to play it in concert for <em>decades</em>.

When they included it in the original six maps, it... went nowhere. Turns out a series of very small maps, plus control points, meant that every match was either two minutes long or two hours long, not to mention how utterly confusing the layout is for anyone who hasn't dedicated hours upon hours to learn it.

As it turned out, however, <em>Worms 4</em> got only slightly better reviews than <em>3D</em> and flopped massively sales-wise, coming within an inch of being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorKiller">Creator Killer</a> for Team17... who were dragged back from the brink by unexpectedly strong sales of <em>Open Warfare</em>.

Unfortunately, in-part thanks to an <em>extremely</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a>, the game wound up being the lowest rated title in the company's history.

They included the Hudson bee as an enemy, you can find letters that spell "Hudson", the castle was called "Hudson's Secret Castle" in Japan, and they included references to this game in several future games.

Fans, however, have a much more divisive view of both, in part because of Abby's actions in the prologue, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> killing Joel, making her playable sections of the game rather hard to swallow</span>, and because the gameplay barely changed from the first game. The dissonance is more apparent from story-telling fans, who see <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastOfUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastOfUs">The Last of Us</a></em> as Naughty Dog's more powerful product.

However, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45dU3omG0OU&amp;t=5m57s">Emile later went on to say that<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that he considers it one of his least favorite, due to him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">going through a rough patch in his life</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">faking a lot of his enthusiasm during the LP due to that</a>.

However, most of the AH crew considers their Let's Plays of various <em>Worms</em> games, and <em>3D Ultra Minigolf Adventures</em> and its sequel to be their best works.
</li><li> MatPat's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/GameTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/GameTheory">Game Theory</a></em> is by far his most popular channel and the series he enjoys working on the most.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattGroening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattGroening">Matt Groening</a> created the show hastily in the lobby of James L.

Now few people know <em>Life In Hell</em>, and <em>The Simpsons</em> is considered his Magnum Opus.
</li><li> Groening once <a class="urllink" href="http://animatedtv.about.com/od/mattgroening/tp/groeningtop10.htm">made a list<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of his favorite <em>Simpsons</em> episodes, and choose mostly examples from the first and eighth seasons, while many fans consider the third to seventh seasons to be the show's Golden Age. The first season is even generally disliked by many viewers because the show was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">still searching for its form</a> in those days. They feel that many episodes from the first season are too slow, not particularly funny and even uncharacteristic.
</li><li> Groening has mentioned "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS8E23HomersEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS8E23HomersEnemy">Homer's Enemy</a>" as being his favorite episode ever. The episode has, at least, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a> between fans who agree it is one of the best and those who think it was the start of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">Seasonal Rot</a> due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy">being too dark</a> and perceived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment">Character Derailment</a> of Homer and many secondary characters.
<ul><li> On the other side of the coin, Al Jean, the current executive producer, has said that "Homer's Enemy" is his least favourite episode.

</li><li> Writer Ian Maxtone-Graham blames himself for the show's downfall, as he admitted in a 1998 interview that he had barely seen the show when he was hired. This is actually more of a reason to love him than to hate him, as he wrote "Homer vs New York", the last episode to score more than 90% on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDb">IMDb</a>. He also wrote four episodes that made IGN's list of the ten best episodes after season 13.

<ul><li> The series has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> example with Brian Griffin. His labor-of-love novel, <em>Faster than the Speed of Love,</em> becomes a massive bomb due to its being an incredibly trite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClicheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClicheStorm">Cliché Storm</a> that unintentionally rips off the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronEagle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronEagle">Iron Eagle</a></em> series.

</li><li> Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> example: in "Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows", Brian is forced to care for a cranky shut-in after a DUI arrest, later telling her to drop dead after taking so much abuse from her. After watching a documentary on TV about how she was a famous singer who quit the business after fans wanted to hear her more well-known radio jingles rather than the operas she really wanted to perform, Brian stops her suicide attempt after telling her how much he loved her operas, which kickstarts their new-found friendship.

The resulting nonsense, <em>Wacky Deli,</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler">is a massive success</a> and only becomes <em>more</em> popular when Ralph tries to sabotage it.

Yet the latter was only published due to the insistence of Edmond Halley: Newton considered his most important work to be his studies in occultism and esoterism, which comprised about two thirds of his work. And in his own lifetime, Newton was best known for his work at the Royal Mint, which is why the design of his tomb in Westminster Abbey incorporates many references to coinage and currency, but none to science. Because of this, many historians claim that Newton wasn't the World's First Scientist; but rather the World's Last Alchemist (there being some overlap).
</li><li> Photographer Eddie Adams was best known for his Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph of a Vietnamese police chief about to execute a Viet Cong prisoner, which became an icon of the Vietnam War protest movement. <a class="urllink" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3672060.stm">Adams later regretted the photograph's notoriety<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, particularly the demonizing of the Vietnamese forces and the specific officer depicted, wishing instead to be remembered for a series of later pictures depicting Vietnamese refugees to Thailand. Needless to say, they are nowhere near as famous.
<ul><li> Part of this stemmed from the lack of context around the photo—it was perceived as a pure act of brutality, whereas in fact the man being executed was part of an assassination squad tasked with murdering South Vietnamese police and their families. When the photo was snapped, he had just been caught disposing of the bodies of wife and children of the police chief's close aide and best friend... who were also the chief's godchildren.
</li></ul></li><li> Israeli photographer David Rubinger's most famous picture is undoubtedly the scene of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rubinger#/media/File:Soldiers_Western_Wall_1967.jpg">soldiers staring in awe at the Western Wall right after its liberation from Jordan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>. However, he maintained that the photo wasn't very good because you couldn't make out everyone's faces. He preferred <a class="urllink" href="http://gpophotoheb.gov.il/fotoweb/Grid.fwx?search=D327-043.jpg#Preview1">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> image from the same event, of Rabbi Shlomo Goren blowing a shofar (ceremonial horn) in celebration. (Which is odd, because you can't see all the faces <em>there</em> either.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>'s wrote the epitaph on his own gravestone, which reads: "Author of the Declaration of American Independence [and] of the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom and Father of the University of Virginia." You might notice that "President of the United States" didn't warrant a mention. (Which makes some sense, given that he was in favor of a less centralized government.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamHowardTaft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamHowardTaft">William Howard Taft</a> was more proud of his time as Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court than as President. It's just that modern Americans aren't exactly familiar with the Chief Justices as they are with the Presidents, so it's clear which office people knew him by.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QI">QI</a></em> brought up C.B. Fry, an ancestor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenFry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenFry">Stephen Fry</a>'s and a successful turn of the century British sportsman. He represented England in football and cricket, equalled the world long-jump record in 1893, and reportedly was offered — and refused — the throne of Albania following <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>. He could also jump onto a mantlepiece backwards without losing his balance. Guess which one, much to Stephen Fry's growing irritation, was the only thing that anyone on the panel for that episode wanted to talk about? This does give pause for wonder as to what he expected, however, seeing as the panel was composed largely of comedians and aside from the mantel-jumping, C.B's other cited achievements, remarkable though they may have been, weren't exactly the stuff of potential hilarity.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristotle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristotle">Aristotle</a> is mainly remembered today for his works in philosophy and politics. However, he considered them secondary to his real work - the books on zoology. No one reads these today due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">Science Marches On</a>though actually his <em>zoology</em> was pretty good, and, contrary to what's often claimed, <em>definitely</em> involved actual observation (he knew how octopuses reproduce, for instance, something we wouldn't rediscover till the late 19th century). It was his <em>physics</em> that were bad, because they were <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hylozoism">derived from his biology<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. His reputation as a biologist tends to get tainted by association, mostly because actually studying the history of science is more work than claiming to be smarter than dead people.
</li><li> Robert Ballard has admitted in interviews that his tombstone will state that he discovered the wreck of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RMSTitanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RMSTitanic">RMS Titanic</a>, even though he's more proud of some of his other discoveries.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> put politics at the bottom of areas of knowledge he wanted to be known for, but he is best remembered as one of the United States' Founding Fathers and the man on the US $100 bill (to the point where their slang term is "Benjamins.") On the other hand, his best-known achievements are all science-related (the kite experiment<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8qesh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8qesh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8qesh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">even if he didn't actually perform it himself, it's still widely associated with him</span>, Poor Richard's Almanac, the Franklin stove, bifocals, etc.)
</li><li> The Jesuit priest James Martin tells an anecdote in his book <em>Between Heaven and Mirth;</em> a homily he spent the week lavishing over got no reaction from the congregation. The following Mass he threw his talk together at the last minute and parishioners came up to him in tears, saying it was one of the most moving sermons they'd ever heard.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardDawkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardDawkins">Richard Dawkins</a> is widely known by laymen for either his book <em>The God Delusion</em>, or <em>The Selfish Gene</em> by more scientifically-minded people, but he considers <em>The Extended Phenotype</em> his most important contribution to the Evolutionary Theory. It is also the most technical of his books.
</li><li> Mathematician G. H. Hardy loathed applied mathematics and was most proud of his works on number theory and mentoring the math genius Srinivasa Ramanujan (he was <em>slightly more</em> proud of finding Ramanujan than all of his own achievements combined). However, most people remember him for the Hardy-Weinburg Theorem, a simple piece of <em>applied</em> mathematics (heavily used in genetics and ecology) he dashed off in a few minutes.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball">Pinball</a> designer Claude Fernandez is a textbook case of this trope. His personal favorite game he designed was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/BabyPacMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/BabyPacMan">Baby Pac-Man</a></em>, a hybrid pinball-video game arcade machine that was widely loathed by pinball players and video gamers alike. However, the machine pinball fans most appreciate him for, <em>Flash Gordon</em>, was merely a result of Bally wanting to play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">Follow the Leader</a> with Williams and tasking Fernandez with building it, Fernandez largely going through the motions. During his speech at Pinball Expo 2014, Fernandez is admittedly puzzled but amused by this difference in opinion.
</li><li> Olympic and World Champion sprinter Usain Bolt is perhaps best known for his exploits over the 100m (such as his 9.69s world record <em>while slowing down</em> or his current world record of 9.58s). However, it's the 200m that has remained his favourite event from when he was a teenager.
</li><li> Despite winning six <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a>s overall, the Pittsburgh Steelers consider their 1976 team to be the best Steelers team, despite them losing Steelers QB Terry Bradshaw for the rest of the season, and were a game away from making their third consecutive Super Bowl.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopeJohnPaulII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopeJohnPaulII">Pope John Paul II</a>'s labor of love was a series of talks later published as <em>Theology of the Body</em>, seeking to rehabilitate Catholic teaching on human sexuality. After the Pope's passing in 2005, <em>Theology of the Body</em> is only revered by John Paul's most ardent supporters, as the majority of commentators note that the Pontiff's understanding of his subject matter is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero">academic at best</a>.
</li><li> Samuel Morse, the inventor of the telegraph and the Morse code, wanted to be a famous painter more than anything. He expected his epic 1822 painting, "The House of Representatives," which depicted every sitting member of Congress sitting in a meticulously-researched rendition of the chamber, to be considered one of the greatest works of American art and earn him great fame and attention, but it got scant praise and is little remembered today. Morse came up with the telegraph idea on something of a whim, mostly as a way to make money.
</li><li> Alexander Graham Bell became world famous for inventing the telephone, but he personally wanted to be remembered more on his work for teaching the deaf to speak, even if the deaf community were angered by some of his... <a class="urllink" href="https://rootedinrights.org/alexander-graham-bell-and-the-deaf-community-a-troubled-history/">controversial views on them<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
