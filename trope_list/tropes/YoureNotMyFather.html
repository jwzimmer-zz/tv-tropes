It can also be delivered to deliberately hurt a parental figure who genuinely feels that he <em>is</em> their father in every sense but the biological. In this case, the accusation typically leads to guilt on both sides, and usually a last-minute apology and reconciliation...unless it turns out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PartingWordsRegret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PartingWordsRegret">the last time they ever speak</a>.

<ul><li> Used by Vivio on her adoptive mother Nanoha after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Quattro manipulates her into fighting her adopted mother</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS</a></em>. This happened while Nanoha was being fueled by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">Mama Bear</a> rage. Ouch. In an unusual variation, Vivio meant this <em>literally</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She'd been mind-screwed so thoroughly by Quattro that the poor girl <em>genuinely</em> believed that the person she was facing was someone <em>disguised</em> as her Mama in an attempt to deceive her. Even after she realizes that it's the actual Nanoha, she keeps this view since, as a clone made for the express purpose of moving a giant battleship, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues">she doesn't view herself worthy of having parents</a>.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ace uses this phrase on Garp in a flashback, in response to him opposing his plan to become a pirate. Unlike some who invoke it on a non-biological father figure, he doesn't think much of his biological father, Gol D. Roger.
</li><li> In the Dressrosa arc, a minor flashback (a few days ago, rather than the usual year gap) shows a disagreement between sixteen-year old Rebecca and her parental figure, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingToy">Living Toy</a> Thunder Soldier. The former wants to participate in a tournament so she could <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> win the Flame-Flame Fruit and kill Doflamingo</span>, the latter heavily protests against it, not wanting the young girl to die. His dissuasion, combined with her frustration following <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Doflamingo's fake resignation from the Seven Warlords of the Sea</span>, leads to her saying that he's not her father, but just a one-legged toy soldier. Stricken and unwilling to argue any longer, the Soldier prays that she doesn't enter and leaves, as Rebecca, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">regretting what she did</a>, tries in vain to get him to stay. Fortunately, they reconcile off-screen. It's even more hurtful for the Thunder Soldier because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he <em>is</em> Rebecca's father. He is in fact the legendary warrior Kyros who was transformed into a toy. Nobody else, not even Rebecca, remembers him because people who are transformed into toys become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson">unpersoned</a>. Then, at the end of the arc she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inverts</a> it, tearfully begging him to stop pretending that he's not her father after he spread a rumor that she's the daughter of some foreign prince to spare her the shame of having a murderer for a father.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sanji understandably refuses to think of Vinsmoke Judge, the man who abused him as a child, as his father in any way. When Sanji meets Judge for the first time in years, the former reaffirms this during their battle. He also denies any relation to the Vinsmoke family as a whole since he makes it clear that Vinsmoke Sanji, the weak little boy they ridiculed, "died at sea" after escaping from Germa 13 years earlier. Even after rescuing Judge, Sanji still considers Zeff his <em>true</em> father.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Persona4TheAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Persona4TheAnimation">Persona 4: The Animation</a></em>, after Nanako finally has enough of her father putting his work before her, she subjects him to a tear-filled rant before finishing with this line and sprinting off upstairs. Earlier in the episode, she builds up to this by telling Yu that she doubts her father is actually her father because he seems to care about his work more than her.
</li><li> Kyo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em> shouted this (in a flashback) about his adoptive father, who became distant after overhearing it. It turns out it was because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kyo (who has self-esteem issues) didn't want people to reflect poorly on his adoptive father by thinking they were related, as he's not worthy of having such a good parent</span>.
</li><li> This is put to very emotionally moving use in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu">Princess Tutu</a></em>, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rue finally defies the Raven</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">The American Revolution</a> is pretty much portrayed this way: America tells England, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a> mixture of a father and a brother, that "I'm not your little brother anymore" during their final fight.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpacePirateMito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpacePirateMito">Space Pirate Mito</a></em> is devastated when Aoi ends a fight by shouting "You're not my mom, you're just an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobileSuitHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobileSuitHuman">alien in a suit</a> that looks like my mom!" because she actually <em>is</em> his mother even if she is an alien in a suit. They reconcile when she tells him the story of how she met his father.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: Uryuu is so angry with his father Ryuuken's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefusalOfTheCall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefusalOfTheCall">rejection</a> of the family Quincy lineage that he verbally refuses to call him "Father", using Ryuuken's first name instead. Flashbacks reveal a past argument over it that culminated in Uryuu demanding to know why and being horrified when Ryuuken claims there's no money in the lifestyle. It's implied to be the moment when Uryuu lost all respect for his father, as it seems to be the last time Uryuu ever called him "Father" out loud. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicNeutral">Ryuuken</a> was actually lying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast">hide the truth</a> but Uryuu hasn't yet realised.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>, Erza Scarlet finds out her birth mother is a despicable woman who gave birth to her just so she could take over her body and escape her own horribly cursed body, dumped her in a random village when she failed, and is now actively trying to kill her out of spite. Because of this, Erza understandably has no trouble telling her that her guild is her true family, not that said mother actually cares since they're enemies regardless. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When her mother can't bring herself to kill Erza and takes her own life, however, Erza pays her respects by calling her "Mother" for the first and only time</span>.
</li><li> Wrath from the 2003 version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> was created when Izumi tried to resurrect her stillborn son through alchemy. They met several years afterwards when Izumi and the Elrics discovered him living as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildChild">Wild Child</a> on an island. Izumi treated Wrath like a son even before learning of his past and Wrath liked her back, but once Envy got his hands on Wrath, he returned his memories and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">Wrath went off the deep end</a>. He rejected Izumi as his mother due to believing she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">abandoned him</a> and ultimately began viewing Sloth as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a> instead. Wrath didn't begin to acknowledge Izumi as his mom until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shortly before her death</span>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemistTheConquerorOfShamballa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemistTheConquerorOfShamballa">Fullmetal Alchemist: The Conqueror of Shamballa</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they end up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TogetherInDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TogetherInDeath">Together in Death</a></span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDXD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDXD">High School D×D</a></em>:
<ul><li> Akeno Himejima is repulsed that her biological father, Baraqiel, wasn't able to save Shuri Himejima from being murdered by her own relatives. As such, she crosses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a> and refuses to think of him as her father for a while. By Volume 7, however, she reconciles with him thanks to Issei Hyoudou's help to the point that they defeat Loki.
</li><li> Vali Lucifer considers Azazel as his true father, as his grandfather Rizevim <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">had Vali's biological father abuse him years before</span>. Even when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vali's biological father died</span>, that's as far as reconciliation goes.

</li><li> The end of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen">X-Men</a>: TAS</em> episode "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAWbrzxNQ5M">Beauty and the Beast<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>", involving Graydon Creed, is a rare example of an adult invoking this. Wolverine attempts to break up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">anti-mutant grassroots terrorist group</a> "The Friends of Humanity" by broadcasting a hologrammatic profile of the infamous mutant terrorist Sabertooth, which informs the thugs that the mutant's real name is "Graydon Creed <em>Senior</em>". Horrified to learn they've been following the son of a mutant, they promptly abandon him whilst Graydon has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a>, grabbing a nearby pistol and firing repeatedly at the Sabertooth hologram whilst screaming that Sabertooth isn't his father.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether">Drawn Together</a></em>, Clara invokes this in an argument with her stepmother. Her stepmother then reminds her that her mother's dead, and after realizing that she went too far in bringing this up, the two reconcile and Clara's stepmother gives her advice on how to break her Octopussoir curse.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em>:
<ul><li> The skit "Jedi Master George W./Jedi In Chief" more or less parodies this trope during a parody of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmYourFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmYourFather">I Am Your Father</a> scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>, with George Bush as Vader and his daugther Jenna replacing Luke:

</div></li><li> Another skit involved an aging Stretch Armstrong no longer able to stretch. He has surgery to restore his stretchiness, but is told to wait until his stitches heal. He doesn't listen, and he dies. His wife remarries <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PlasticMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PlasticMan">Plastic Man</a>, prompting her son to exclaim that he's not his real dad.

The laid-back Baloo and his somewhat professional-yet-motherly boss Rebecca often act as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">surrogate parents</a> to Kit, who alternates between a child's need for adult guidance and his own fiercely independent streak, which <em>usually</em> works quite well unless Kit feels he is being disregarded because of his age. In the episode "Stormy Weather," the villain of the week quite ably leverages this insecurity against Baloo and Rebecca's protectiveness of Kit in order to convince the child the adults are "holding him back" from his true potential, leading Kit to eventually break things off with them on the grounds that "you can't tell me what to do! You're not my dad!"

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsCloneWars">Star Wars: Clone Wars</a></em>, while arguing with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMentor">Obi-Wan</a>, Anakin snaps at him that "You're no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Qui-Gon Jinn!"</a>, referring to both Obi-Wan trying to live up to his late master's legacy as well as Qui-Gon being the closest thing Anakin had to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">father</a>. Anakin immediately apologizes and Obi-Wan forgives him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan">Sym-Bionic Titan</a></em>, Lance says this line to the King of Galaluna, who isn't a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a>, but was a friend of Lance's father. Immediately after saying that, Lance accepted that his father's dead, after the whole episode with optimism that he might still be alive since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">there was no body</a>.
</li><li> After defeating him, Elyon says a variation of this to her evil older brother Phobos in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH">W.I.T.C.H.</a>, having learned that he was planning to drain her of her powers all along.

</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>, Jesus says this to Joseph during a fight. He calls his real father, God, on the phone, asking Him to let Jesus move in with Him. God turns him down, because (unbeknownst to Jesus) He has a lady friend over at the time.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperBestFriendsForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperBestFriendsForever">Super Best Friends Forever</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a></em> tells <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> this when the latter goes to enforce the former's grounding.

It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny">or at least attempted anyway.</a>

Hatred, "You're not my real bodyguard!" It drives home the fourth season's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentWithNewParamour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentWithNewParamour">Parent with New Paramour</a> theme resulting from Hatred replacing former bodyguard and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a> Brock.
</li><li> Heavily implied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender">Voltron: Legendary Defender</a></em>, where Lotor would only refer to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Haggar</span> (eventually revealed to be Lotor's Altean mother, Honevra) as "Witch." Made explicit in Season 6, when Lotor tells <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Haggar</span> that he considers Honevra dead and she was an abomination taking her place.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em>: In "A Great Secret Revealed", Bloom cries out to Vanessa, "You're not my mother!" when she realizes she was adopted.

After an awkward "family" dinner, she finally snaps, accusing Ms. Kristal of trying to steal her father and replace her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">Missing Mom</a>, and telling her "You're not my mother and you never will be!" She regrets this afterwards and apologizes, though, and her father assures her that no one will ever take her place or her mother's in his heart.
