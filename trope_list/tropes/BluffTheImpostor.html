<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DescendantsOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DescendantsOfDarkness">Descendants of Darkness</a></em>, Hisoka suspects that Tsuzuki is possessed by a demon and tells him, as usual, to bring something to eat for their boss Chief Konoe. He "reminds" Tsuzuki that Konoe hates sweets, and when Tsuzuki falls for it, he knows it's an impostor. (Konoe has a notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetTooth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetTooth">Sweet Tooth</a>.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FromEroicaWithLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FromEroicaWithLove">From Eroica with Love</a></em>, Major Eberbach tests if a guide who called him is a KGB spy by asking her about a fictitious aunt. When the guide gets confused, he concludes she's no spy, because a spy would've pretended to know the woman.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>
<ul><li> Sasuke came up with a very long and convoluted "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrustPassword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrustPassword">password</a>" for his two teammates to memorize in case they ever needed confirmation of one another's identity. Naruto leaves to go to the bathroom, and when he comes back, Sasuke asks him to code in. Naruto repeats it back perfectly... and Sasuke decks the imposter, declaring that the <em>real</em> Naruto would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">never have been able to remember something that long</a>.
</li><li> Later, the Mizukage does this quite expertly, although her victim is not an impostor, but under control. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ao, possessed by one of Danzo's men, encounters the Mizukage and Chojuro, apologizing to the latter for getting into a position in which he needed help, then asks the Mizukage to remove the seal on his eye. She then points out that Ao would not apologize to Chojuro, and he'd know the sealing tag could not be removed, then punches him when he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">calls her</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">an old hag</a>, thus restoring Ao to normal</span>.
</li><li> Naturally, Naruto is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">too stupid</a> to pull one of these himself. In one filler arc, he, Hinata and Kiba have to deal with impostors copying their every facet. So naturally when trying to identify the real Hinata, rather than asking a baited question like, "Hey, Hinata, how did you defeat Neji during the Chuunin exams?" he inverts the trope, asking, "What is the name of Hinata's father?" — a question any good imposter would study beforehand, but one that Naruto himself didn't know the answer to, making it utterly useless even if the imposter didn't know!
</li><li> Sakura pulls one of these off <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">against Zetsu, who was impersonating Neji during the current world war. Or rather, Zetsu does it to <em>himself</em>. When Sakura mentions that Tonton (Tsunade's pig) is being looked at for a twisted leg, Zetsu!Neji says that it's better to have injured her leg than her hand, then asks if Tonton can still weave signs. Sakura says yes, but then when Zetsu!Neji comes closer, she pounds him into the ground and tells him that Tonton's a pig.</span>
<ul><li> This is actually quite a clever application by the writers considering that the Zetsus seem to learn a fair amount about the people they impersonate. Neji's team mate is Tenten. It's not such a stretch to think that Zetsu was simply trying to be too clever.
</li></ul></li><li> Episode 333: The imposter shows up in front of the real Naruto Uzumaki and declares that he is Naruto Uzumaki. Until Naruto said that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfrontingYourImposter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfrontingYourImposter">he was the real one</a> and the imposter got curbstomped.
</li></ul></li><li> Used in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> manga: Riza Hawkeye and Roy Mustang are hunting down the shapeshifting Envy and get separated; when they meet up again, they exchange a few words, then start off looking for Envy... until Hawkeye puts her gun to Mustang's head. This leads to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassOhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassOhCrap">universal "oh crap" from the fanbase</a>, until...
<div class="indent"><strong>Mustang:</strong> What are you doing, Lieutenant? Don't you know who your gun's pointed at? <br/><strong>Riza:</strong> <em>Who?</em> Don't make me laugh. When we're alone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">the Colonel always calls me by my first name, Riza.</a> <br/><strong>Envy:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Grk!</a> <em>(dives away, transforming back into Envy)</em> So you two are that close, are you? <br/><strong>Riza:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILied">I Lied</a>. *BANG* But thanks for falling for it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">Now you can do me the favor of dying.</a>
</div></li><li> Done heartbreakingly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Karin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Karin">Karin</a></em> (with a bottle of Tabasco sauce) towards the end of the manga, to determine if the title character's sister has matured to the point where scheduling differences now leave her without any daywalking family. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">Adult vampires</a>, you see, have no sense of taste.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Guyver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Guyver">Guyver</a></em>, protagonist Sho is handcuffed to love interest Mizuki so he can't bio-boost without blasting the broad to bloody bits. Hearing half a warning that she might not be who she appears to be, Sho laments that this had to happen right after Mizuki's birthday. She agrees, and her cover is blown because Sho knows her birthday is later in the year.
</li><li> Love of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FreshPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FreshPrettyCure">Fresh Pretty Cure!</a></em> bluffs an impostor of her mother by switching her and Setsuna's presents and thanking her for the wrong one.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWars">Digimon Xros Wars</a></em>, episode 39, Kiriha suddenly remembers to return a Digimemory he borrowed from Taiki, and Taiki agrees. Except that the borrowing never happened, and Kiriha hands over a small explosive device that ruins Splashmon's impersonation of Taiki.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina">Love Hina</a></em>, Keitaro lies about being a student at Tokyo U, so Naru asks him about the miso-boiled lobster they serve in the cafeteria. Keitaro babbles on for a bit about how it's his favourite food that he can't start the day without, before Naru tells him that there is no such thing as a miso-boiled lobster.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a>: Stardust Crusaders</em>:
<ul><li> During an attempt to find an enemy Stand user, Jotaro claims that Stand users have blood vessels on their nose that stand out when they inhale cigarette smoke. All of his allies reach for their noses... as does the captain of the ship they're on. Then Jotaro adds that he was bluffing, and his suspect drops the innocent act.
</li><li> This happens again later in <em>Stardust Crusaders</em> to a man who used his Stand to replicate Jotaro himself, albeit unintentionally. His plan to kill Jotaro goes horribly awry when Jotaro's friends all force him into their car and, because they're bored, repeatedly request "Jotaro" to perform various stunts of increasing danger (such as holding multiple lit cigarettes inside his mouth), each time saying that Jotaro is good at this sort of thing. The impostor pulls them all off and so Jotaro's friends never once suspect he's a fake, but the impostor gets so nervous that he decides it's not worth the risk of self-mutilation and, claiming he needs to take a dump, escapes from the car as fast as he can run.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn">K-On!</a></em>: Ui has disguised herself, rather convincingly as Yui until she slips polite speech which starts to undo her cover. She tries to deny it but Azusa demands Ui call her by her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSeriesNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSeriesNickname">nickname</a>.
</li><li> A rare case of this happening to the protagonist occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Arisa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Arisa">Arisa</a></em>. Tsubasa is disguised as her titular (comatose) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinSwitch">twin sister</a> in an attempt to figure out the true identity of "the King", a figure causing all sorts of bullying, manipulation and general chaos at Arisa's school. At one point, she receives a message from someone she strongly suspects to be the King, telling her to meet them at the place Arisa's boyfriend took her on her birthday. Tsubasa can't find that detail in Arisa's letters, so she feigns memory loss from a stay in the hospital to get the boyfriend to tell her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She was doomed from the start, though, since Arisa's boyfriend <em>is</em> the King and has known about the switch the entire time.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Obsolete" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Obsolete">Obsolete</a></em>, during a demonstration of their uparmored Exoframes to Rei Miyajima, Captain Wangchuk of the Indian Army Special Warfare Brigade Ladakh Scouts demonstrates a "traditional Indian exercise" while operating an Exoframe. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> At the end of the episode, Wangchuk reveals to a subordinate that the exercise was actually a common Japanese calisthenic routine, and the fact that the Miyajima didn't immediately react or recognize it confirmed Wangchuk's suspicions that Miyajima was not from Japan, much less seconded by the Japanese Ground Self-Defense Force as he claimed to be.</span>

<ul><li> In the <em>Team 7/Weapon X</em> crossover, the two squads meet in an underground base they were both tasked with blowing up. At gunpoint, they ask each other sports questions to find out if they are Soviets. Amusingly, Wolverine (a Canadian) asks a hockey question, which would probably be more easily answered by a Russian than an American.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a>: The Oath</em>, Doctor Strange encounters a demonic entity who tries to convince Strange that he is facing one of his most powerful foes, Dormammu. Strange, suspicious of Dormammu's sudden arrival, asks him, "So where is Umar, your rapscallion of a brother?" When Dormammu answers, "He is none of your concern," Strange has his answer; Umar is Dormammu's <em>sister</em>.

Pretending to be happy, she reminds the false Rrrr that she had to come to Brastak (his planet) from Earth via another planet (while in reality she flew straight there from the planet Penelope), tells him that on Earth it's raining mushrooms, and asks him if he remembers how they met on Pataliputra and played in the snow (that planet has tropical climate even in the polar regions). When he doesn't react to any of it, she is left with no doubt that it's an impostor. Subverted, since she gets carried away so much with thinking up absurdities, the impostor also realizes she doesn't believe him.

The Emperor insists that he play with his toy trains, which the actor dutifully does. The Emperor then asks him who he <em>really</em> is, because all the past times he had met with the politician and asked him to play with the trains the politician had refused and teased him about having such a childish hobby — it was a sort of game between them.

</li><li> Dr Calvin puts the robots in a situation where trying to rescue a human would (as far as they know) destroy them (prohibited by the Third Law unless trumped by the First or Second). Indeed, the lost robot does not try to rescue the human  but has cleverly convinced the other robots not to try either (that they'd be destroyed before succeeding becomes an argument to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderByInaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderByInaction">ignore the First Law</a>).

</li><li> In a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NancyDrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NancyDrew">Nancy Drew</a></em> book, Nancy has become suspicious of a young man claiming to be the long-lost son of the wealthiest man in town. (The man was presumed dead in an avalanche during a trip to Switzerland but has returned several years later, claiming to have been recuperating in a hospital all this time). While initially charming everyone, he still makes several mistakes — buying his housekeeper a chocolate cake for her birthday when he should know that she's allergic, as she once had a severe reaction in front of him. Nancy finally trips him up by gushing about his 18th birthday party (the last one he had before vanishing), mentioning how cool his "giant purple and white football cake" was. The man enthusiastically agrees — until Nancy coldly informs that that's NOT the kind of cake that was served.
<ul><li> Nancy also does this to Beth's boyfriend Alan in one of the <em>Case Files</em> stories when Beth goes missing, and she suspects Alan knows more than he's letting on. She asks if Beth took a specific type of medication. When Alan says yes, Nancy realises he's bullshitting because Beth is allergic to said medication, and taking it could kill her. Alan is forced to come clean.

The 'American' assures him that Dr Starr's memory is still honored in Kansas. After he's left, Holmes assures Watson that he's not what he claims - there was no ad in the agony columns and "Dr Lysander Starr" is completely fictional.

He shows his diploma to the captain, who immediately asks how his good friend the chancellor of the academy is doing, seemingly forgetting his name. Ralph helpfully supplies the name and, when the captain asks how the chancellor's wooden leg is feeling, calmly corrects him that, when Ralph last saw the chancellor, he had two good legs but only one eye.

She tested him by asking if he'd consulted his sister about a certain business dealing. Not having had the chance for a proper briefing about the man he posed as, he said dismissively, "What does she have to do with it?" Of course, "My husband doesn't have a sister."

When May agrees, Coulson knows enough; the real May hates coffee.
</li><li> In "Love in the Time of HYDRA" this happens again, this time Agent 33 vs Talbot. To be fair, Talbot realizes very quickly and notifies Coulson "The nanomask is in play", and assembles all female staff workers, even telling his security not to let anyone disturb him, even if it is him. He even knows a lot about his staff, knowing which lines to say and how they should respond.

</li><li> A completely different episode has him as the bluffer instead of the imposter, noting in his voice-over that if someone is asking for information, it's basic security to do this to ensure they're who they say they are and it's a pretty good tactic:

Of course, Jessica knows he's lying as her husband's name was NOT Tom, and he served in a different division of the armed forces than the one she named. However, she doesn't confront him with this, nor reveal it to anyone else, knowing the man could easily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> it as an honest mistake rather than an outright lie.

This tripped up the chef because the dish in question was actually salmon. The chef was then forced to confess that he did not graduate from cooking school, which tied in with a possible motive for murder at the restaurant where he worked.

In a subversion of this trope, Samson doesn't seem to cotton on to her plot even when the Philistines try to kill him by exploiting the exact same false weakness he just told Delilah.

Partially subverted anyway. It takes a bit for Light to realize that the fake note makes sense, and L ends up being slightly more suspicious of Light than he was before the test.

</div></li><li> Briefly subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em> episode <em>Masquerade</em>, where five Autobots disguise themselves to resemble the Decepticon car-based team, the Stunticons, and thwart Megatron's plan. The real Stunticons escape and confront their duplicates, but Megatron is smart enough to call for the Stunticons to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombiningMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombiningMecha">combine</a> into Menasor, figuring that the Autobot fakes won't be able to do the same. The real Stunticons immediately comply, while the Autobots...merge to form their own Menasor, much to everyone's confusion. The writers were being clever here, as the team of Autobots disguised as the Stunticons includes Mirage, an expert with holograms, and Windcharger, whose special power is his ability to control magnetism. Windcharger therefore 'links' the Autobots together in the rough shape of Menasor, at which point Mirage disguises them as a copy of the real thing. It works, up until Soundwave reminds Megatron that the real Menasor will be able to access the Stunticon's own special powers and weapons.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GIJoeRenegades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GIJoeRenegades">G.I. Joe: Renegades</a></em>, Zartan impersonates Duke shortly after gaining his trademark ability. Roadblock, recalling a long story he told in the beginning, asks them for a detail about it. Unfortunately, Roadblock's story was so mind-numbingly boring that no one was paying attention, and both Dukes look at him and say they have <em>no idea</em> what the answer is, at the same time. Shortly thereafter, Snake Eyes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">who can tell the difference because Duke and Zartan have different heartbeats,</a> appears from nowhere and kicks the impostor in the face.
