<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaitouSaintTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaitouSaintTail">Kaitou Saint Tail</a></em> grew feelings for the detective pursuing her, but he was so obsessed with catching Saint Tail that Haneoka Meimi barely registered. In one episode, she gets so frustrated with him that she yells her secret identity in front of the whole class, and his response is "...what was that about Saint Tail?" This gets Meimi so frustrated that she jumps between wanting to give up the secret identity and just wanting to have nothing to do with him. Later, her identity finally begins to register with him, after a magic mirror that shows your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueSelf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueSelf">True Self</a> displays Meimi instead of Saint Tail. At least until he concludes they just look alike, as Saint Tail and Meimi Haneoka act <em>completely</em> different, with Meimi being shy but short tempered and Saint Tail the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">largest ham in the series</a>.
</li><li> Light/Kira from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>, to the extent that by the end of the series, Kira has abandoned nearly all of the ideals which Light used to stand for.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mamoru Chiba in the manga version can sometimes slip into this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">The accident that killed his parents</a> left him with no memory of them or his life before that point. It's also implied that unlike the Sailor Senshi his powers are "on" all the time, and he doesn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenshinHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenshinHero">transform</a>, he simply changes clothes.
</li><li> Also from the manga version, Usagi is shown being confused about which of her three identities (Usagi Tsukino, Sailor Moon, Princess Serenity) is the "real" her.
</li><li> In the manga version Minako's personality slowly changes during the run of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodenameSailorV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodenameSailorV">Codename: Sailor V</a></em>, becoming more serious and rather ruthless while sometimes changing back to the original. In the main series it's clear that Minako isn't the clumsy but well-meaning student she once was nor the legendary hero Sailor Venus is seen as but something in the middle... But it's still unclear <em>what</em>, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">she's extremely skilled at hiding her emotional pain</a> behind a mask of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Alto Saotome from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier">Macross Frontier</a></em> had a variation of this; he gave up a promising career as an actor (while heir to a renowned family of such) seemingly inexplicably, with it being strongly implied in the show and directly stated in the movie as being due to a sense that his stage roles (as well as his expected role as heir to the family tradition) left him unsure as to what his own identity was.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu">Princess Tutu</a></em> is essentially a role assumed by Duck, predating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a> and granted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Drosselmeyer</a>. While the two are clearly the same person, their behavior is markedly different, and not just because Duck is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteClumsyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteClumsyGirl">worst</a> dancer in the series while Tutu is probably the best.
<ul><li> And add in another layer that Duck is also uncertain if she's really a Bird, a Girl, or a Princess. That's three competiting identities.
</li></ul></li><li> Hei in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack">Darker Than Black</a></em> has two identities, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Adorkable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Adorkable">Adorkable</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> Li Shenshung, a Chinese exchange student, and the Black <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami">Reaper</a>, a remorseless mass-murdering assassin and spy. When he's talking to people as Li, it's easy to tell when someone hits a nerve because his eyes will go so ice-cold that he looks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControlEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControlEyes">mind-controlled</a>. And when he's the Black Reaper, he wears a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMaskOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMaskOfDoom">white</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaskPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaskPower">mask</a>. At the beginning of the series, it seems like the Black Reaper is his true character, but it gradually becomes clear that while neither persona is the real Hei, he's actually closer to Li, but ended up stuck playing a different role due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> plays with this trope when it comes to resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> Lelouch: Lelouch Lamperouge is, of course, the civilian identity he adopted to hide from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>. Lelouch vi Britannia is his birth identity, which is legally dead. And finally, we have Zero, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">over-the-top</a> dark avenger/terrorist/freedom fighter/resistance leader persona. However, the question as to which one is real is largely subverted. Lamperouge is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichIdiotWithNoDayJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichIdiotWithNoDayJob">completely made up</a>; however, it is the identity he uses with his friends and sister, seeming to be the most "real" near the end. Vi Britannia is the identity he truly hated, due to his hatred of Britannia, but it was also the one his royal sibling recognized him as. Zero, meanwhile, seems to represent his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Large Ham</a> tendencies, as well as his inner hatred and desire for justice. At times, he seems to consider Zero his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueSelf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueSelf">True Self</a>. Near the finale he seems to come to terms with this and states "I finally know who I really am!" when he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kills his parents</span>. He later uses the vi Britannia identity to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">take over the world and initiate the Zero Requiem</span>, becoming known to the masses by that name. As <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Emperor Lelouch</span>, he displays traits common to all his personas: Zero's hamminess, vi Britannia's royal bearing, and Lamperouge's (<em>very well</em> hidden) kindness. The debate as to who he really is ended up being so divisive to fans that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">claims to his survival or death are often attributed to which "identity" has died</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>: Vinegar Doppio has a rather unclear case of this. Despite his alter ego as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Diavolo</span> he isn't aware of it himself but it acts as an actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality">split personality</a>. It's never revealed which was the original persona though it's implied that Doppio was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Diavolo's</span> persona he used to seem inconspicuous before the two personalities split apart.
</li><li> At one point of the manga version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CatsEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CatsEye">Cat's Eye</a></em>, the girls decide to try and draw <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticInspectorAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticInspectorAntagonist">Toshio</a> into their thieving gang, with Hitomi (who is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingCatwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingCatwoman">Toshio's girlfriend</a>) materially attempting the job with her hair dyed blonde and green contact lenses. At first she's just doing the attempts and flirting with him... But at one point Hitomi realizes that she's jealous of the blonde Cat's Eye, <em>and the blonde Cat's Eye is jealous of Hitomi!</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Hitomi openly wonders what's wrong with herself</a>...
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Reiner Braun</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> suffers an extreme version of this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The stress and guilt of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> causes him to begin slipping so far into his "Soldier" persona that he forgets it isn't real. The two identities don't appear to be that different, other than the obvious conflict of duty — the real mission to infiltrate and attack humanity, in opposition to the false mission to defend humanity as a soldier on the front lines</span>.

<ul><li> Throughout the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> mythos, there is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">common but far-from-universal</a> idea that is Batman is the real identity, while Bruce Wayne is a construct.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a></em> he realizes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gaslighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gaslighting">that the voice in his head telling him to kill himself</a> was a fake <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpottingTheThread" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpottingTheThread">when it referred to him as Bruce</a>. "That's not what I call myself in my head." Then Terry asks him, "What <em>do</em> you call yourself?" He gets a look.
<div class="indent"><strong>Terry:</strong> I suppose you would. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">But that's</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">my</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">name now</a>. <br/><strong>Bruce:</strong> Tell that to my subconscious.
</div></li></ul><dl><dt></dt><dd>Although this might be less "Batman is the real identity" and more "Batman is so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a> he trained himself to call himself Batman in his head to prevent mind-reading villains from learning his identity".
</dd></dl><ul><li> One Batman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> novel implies that Bruce Wayne has, in fact, "subdivided" his mind between the two separate identities, and that the "Bruce" aspect is physically weaker than "Batman", despite Wayne's training.
</li><li> The extent to which this is true varies over time, tending to oscillate from one extreme to the other in a manner reminiscent of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyclicTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyclicTrope">Cyclic Trope</a>. As of October 2007, most current portrayals are tending away from this trope; no doubt it will change back in a few years. And given the speech about Bruce being the mask at the end of <em>Batman Begins</em>, and the way movies tend to set the next few years of the comics they're based on, that may already be starting.
</li><li> In the "Batman RIP" storyline <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a villain-induced psychological trauma "kills" Bruce Wayne</span>, and as a result, Batman <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> takes on an emergency backup persona as a garishly-costumed version of "Batman without Bruce", The Batman of Zur-En-Arrh<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0obzr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0obzr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0obzr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Unlike the Silver Age version, Zur-En-Arrh's name is based on Bruce incorrectly remembering his father's last words: "The sad thing is they'd probably throw someone like Zorro in Arkham."</span>, and goes around Gotham beating criminals with a Bat-bat along with a (maybe) hallucinatory Bat-Mite.</span>
</li><li> The idea was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstructed</a> during the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BruceWayneFugitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BruceWayneFugitive">Bruce Wayne: Murderer/Fugitive</a>" storyline. In an issue leading up to the arc, Bruce was toying with the idea that while Batman can't kill, his alter ego Matches Malone can (he backed down from that). After being framed for murder, going to prison and then escaping, Batman decided to abandon the Bruce Wayne identity entirely, losing most of his compassion in the process. The rest of the Batfamily are shocked when he tells them point blank that there is no Bruce Wayne, and refuses to answer Nightwing when he asks who adopted Dick Grayson if that's true. One of the main writers for the storyline summed it up pretty well. "Somewhere in the Bat Bible, it's written 'Bruce Wayne is the mask, not Batman. Oh, and he's not crazy'. That always bugged me. If that's not crazy, then what is?".
</li><li> In <em>Arkham Asylum</em>, when he's captured by the Joker and the inmates want to take off his mask, the Joker tells them not to be stupid; that mask <em>is</em> his face.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a> tried to establish in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GrantMorrisonsBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GrantMorrisonsBatman">Batman works</a> that there is no "Bruce is Batman's mask" or "Batman is Bruce's mask" since it was that kind of thinking that nearly destroyed him just around the time that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis">Infinite Crisis</a> was going on. So Bruce Wayne attempted to rid himself of his demons and start anew during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FiftyTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FiftyTwo">missing year</a>. Nowadays, he is both Bruce Wayne <em>and</em> Batman, neither less than the other, both more human than either one could be alone. One blogger (Chris Sims) cleverly pointed out that not only does Batman fight crime, but Bruce does as well through humanitarian efforts such as funding rehab centers and hiring former criminals at Wayne Tech to help them get a fresh start. Furthermore, he <em>remembers</em> each of them.
<ul><li> Bruce's humanitarian work really took off during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanNoMansLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanNoMansLand">No Man's Land</a>, where he actually took time off as Batman to fight congress, among other things, as Bruce Wayne. Also, this is where Dick Grayson decides to become a cop (thus fighting crime as both Dick and Nightwing) and Batman tells him "You're better than me, Dick.", saying he has made both Robin and Nightwing "an extension of who [he is]", rather than just becoming the mask.
</li><li> This is also the path that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy">The Dark Knight Trilogy</a> took from the start. The playboy idiot Bruce Wayne "persona", such as it is, was a kind of on the spot bullshit maneuver Bruce used to deflect suspicion. Judging from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth">immediately previous living conditions</a>, Bruce never has been that sort of man. In turn, Alfred's role in the films is to constantly remind Batman that <em>he IS Bruce Wayne too</em> and that he shouldn't cast that away as eagerly as he seems to be doing.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamSeries">Arkham</a></em> games <em>seem</em> to follow this as well; at the beginning of <em>Arkham City</em>, Bruce Wayne is campaigning to have the prison closed, because he can't really do any open political activism as Batman. But the games very rarely depict Bruce Wayne outside of the batsuit, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">about half the times it does are actually Hush impersonating Bruce Wayne.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Many would say that the truest Bruce is the detective in the cave, in costume but not the cowl, often with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> at his side. In public, whether as Bruce Wayne or as Batman, he has to put on an act. It's only when he doesn't need to hide either of his identities that he can truly be himself.

It was also about his habit of dating her in various disguises. She was getting a bad reputation for "cheating" on Nightwing. Of course given how bad the Titans of that era were at keeping Dick's identity secret, one wonders why they bothered. Too bad the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeddingSmashers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeddingSmashers">wedding was crashed</a> by an ex-teammate turned evil...
</li><li> Tim Drake originally had no trouble with acting as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries">Robin</a> and considering it nothing more than a job he would eventually leave, but he would sometimes address himself in the third-person in his thought dialogues, either as 'Robin' or 'Tim Drake' indicating which of his ids he was feeling more like at the time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> is mostly Peter Parker. The witty quips he makes when fighting supervillains are usually belied by his internal monologue about his life as Peter Parker. On occasion, though, after a particularly traumatic adventure, he has sealed himself up behind the Spider-Man persona, and once or twice, a darker persona, referred to as "The Spider", has emerged.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid">Peter David</a> did a series where Peter Parker was locked up and doped up in a sanitarium, where Peter came to terms with "The Spider". And it wasn't particularly darker than Peter or Spider-Man.
</li><li> "The Spider" is the nickname his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery">Rogues Gallery</a> has given to Spider-Man whenever he's not talking and joking. This more than anything else scares the crap out of them.
</li><li> One of the scariest things in the entire Marvel universe isn't Wolverine, or Venom, or even Carnage. It's Spider-Man, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintItBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintItBlack">in the black costume</a> <em>and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterIsSeriousBusiness">not talking</a>.</em>
</li><li> A few instances have suggested that Spider-Man is essentially the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GIFT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GIFT">G.I.F.T.</a> version of Peter Parker. Peter Parker is normally introverted and socially reserved. Spider-Man is Peter Parker with anonymity and an audience and as a result his own social restraint has been removed. Spider-Man is much more assertive and has an inability to stop telling bad jokes.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn">The Green Goblin</a> is a rare villainous example, one of the few bad guys who continues the life of a secret costumed villain long after being exposed (to the hero and readers, and then even to the in-universe public). In his case the identity problem is due to actual mental illness, as he suffers from schizophrenia, manic depression and psychotic breaks from reality, and originally and occasionally full blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality">multiple personality disorder</a>, not to mention the odd bout of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdentityAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdentityAmnesia">Identity Amnesia</a>, and this all <em>apart</em> from his base anti-social, obsessive-compulsive, paranoid and narcissistic tendencies. To explain:
<ul><li> Norman Osborn originally was basically a bad man, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> at the best of times, struggling with being a single father and his own anger problems, while engaging in barely legal activities aimed at increasing his money and power.
</li><li> The Green Goblin is his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> alter ego he originally assumed after the accident that gave him superpowers caused him to snap, and became a sort of fantasy life for him to live out his more megalomaniacal dreams in, such as controlling the criminal underworld. The Goblin is violent, sadistic, reckless and utterly psychopathic, and represents Osborn's homicidal impulses. Osborn is initially not in total control of himself as the Goblin and, if pressed (such as reminding Osborn of his son) the Goblin can manifest as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality">Split Personality</a> who will argue with the slightly meeker Norman.
</li><li> Osborn became nicer after his first bout of amnesia; his first thoughts were to ask where his son was. He seemed shaken by his previous events even if he didn't quite remember what happened, but though he seemingly made a genuine effort to be better around people - notably supporting Peter - he could still engage in petty and morally questionable acts; in a retcon it was this Osborn (subconsciously with the Goblin) who took advantage of Gwen Stacy, and suffered from anger and stress problems that, when they overwhelmed him, resulted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">the goblin taking over</a>.
</li><li> Following his record breaking 27-year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookDeath">Comic Book Death</a>, Osborn came back and this, the modern version, is generally considered to be the "real" Osborn, the man he always wanted to be - a confident, disciplined, wealthy, ruthless, sadistic power-hungry sociopath with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">a positive public image</a> who swings from seeking bloody vengeance on Peter Parker, to viewing him as a surrogate son and trying to turn him to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSide">Dark Side</a>, to simply resigning himself to enjoying their "games" and viewing their fights as a fun hobby that saved him from a life as "just another boring industrialist". For a long time, he appears to have his mental issues more or less under control and the Green Goblin becomes basically just a costume he puts on for thrills or when he needs to get his hands dirty. However, during <em>Dark Reign</em>, the Goblin persona starts assuming a life of its own again and he finds it harder and harder to control his murderous and maniacal urges, eventually killing subordinates for petty criticisms and even painting his face green during the final battle.
</li><li> At the end of <em>Goblin Nation</em>, the Goblin serum is completely flushed from Osborn's body, and he ends it monologuing that for the first time in years he is entirely sane and knows exactly who he is. And Spider-Man's never faced <em>that</em> Green Goblin before...
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a> has said that Wade Wilson died during the Weapon X project. Whatever remained of his shattered psyche was Deadpool. He still answers to Wade Wilson, but his grotesque appearance makes a civilian life impossible. Oh, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">there's that whole thing of whether or not he ever was Wade Wilson or if that was</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">T-Ray</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Superman">Superman</a> goes up and down the spectrum, depending on series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">and writer</a>. During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeofComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeofComicBooks">the Silver Age</a>, the "real" persona seemed to be Kal-El; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis">Post-Crisis</a>, it's more Clark Kent. He's always "Clark" with his adopted parents, though. A key point in the plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KingdomCome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KingdomCome">Kingdom Come</a></em> is that Superman has begun to lose his humanity, becoming less "Clark" and more "Kal-El".
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBronzeAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBronzeAgeOfComicBooks">Bronze Age</a> story <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCComicsPresents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCComicsPresents">DC Comics Presents</a> #85: <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJungleLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJungleLine">The Jungle Line</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a> featured Superman getting infected by a Kryptonian disease. The disease causes hallucinations comprised of two figures, similar to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAngelBadAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAngelBadAngel">Good Angel, Bad Angel</a>, one of whom thought he should accept it because death comes to us all, while the other one insisted he had a duty to fight it off. The defeatist appeared as an empty suit with glasses hovering above it, and the fighter as an empty Superman costume. Both referred to him as "Kal" and to each other as "Clark" and "Superman". At the end he wakes up, insisting he invented both of them, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">neither are real</a>.
</li><li> In team-ups with Batman, it is generally accepted that Superman is the mask of Clark Kent whereas Bruce Wayne is the mask of Batman. The idea is that (implied or not, even true or not in the universe at the time) these relations reflect the divergent nature of the two. Bruce is a human that has grown to hate humanity and has symbolically abandoned it, embracing darkness. Clark Kent on the other hand is an alien that has largely embraced the ideas of humanity (in some continuities, he has gone so far as to embrace them for a lack of morality in his Kryptonian heritage e.g. in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em>, many Kryptonians believe him to be weak for caring for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyHumans">Puny Humans</a>), and finds strength in the light.
</li><li> This aspect is probably best demonstrated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark">Lois &amp; Clark</a></em> when - during a phone conversation with his parents, they warn him that he's started talking about himself in third person.
<ul><li> Notably: In the scene he refers to <em>both</em> Clark and Superman in third person.
</li><li> But in another scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark">Lois &amp; Clark</a></em>, after Lois finally understands the real relationship between Clark Kent and Superman, he says "Superman is what I can do. Clark is who I am", which contradicts the points above.
</li></ul></li><li> The revised <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupermanBirthright" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupermanBirthright">Superman: Birthright</a></em> posits that Clark Kent <em>and</em> Superman are masks, and that the "real" Kal-El is "Smallville Clark", i.e. the way he acts when around his parents and close friends who know his true origins.
<ul><li> Essentially, Clark Kent, renowned reporter, is the man he must be in order to protect the secrets of Superman, who is the man he must be in order to fulfill the moral obligations he feels.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em> provides a new option. Superman is the real persona, but only because that's the man Jonathan and Martha Kent raised him to be.
<ul><li> Or perhaps more precisely: Superman <em>is</em> Clark Kent, minus the need to keep his abilities secret.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries">Superman: The Animated Series</a></em> makes it pretty clear that Clark is the real identity. In "The Late Mr. Kent", when Clark Kent "dies", Superman is much more upset about it than Ma and Pa Kent.
<div class="indent"><strong>Pa Kent:</strong> It's not like he's really dead Martha, he just can't be Clark anymore. <br/><strong>Superman:</strong> But I <em>am</em> Clark, I <em>need</em> to be Clark. I'd go crazy if I had to be Superman all the time!
</div></li><li> Interestingly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/QuentinTarantino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/QuentinTarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a> posited a rather nihilistic and controversial view of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentityIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentityIdentity">Secret Identity Identity</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillBill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillBill">Kill Bill</a></em>; granted, it was his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> delivering the lines, in an attempt to convince the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> that she's not cut out for being anything other than an assassin — to force the exact same identity crisis on her:

<div class="indent">"Remember, Kent was not Superman's true identity as Bruce Wayne was Batman's or (on radio) Lamont Cranston, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheShadow">The Shadow</a>'s. Just the opposite. Clark Kent was the fiction... Superman only had to wake up in the morning to be Superman. In his case, Clark Kent was the put on... The truth may be that Kent existed not for the purposes of the story but the reader. He is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou">Superman's opinion of the rest of us</a>, a pointed caricature of what we, the noncriminal element, were really like. His fake identity was our real one. That's why we loved him so."
</div></li><li> Others accept the premise that Clark is the mask, but come to the opposite conclusion: that Clark Kent is what Superman thinks a man <em>ought</em> to be. Thus Clark is the "good side", and evidence of Superman's admiration for the human race, which can produce men of good character despite the lack of physical power that he has. This concept was best demonstrated in the famous <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3dxb5OpIw">Superman vs Clark Kent<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> scene in Superman III, (usually agreed to be the only redeeming scene of that movie).

He decides to spend at least a week as Clark and finds that he has more backbone — standing up to those who antagonize him as Clark, being more romantic with Lois, and engaging in a low-gravity battle with Intergang. However, helplessly watching huge disasters unfolding was too much for him to bear. Later, he decides not to fall back on Clark as Superman, forced to be fully committed to world welfare and leaving him unable to unwind and spend time with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle">muggle</a> friends. In the end, he decides not to discard either identity, and figures out the source of the split-effect in time to stop the years-long scheme of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">The Chessmaster</a> trying to destroy the world.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a> reboot, Clark's landlady (after discovering his secret identity) asks him if he's Clark Kent pretending to be Superman, or if he's Superman pretending to be Clark Kent. He doesn't answer her.
</li><li> Michael Fleischer speculated that if Krypton had not been destroyed, Kal-El would have been more like Clark Kent. Like his dad, he'd have a brilliant mind and do extraordinary things, but might be a bit shy and diffident, unsure if he could live up to Jor-El's reputation.

<ul><li> Back in the Silver and Bronze Ages, Kara Zor-El was torn between her responsibilities as Supergirl and her desire to be a normal woman and lead a normal life. Unlike her cousin -whose "real" person was Superman in those decades-, she thought of herself as "Linda Danvers", and sometimes she felt frustrated because she spent so long being Supergirl that she forgot what being "Linda" was like. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl1982" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl1982">Supergirl Vol 2 #1</a></em>:
<div class="indent"><strong>Supergirl:</strong> Besides, I could do with the time to myself... to sit back and think. It's selfish, I know, but I deserve... Whoa! There you go again, Linda! <br/>There's nothing selfish about wanting to get into yourself for a while instead of thinking about the whole blasted world! I do enough of that as Supergirl  and wasn't the whole reason for this move... to give myself space to be just plain Linda Danvers? <br/>I've been Supergirl for such a long time, it seems. Not that I'd give that up for anything... but I feel like I've totally lost hold of the part of me that doesn't scoot around the universe in shorts and a cape! I've forgotten what it feels like to be just a person... Instead of a symbol!
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl2005" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl2005">Post-Crisis Kara Zor-El</a> was Supergirl 24/7 until her cousin warned her that she would eventually burn out and suggested that she came up with a secret identity. Kara created a civilian identity called Linda Lang, but it was merely a disguise. After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">failing to save New Krypton</span> she briefly considered giving up on being Supergirl and becoming Linda permanently.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl2011">Post-Flashpoint Supergirl</a> was given a secret identity in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SupergirlRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SupergirlRebirth">Supergirl (Rebirth)</a></em>. However, "Kara Danvers" was merely a tool to socialize with humans and understand them in order to protect them better.
<div class="indent">"Kara Danvers" is a tool for you to walk amongst the people you protect.
</div></li><li> Of course, the difference between Superman and Supergirl is that Superman was sent to Earth as an infant. Supergirl actually lived on Krypton until she was... uh... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">however old she's considered to be as of the last reboot</a> - a teenager at the youngest. As such, she comes standard with an identity all her own, and putting on a superhero outfit lets her be her Kryptonian self. It's understandable why Kara is the mask.
</li></ul></li><li> There's a very, very fun story in JLA #51-54 where Superman's wish that the League's members didn't have "two lives" is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">granted</a> by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie">sixth-dimensional wishing machine</a>.

Aquaman finds himself in human and amphibian forms, while Wonder Woman is separated from clay, and she saves the day as the spirit of truth</span>.
<ul><li> Clark Kent without Superman becomes truly timid and afraid of heights, while Superman without Clark loses touch with humanity ("call me Kal", changing to a Kryptonian-style costume).
</li><li> Bruce Wayne without Batman has no outlet for his rage at the corruption of the world (beating two thugs nearly to death over spray-painting his car), while Batman without Bruce has no motivation and barely speaks - beneath the mask, he has no face.

</li><li> Wally West without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a> becomes lazy and apathetic, while the Flash forgets the legacy of those who came before him.

<ul><li> Eventually, it's Eel who realizes that everyone is slowly going nuts while separated and assembles the civilian identities to join back up and save the world as just six dudes. The message? The man behind the mask is <em>both</em>, or it doesn't work - for example, Superman is at his truest when he's at home in Smallville being Clark Kent with superpowers.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Christopher Chance, The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HumanTarget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HumanTarget">Human Target</a>, is a private detective/bodyguard who protects his clients by impersonating them to draw any would-be killers out. However, in modern stories, he is so good at his impersonations that he sometimes forgets his own identity in the process.
</li><li> Rorschach in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em> takes it so far that he calls his Rorschach-test-shaped mask his "face"; when he's unmasked, he screams <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">at the police</span> for them to give his face back. He claims that before he had to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog">Shoot the Dog</a> he was simply "[Walter] Kovacs pretending to be Rorschach" and now it's the other way around.
<ul><li> Another indication of this is in one flashback to before Rorschach's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask">Becoming the Mask</a> moment, where we see him speaking normally instead of with his usual wobbly speech bubble and font. It's no wonder the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">prison psychologist</span> slowly starts to think of him as Rorschach instead of Kovacs.
</li></ul></li><li> Unlike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a> was not raised by mortals, which makes all the difference. For some time in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeofComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeofComicBooks">the Silver Age</a>, she was a full-time civilian. For about two decades <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis">Post-Crisis</a>, she had no secret identity at all. At all times, the Amazon Princess Diana is basically the real her.
</li><li> A <em>Secret Wars</em> spinoff had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FantasticFour">the Thing</a> fight his Ben Grimm persona to the death.
</li><li> One of the more unique aspects of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen">X-Men</a> is that they seem to have variable degrees of separation between their "superhero" and "civilian" personae. This is intentional: being a mutant isn't exactly something they can stop doing if they want to retire, and is often explicitly used as a metaphor for real-world ethnic, sexual, and religious identities. For example, many of the X-Men don't wear masks of any sort (Shadowcat, Emma Frost, Professor X, Beast) and seem to live quite openly and proudly as mutants. Though for decades Xavier concealed the fact that he was a mutant, he never really used "Professor X" as a secret identity because, being wheelchair-bound, he wasn't a field operative and thus few outside the X-Men and their allies even knew the team had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a> type leader.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1lwn2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1lwn2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1lwn2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Of those enemies who did know, Magneto would never have "outed" Xavier because of their long friendship, and others such as Apocalypse and Mister Sinister just didn't care.</span> Others will go to some extremes to hide who they are and will adapt quite elaborate secret identities (Nightcrawler, Angel) including the use of holographic projectors to make them appear "normal." This is even reflected in their codenames, which over time have become more like nicknames than any kind of serious attempt to hide their real names. Some have just dropped them all together, while others have started using them all the time, even in private conversations or when not in costume.
<ul><li> Archangel (Warren Worthington) cited Native tradition that the mask was an expression of true identity when confronted by X-Factor (former X-Men) members with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYoureInThereSomewhereFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYoureInThereSomewhereFight">"I Know You're in There Somewhere" Fight</a>.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Marvel</a>, it was originally explained that their original names were (if you will) "slave names", and their codenames were effectively their new "real" names. (This reflected the continued influence of Magneto's ideology on Professor X even after their breakup.)
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BoosterGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BoosterGold">Booster Gold</a> is an interesting example, as his secret identity and his real identity are still Booster Gold. To the whole world, especially the superhero community, he presents himself as a selfish, bumbling fool who will do anything for fame. Secretly, he's a true and noble hero charged with protecting the timeline.
<ul><li> Even before Booster took up his role as timeline defender, he lacked an alter-ego - he was Booster pretty much all the time. Of course, his civilian identity <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">hasn't been born yet</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Steve Rogers is really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>, so much so that it's hard for him to be a normal person. There was an incident in one Captain America comic where Cap confided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hawkeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hawkeye">Hawkeye</a> about how uneasy the hero worship made him feel, how he was worried about being mobbed whenever he went out, etc. Hawkeye responded by pulling Cap's mask off and saying something along the lines of "Yeah, I can see how that would be a real problem, <em>Steve!</em>" - Cap had to be <em>reminded</em> that he didn't have to be Captain America all the time, that he could take the mask off and just be an ordinary person.
<ul><li> In effect, his costume is mostly just for protection and identification during fights rather than any sort of means to conceal his identity. Thus he doesn't see it as a mask but just something he wears.
</li></ul></li><li> This happens with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">Thor</a> and his various alter egos A LOT, primarily because most of those alter egos are actual, separate entities; Donald Blake was a construct created by Odin for Thor to inhabit to learn humility, and Eric Masterson and Jake Olson were human beings whom Thor bonded with to save their lives. The only "classic" secret identity Thor maintained was construction worker "Sigurd Jarlson", essentially Thor in street clothes and Clark Kent-ish glasses with his hair tied back.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> has gone through several identities. For a time it was pretty clear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">he didn't know who he was</a>.

</li><li> The Batman-is-real-Bruce-Wayne-is-the-mask idea is invoked but averted for Kate Kane in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batwoman">Batwoman</a></em> #0. Her narration says the obvious idea would be that Kate Kane went on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a>, and Batwoman returned. In fact, the confused woman who left didn't know <em>who</em> she was, and it was only once she became Batwoman that she felt like Kate Kane again.

<ul><li> Discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles">The Incredibles</a></em> at the very start, in an interview with the main characters. About ten minutes later it's deconstructed, when it turned out that Good Samaritan Laws and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroInsurance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroInsurance">Hero Insurance</a> just wasn't cutting it. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingAroundTrademarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingAroundTrademarks">Supers</a> have been <em>forced</em> to pick an identity, and whoever chose their Super identities were denied further citizenship (at least within the United States). Obviously none of them are happy about this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLEGOBatmanMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLEGOBatmanMovie">The LEGO Batman Movie</a></em> takes the idea of Batman being the real person and Bruce Wayne as the mask to its logical conclusion and deconstructs it. Batman never stops being Batman; even at home by himself, he always wears the mask and cape and talks in the same tone of voice. He has to be forced to be Bruce for public events, but doesn't act significantly different and doesn't like it. But since Batman exists to fight crime, there's nothing for him when there's no crime to fight. No personal life, no friends or family and he can't even leave the house for his meager hobbies. The Justice League doesn't even bother to invite him to their anniversary parties. A key part of the movie is basically Batman learning to get a life.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> saga, the Sith Lords see their Sith personas as their true identities and their original identities as their masks or separate entities that they have mentally destroyed.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Darth Sidious</a> wears a dark hood over his head to hide his identity, Senator/Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, from his Separatist conspirators. However, the real mask here is Palpatine, whose kind and noble appearance is merely public facade to hide his true nature until he wipes out the Jedi Order and turns the Republic into an Empire. From that point onwards, the newly proclaimed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Emperor</a> discards his Palpatine persona completely and becomes Sidious in both thought and action, wearing his cloaked hood full time despite no longer having any reason to use it anymore. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanMcDiarmid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanMcDiarmid">Ian McDiarmid</a> states that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Lucas</a> wanted Senator Palpatine's face in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace">The Phantom Menace</a></em> to appear the most artificial, with the implication that his post-Force Lightning face from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em> isn't really his disfigurement but rather his real face all this time.

It's only after he got horribly scarred in a duel with Obi-Wan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">and later learned that he indirectly killed his wife Padmé</a> that the fallen Jedi embraces Darth Vader as his one and only identity, even going as far as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatManIsDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatManIsDead">declaring that Anakin is dead and that he destroyed him personally</a>.

Turns out she was really an assassin with a head injury who ended up believing her cover. As she is much happier as a schoolteacher than an assassin it could be seen as a subconscious choice to live the mask.

</li><li> Some reference material for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones">Indiana Jones</a></em> raises the question of whether his "real" self is the mild-mannered (yet charismatic) professor Dr. Henry Jones, or the globetrotting adventurer Indiana Jones. Although neither identity is really a secret from the world or ostensibly separate from the other (he still conducts "archaeology" as Dr. Jones either way), it's implied that even he isn't sure.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheYoungIndianaJonesChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheYoungIndianaJonesChronicles">The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles</a></em>, Indy first puts on his trademark hat when he stops hanging back from danger and moves to challenge it head on.

<div class="indent"><strong>V</strong>: There is a face beneath this mask, but it's not me. I am no more that face then I am the muscles beneath it, or the bones beneath that. <br/>... <br/><strong>Finch:</strong> Who was he? <br/><strong>Evey:</strong> He was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCountOfMonteCristo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCountOfMonteCristo">Edmund Dantes</a>. And he was my father... and my mother. My brother. My friend. He was you... ...and me. He was all of us.
</div></li><li> The question is begged of Bruce Banner in a deleted scene from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a></em>: "Are you a big guy that gets all little, or a little guy who sometimes blows up big?" Banner himself is unsure of the answer.
</li><li> This is a recurring theme in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em> films. Interestingly, while everyone else insists that Iron Man is just the suit of armor Tony wears, Tony Stark is insistent that he and Iron Man are one and the same. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan3">third film</a> goes as far as to contrast Iron Man and Tony Stark less in terms of the mask and more in terms of overall behavior: Iron Man is a hero who tries to make things better for the world, and Tony Stark is a partying narcissist who makes things worse for himself and the world as a whole, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain">often by carelessly inspiring or enabling others to become villains.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManOfSteel">Man of Steel</a></em> brings a possible <em>third</em> interpretation into the Superman mythos: Clark and Superman are one and the same, with minimal effort taken to make each identity distinct. Clark's disguise is paper-thin because it's all he <em>needs</em> it to be since most people really don't think Superman <em>has</em> a secret identity.
</li><li> Discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillBill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillBill">Kill Bill</a></em> where Bill points out that Clark Kent is actually the secret identity of Superman and not the other way around. Superman has to put on a show of being Clark Kent, but beneath the surface he's Superman all the time.
<div class="indent"><strong>Bill</strong>: Superman didn't become Superman. Superman was born Superman. When Superman wakes up in the morning, he's Superman. His alter ego is Clark Kent. [...] What Kent wears - the glasses, the business suit - that's the costume. That's the costume Superman wears to blend in with us. Clark Kent is how Superman views us. And what are the characteristics of Clark Kent. He's weak... he's unsure of himself... he's a coward. Clark Kent is Superman's critique on the whole human race.
</div><ul><li> Ironically, this was written during the era where DC was most adamant about Clark Kent being the person and Superman being the secret identity. During this period, Clark was a bestselling author and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo">Perry White's natural heir as leader of the ''Daily Planet'' newsroom</a>.

It is also odd is that Dantes creates other personas: Busoni, an intellectual and pious Italian priest who seems to be modeled after Faria who tutored him in prison, and Lord Wilmore, an eccentric British philanthropist who is an enemy of the Count. Thus, Dantes essentially divided the different parts of his personality into different identities, and his main identity as the Count represents his darker side. He ultimately ends up showing some kindness and mercy (after one of his revenges went too far), and at the end of the novel signs a friendly letter as "Edmond Dantes, Count of Monte Cristo", thus reconciling the identities.

See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlterEgoActing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlterEgoActing">Alter-Ego Acting</a>.
</li><li> In fact, Sellers' fascination with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeingThere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeingThere">Chance the Gardener</a> stemmed from this. Preferring to lose himself in characters to set aside his own personal flaws and make audiences, those close to him, and himself happy, Sellers was quite understanding of Chance's situation as someone who made others happy solely by reflecting what others wanted.
</li><li> According to some who have worked with him, satirist Daniel Whitney is slowly vanishing behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryTheCableGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryTheCableGuy">Larry the Cable Guy</a> (which has also gone from being a satirical character he did at the end of his stand up routines to being the whole thing and losing the satire). Talk about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a>...
<ul><li> It's very telling that even in an interview with <em>60 Minutes</em>, Whitney appeared in character as Larry—somewhat muted from his on-stage behavior, but still very much Larry. Either Whitney is dedicated to the pretense that Larry the Cable Guy is who he really is, or the <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/QIWO5LgUZ28">Dan Whitney of his initial stand-up career<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was the real pretense, and he's a better actor than anyone gives him credit for.
</li><li> One concerning thing is that when he voiced Mater for <em>Cars</em>, he requested to be (and was) credited as Larry the Cable Guy, not Daniel Whitney.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a> stated in interviews that he was terrified of the possibility of completely becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRiseAndFallOfZiggyStardustAndTheSpidersFromMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRiseAndFallOfZiggyStardustAndTheSpidersFromMars">Ziggy Stardust</a>. He stopped adopting such specific stage personas in 1977, after — with the "help" of his cocaine addiction at the time — the heartless Thin White Duke of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StationToStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StationToStation">Station to Station</a></em> came close to consuming him.
</li></ul></li><li> "Witty Ticcy Ray", a Tourette's sufferer (including a limited degree of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTourettes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTourettes">Hollywood Tourette's</a>) in <em>The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat</em> believed he had to fight off his disorder from eclipsing his real personality.
</li><li> Former professional wrestler The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UltimateWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UltimateWarrior">Ultimate Warrior</a> changed his name from Jim Hellwig to Warrior after leaving wrestling. Almost all the wrestlers who worked with him recounted him as being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">egotistical asshole</a> even outside the ring. But all those wrestlers mostly worked with him after he'd gotten famous. The people who'd known him before recounted that Jim Hellwig was a nice, soft-spoken friendly guy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimRoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimRoss">Jim Ross</a> suggested that he'd ended up fighting his in-ring persona, and the persona won. As he got more famous, the moments where he was Jim grew less and less.
</li><li> In <em>Beyond the Mat</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> says of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JakeRoberts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JakeRoberts">Jake the Snake</a>: "I was never able to tell the difference between Jake Roberts the performer and Jake Roberts the person, because frankly I never knew which one I was talking to. I don't know that they're not the same."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ElSanto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ElSanto">El Santo</a> lived in his wrestling mask his entire career, going so far as to have chinless masks that allowed him to eat while costumed. He briefly removed the mask <em>just once</em> in an interview to bid goodbye to his fans. He was even buried in it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JorgeLuisBorges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JorgeLuisBorges">Jorge Luis Borges</a> wrote the short story <em>"Borges and I"</em> to explain the curios relationship between the normal person <em>he</em> was, and Borges, the literature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredCow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredCow">Sacred Cow</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SophisticatedAsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SophisticatedAsHell">Sophisticated as Hell</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanSnarker">Gentleman Snarker</a> construct <em>he</em> had created and his public were expecting to meet.
