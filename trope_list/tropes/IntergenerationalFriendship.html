Only, one is about twice, or even three times the other person's age! Considering their differences in life experiences and worldviews, how do they relate? What could they possibly have in common? Assuming this is actually a platonic friendship and not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry">something far more sinister</a>, or for that matter an overtly stated mentoring situation, intergenerational friendships can be pretty weird. As the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> section indicates, while not everyone finds older or younger people completely unapproachable, there's still frequently a gap there.
</p><p>This can take the form of a young adult from one generation befriending someone old enough to be their parent or even grandparent, such as in the comedy <em>Finding Forrester</em>. It can take the form of an adult befriending a misguided or vulnerable youth, as in the French film <em>Leon</em>. Sometimes, the two happen to have more in common than they think, such as having surprisingly similar life experiences. Sometimes the younger generation is more mature, or the older generation is less mature - the latter especially helps writers to dodge away from worrying questions being asked about sexual attraction.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>As for how they become friends, it could well be contrived circumstances that bring them together, or a shared life experience. Sometimes it's a teacher trying to help a troubled teen, leading to them becoming close friends. Either way, the situation that leads to their friendship would often be something out of the ordinary, since in real life, people of two widely different age groups generally do not reach out to each other.
</p><p>Sadly though, if it's an adult and a child who are friends, in modern stories, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForPedophile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForPedophile">expect someone to misinterpret it as being sexual</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt">and violence to possibly result</a>. Sometimes the younger one will have an innocent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush">Precocious Crush</a> on the older one.
</p><p>This trope does not generally apply if it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">parent-child relation</a> between the two.

At least in the movies, <em>how</em> they met and became friends is not explained. That relationship simply exists before the first movie begins.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> later explained that the friendship started when Marty was around 13-14 years old. After being told for years that Doc Brown was a dangerous, crackpot lunatic, he snuck into Doc's lab to see for himself and instead was fascinated by what he saw in there and thought Doc's inventions were cool. Doc found him and was happy Marty thought he was "cool and accepted him for what he was". Doc then gave Marty a part-time job helping out with experiments, helping in the lab, and feeding Einstein. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/97285">Read for yourself here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Later it was established that Doc actually sought Marty out when the timing was right due to his knowledge of their future friendship.
<ul><li> Doc Brown had the idea for the flux capacitor (the device that allows time travel) after hitting his head when he fell while hanging a wall clock. He may have fallen due to being distracted by Marty (having traveled from 1985 to 1955) calling him on the phone. Therefore, to preserve the timeline, Doc Brown must become friends with Marty, so Marty will film the testing of the time machine, go back to 1955, and enable the invention of the time machine. Ever wonder why a mad scientist obsessed with time travel and clocks converted one wall of his house into a huge guitar amp? Because he knew it would make Marty want to come over to his house repeatedly. And he had all of it planned out years before Marty was born, based on watching a video of himself describing inventing the time machine and a letter describing its first use, given to him by . . . Marty.

</li><li> Many books by Russian author Vladislav Krapivin feature this trope, with friendships between a child and a young adult, or a young adult and an elderly character.
</li><li> Cap'n Bill and Trot in Frank Baum's <em>Oz</em> books. She's the daughter of his first mate from when he was a sailor, they now wander around Oz together.
</li><li> Long John Silver and Jim Hawkins in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TreasureIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TreasureIsland">Treasure Island</a></em>, even more unusual when you consider that they spend at least half the book as antagonists. Silver is almost explicitly a replacement father figure. At least it explains why Jim, whose own father recently died, takes a liking to Silver despite having been warned about a one-legged pirate.
</li><li> The friendship between Antonio and Ultima (not only old enough to be his grandmother, but also helped his mother birth him) is one of the central points of <em>Bless Me, Ultima</em>.
</li><li> The page quote features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a> and Professor McGonagall, but the series also features Harry Potter and Hagrid, Harry Potter and Sirius Black, Harry Potter and Dumbledore, Harry Potter and...
<ul><li> And Sirius Black is his godfather and closest tie to a father that he very much admires (and never really knew).
</li><li> Dumbledore (116 <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when he died</span>) was a good friend of Nicolas Flamel (600)and Hagrid (in his 60´s)
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> Bilbo is nearly 80 years older than Frodo, yet they have a very close relationship.
<ul><li> Other examples from the books (and films) include the several hundred years old Legolas and the 140 year old Gimli, and the friendship bordering on father-son relationship between Merry and King Théoden. However, one of the most prominent examples is the bond that forms between Gandalf (the "grandfather" of the Fellowship) and Pippin (the "baby" of the Fellowship) when they ride off to Minas Tirith together.
</li><li> Frodo is in his fifties whereas Merry and Pippin are still very young; Pippin is still in his Tweens (the age between 20 and 33 when a Hobbit comes of age). The Fellowship ages vary wildly, therefore they all sort of fit this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> Quite unexpected bonds fitting this trope are found in Conn Iggulden's <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Emperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Emperor">Emperor</a></em> series between Caesar/Brutus and Renius, the elderly gladiator who trained them and tried to kill them in their early teens. The bond between Caesar and Renius is founded almost immediately after the older tried to kill the younger, and lasts to the point where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Renius dies trying to protect Caesar during the Battle of Alesia</span>. The bond between Brutus and Renius is somewhat shakier at first, with the former vowing to kill the latter for what he did to Caesar. Though after traveling with Renius to Greece, Brutus comes to view him as the father he never knew. It is however unclear if Renius ever really feels any stronger bonds towards Brutus.
<ul><li> Another such bond in the series is between Caesar and Octavius.
</li><li> Julius' friendship with Cabera. Caesar was all of 14 when he first meet Cabera, who was pushing eighty at the time, but is still strong and spry. When Cabera dies in the third book, it is close to twenty years later, though he had spent most of the decade-long campaign in Gaul partially disabled from a stroke suffered after using his quasi-magical healing gift on one of Julius' lieutenants.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFrogKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFrogKing">The Frog King</a></em>, the main character Harry has a friendship with a homeless girl called Birdie.
</li><li> Nearly every kids' novel written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnBellairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnBellairs">John Bellairs</a> features a relationship like this. Usually it is between a smart preteen who doesn't fit in with his/her peers and an eccentric elderly person who treats the kid like an equal, and they face the supernatural menace of the week together. Later on in each series, the kid usually brings in one or two new friends his/her own age who also become fast friends with the old person. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHouseWithAClockInItsWalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHouseWithAClockInItsWalls">Lewis Barnavelt</a> had his Uncle Jonathan and Mrs. Zimmermann, who he introduced to Rose Rita Pottinger. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCurseOfTheBlueFigurine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCurseOfTheBlueFigurine">Johnny Dixon</a> had Professor Roderick Childermass, who he introduced to Fergie. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTreasureOfAlpheusWinterborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTreasureOfAlpheusWinterborn">Anthony Monday</a> became friends with the elderly Ms Eells and her brother Emerson.

It continues in <em>Only In Death</em>. In <em>Blood Pact</em>, Merrt comes along to give Dalin moral support when he tells Hark about the twin.
</li><li> Canadian teen novel <em>Jack's Knife</em> has a 14-year-old boy who lives with his overprotective mother, and an elderly man who served as a police officer and is also very knowledgeable about survival skills, as friends. The mother doesn't want her son hanging around this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy">Cool Old Guy</a>, and is completely against the relationship, always suspecting the worst.
</li><li> A feature in the Haruki Murakami books <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWindUpBirdChronicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWindUpBirdChronicle">The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DanceDanceDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DanceDanceDance">Dance Dance Dance</a></em>, both which feature a thirty-something year old man befriending a young teenage girl.

Fireheart also becomes good friends with Yellowfang, who is old enough to be his mother or grandmother; in return, Yellowfang considers Fireheart <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeASonToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeASonToMe">the son she wished</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrantTakesTheHelm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrantTakesTheHelm">Brokenstar was</a>.

<ul><li> That relationship falls into the traditional category as well. Dax's previous host, Curzon, was significantly older than Sisko when they originally met and became friends.

With one exception, none of the playable cast is over 21; that exception being Raven, who at 35 gets the somewhat sarcastic nickname "Old Man".
</li><li> Several examples are possible in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> series, thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">support system</a>. Among the more notable ones is Amelia (~15) and Duessel (old enough to be her grandfather, likely in his mid 50') from <em>The Sacred Stones</em>, who even get a double-ending where Amelia becomes Duessel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">"most trusted companion"</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The fact that Duessel reunites Amelia with her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">Missing Mom</a> Melina, whom he rescued from the bandits who kidnapped her when Amelia was a child, probably helps a lot.</span>

</li><li> Similarly, there's Scootaloo and Rainbow Dash, with the former idolizing and admiring the latter who fulfills something of a sisterly role.
</li><li> Both Princesses act the most "adult" out of any of the characters on the show, being both in their twenties to thirties emotionally and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">at least a thousand years old each chronologically</a>.

<ul><li> Message boards, online games and other websites where people who share a common interest gather.

</li><li> Dame Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev. Best friends, best ballet partners... and she was 19 years older than him. In fact, Dame Margot was about to retire when they started dancing together, but then she decided otherwise and they were a ballet duo for fifteen more years.

</li><li> Animal example: A baby hippopotamus that was rescued after floods in Kenya made news everywhere when it befriended a 100-year old tortoise in a wildlife sanctuary.

In fact their friendship is so close, and the two are so open about indicating their love and affection for one another - with Coleman directly identifying Capaldi as one of her best friends and Capaldi speaking at length at how unusual it is for two people of their disparate ages to have such a friendship - that a subset of <em>Doctor Who</em> fandom began to ship <em>the actors</em>, despite Capaldi having been happily married for nearly as long as Coleman has been alive.
