Some have become huge stars in their own right. Unfortunately, as these new opportunities grew, a new dark side of 'racial' bias emerged.
</p><p>Or should we say: "a new <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">light</a></em> side."
</p><p>Fair skin is a common beauty standard by some cultures, one strengthened by Euro-centrism ('the West'<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note070cv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note070cv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note070cv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Europe west of Belarus, the former self-governing territories of the British Empire (Australia, etc. etc.), and the USA </span> produces or influences the majority of the world's media). However, most of the world's population is possessed of brown skin tones of varying shades. As the trope title states, this hits ethnic Africans particularly hard; some 'Western' casting directors are in the habit of only—or mostly—hiring non-European actors and actresses with lighter skin tones because they assume that they will be more relatable to their largely ethnic-European audiences. Black actresses are hit even harder (<a class="urllink" href="http://www.teenvogue.com/story/hollywoods-colorism-problem-cant-be-ignored?mbid=social_twitter">as detailed here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) due to Eurocentric beauty standards favoring fair skin for women.

For example, an Asian actor might be asked to cover his eyes or a black actress asked to straighten her hair. Colourism is a subset of "degreeism" in which members of a marginalized group rank themselves based on how closely they resemble the dominant group.
</p><p>Variations of this casting trope are also seen in Latin America, Northern Africa/Western Asia, and East Asia. This trope is a common source of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a>; given this trope's prevalence throughout the world's entertainment industries, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreFlexible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreFlexible">there are numerous variations on this trope listed below</a>. Note also how the changing definitions of desirability have resulted in new and/or different hiring biases over time.

</p><p>Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWhitestBlackGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWhitestBlackGuy">The Whitest Black Guy</a> for when black characters are said to be 'acting white' as opposed to 'looking white.'

</li><li> The skin-lightening cream "Fair and Lovely" is sold in India and the Middle East. The commercials often feature pretty women who feel insecure because of their dark skin, and sometimes feel it's holding them back for some reason or another. But here's what makes them fall directly into this trope: <em>the women already have very light skin to begin with.</em> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIUQ5hbRHXk">This is one of the ads,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and there are plenty of others. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">Unilever, also makes Dove soaps and shampoos, which has been having one of those "Feel beautiful in your own body!" campaigns in the US.</a> This is more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> as in India, lightening your skin is considered the same as getting a tan is in the West. However even among some Indians this is viewed rather negatively.
<ul><li> The same kinds of creams appeared in African-American periodicals right up until the late 70s. While the language became more subtle throughout the years (referring to skin as "glowing" rather than "light"), the before and after pictures always gave away the underlying message: you're not pretty if you're dark.
</li><li> It has been noted that skin creams that lighten your skin, that are sharply targeted towards blacks and Asians, are considered to be dangerous (physically, not just socially!). Decades ago there was a much worse product aimed at black people in the US to 'lighten' their skin. It involved giving them a hefty dose of X-rays. It lightened their skin, all right, and killed a good many of them rather quickly as well. In primarily Indian or Pakistani neighborhoods in Dubai, there are billboards advertising skin lightening cream. The model on the billboard is usually a very light skinned Indian in a business suit. Obviously, this is meant to imply that having lighter skin will increase your chances of being successful. Skin lightening creams are also popular in India. Most Bollywood actresses are very light, because it's very difficult for dark-skinned women to get acting jobs in India. Even in South Indian regional films, directors often prefer to cast North Indian actresses, as they tend to be fairer. And like Beyonce, they can be made to look even lighter on camera. There are a few actresses with tan or wheatish skin, who are often touted as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">"dark beauties"</a>, but rarely do you find truly dark actresses. Parminder Nagra (E.R. and Alcatraz), considered by some to be one of the most beautiful women in the world does have skin color about middle or average for Indian, but you wouldn't know it from her IMDB cover photo however ...
</li><li> There's a market in Kenya and Uganda where women buy products that bleaches their skin. It's outlawed in Kenya, but they are still able to buy the products due to smuggling. The products in question are extremely unhealthy, since it gives the women cancer and causes chronic skin poisoning. They use it anyway, because they want to look prettier. What's worse is that they are all encouraged by the culture, assumed than women with a lighter skin have more advantages than a woman with the average black skin.
</li><li> In some places is assumed that women with a lighter skin have more advantages than a woman with the average black skin, a huge medical concern in the Caribbean, where darker women are literally rubbing laundry bleach on their and their children's skin.

</li><li> Particularly jarring contrasts abound in some East Asian countries where ads with white models are fairly common; the native Asian models are often so heavily whitened they look <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">paler than the actual white models</a></em>.

When the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">anime</a> rolled around, it depended on the artist but she was often as light as the others. In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SeraMyu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SeraMyu">Sera Myu</a></em> musicals, she almost always, if not always, has the same skin tone as everyone else.
</li><li> An aversion: In the manga version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetBackers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetBackers">Get Backers</a></em>, Kudou Himiko was originally shown to have slightly darker skin than the rest of the cast. As the series progressed and gained a serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a>, her skin got darker and darker until, by the time the manga ended, she was closer in skin tone to black characters than the rest of the white cast. (Her race or ethnic background is never addressed, and her brother was drawn with a similar skin color.) The anime kept her at "slightly darker than the main cast", looking more like she just had a tan than she was of a different ethnicity than the main cast.
</li><li> A case of this appears in the adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em> from manga to anime. The manga gave the characters a variety of skin tones, but in the anime everyone except for Cuba was the same color, with Seychelles and Egypt being particularly noticeable examples. This was eventually fixed in season five when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioDeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioDeen">Studio DEEN</a> brought in a new animation team.

<ul><li> Though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Storm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Storm">Storm</a> is quite dark, she has white hair and blue eyes (when they're not completely whited out when she uses her powers), said to be marks of her bloodline, and for years was drawn with semi-European features. This comes from an early idea to give her features from different races — dark skin, light hair and Asian-featured eyes — to make her resemble Gaia. Later works, particularly during the lead-up to her marriage to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackPanther">Black Panther</a>, actually drew mild fan criticism for the change of her facial structure.
</li><li> X-Men colorists must be fond of this trope, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MonetStCroix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MonetStCroix">M</a>'s skin tone is in a constant state of flux.

When she first appeared in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GenerationX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GenerationX">Generation X</a></em> she had caramel skin. Towards the end of the book it was chocolate. When she was floating between titles it went back to caramel. During her stint in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor2006">X-Factor</a></em>, she could be, and was, mistaken for white by readers. She had very pale skin, along with turquoise eyes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">PAD</a> mentioned getting complaints from fans, who wondered why Monet was suddenly white. In response, they mentioned gradually making her darker again. So by the run's end, her skin was more caramel-looking, but still very light.

Currently, she's in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GenerationX2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GenerationX2017">Generation X (2017)</a></em> upon <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ResurrXion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ResurrXion">Resurr Xion</a></em>, and her complexion has become more lighte caramel again.

Sunspot is Brazilian, specifically of mixed-race Afro-Brazilian and White Brazilian descent and was drawn with dark skin with wavy hair and black features.

Fox finally cast a Brazilian actor, Henry Zaga, as Sunspot for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNewMutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNewMutants">The New Mutants</a></em> but he is very light-skinned.

</li><li> Depending on who is drawing him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KarateKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KarateKid">Karate Kid</a> from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></em> often looks <em>extremely</em> white despite being half-Japanese. In at least some cases, this is due to the fact that his Japanese heritage itself was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a>; the character was clearly white when he was first introduced.
</li><li> Ellie Preston, the daughter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a></em> suffered this big time in Gerry Duggan's volume 3 of the series. She's almost as bad as Monet. When she first appeared in-person during the Original Sin tie-ins, she was chocolate, with black hair. No denying her as (mixed) black. At the end of the tie-in, her skin is Caramel. After the tie-ins are finished her skin is white, her hair is a light brown &amp; and her facial features have changed. This happened frequently throughout volume 3, where Ellie could be black one chapter and white the next. Finally, once volume 4 started in 2016, she has consistently been depicted as more black — with a brown complexion and black hair, a bit closer to what she originally was.
</li><li> Similarly, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ImmortalIronFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ImmortalIronFist">Immortal Iron Fist</a></em> series has occasional "lapses" where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MistyKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MistyKnight">Misty Knight</a> is drawn with a shag haircut and European features.
</li><li> There was a bit of a mini-controversy for the second volume of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MightyAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MightyAvengers">Mighty Avengers</a></em>.

This was later addressed in an issue where Monica was shown to be horrified when a little black girl said she wanted to straighten her hair to look like Monica's, and she's since gone back to her dreadlocked look.
</li><li> The people behind the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> continuation series has been criticized for lightening Katara and Sokka's brown skin tone by a couple of shades. Even Aang is pointed out as having his skin lightened.
</li><li> In the tie-in comics for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> cartoon, this occurred to the half-Vietnamese and half-white Artemis. Her skin is darker than Wally's in the cartoon, but in the comics she is presented as lighter skinned than in the source. She is also blue eyed when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is her eyes aren't supposed to be blue (and in the cartoons they look black). She more looks like her DC Comics design (who is completely white) rather than the <em>Young Justice</em> one.
</li><li> The <em>Girl</em> series by Kevin J.

Basically, she's her voice actress <a class="urllink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0741242/">Anika Noni Rose<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with big huge Disney eyes, though she's actually based off Danielle Mone Truitt, who served as her reference model, though the aversion still applies.
</li><li> In the early trailers for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RalphBreaksTheInternet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RalphBreaksTheInternet">Ralph Breaks the Internet</a></em>, Tiana seemed to be suffering from this in the group Disney Princess scenes. After enough fans complained about this trope, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">the crew went through the trouble of re-rendering Tiana's model to be closer to her original movie counterpart.</a>

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SpikeLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SpikeLee">Spike Lee</a> films:
<ul><li> <em>School Daze</em> references the old practice of black fraternities and sororities performing "the paper bag test" on their potential applicants - only those with skin lighter than a brown paper bag would be allowed in.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GetOnTheBus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GetOnTheBus">Get On The Bus</a></em> features a culture clash between a very light-skinned and Anglo-looking black man (played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductionPosse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductionPosse">Spike Lee Joint regular</a> Roger Guenveur Smith) and the darker black men on the bus. The rest of the bus riders see him as an outsider and criticize his anecdotes about his white mother.
</li></ul></li><li> Most light-skinned African-American actors benefit from this trope. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HalleBerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HalleBerry">Halle Berry</a> (White mother and Black father) is the most frequent example, being mixed race. Berry has also had plastic surgery on her nose, which had the effect of making her look more European.
</li><li> Mixed-race actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RaeDawnChong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RaeDawnChong">Rae Dawn Chong</a> is probably one of the earliest examples of a light-skinned actress constantly being paired up with white males.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnnaMayWong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnnaMayWong">Anna May Wong</a> - the first Chinese-American movie star in the Golden Age of Hollywood - was a victim to this. Despite her star power, producers were reluctant to cast her in lead roles. She usually ended up as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonLady">Dragon Lady</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautifulSlaveGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautifulSlaveGirl">Beautiful Slave Girl</a> supporting parts - while white actresses in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yellowface" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yellowface">Yellowface</a> got cast as leads. She ultimately had to take her career overseas to play non-stereotypical characters.
</li><li> Mixed-race actresses such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThandieNewton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThandieNewton">Thandie Newton</a>, Paula Patton, and Kandyse McClure (all of mixed white/black descent) are often paired with a white male co-star.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hairspray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hairspray">Hairspray</a></em> remake, it is kind of hard to listen to the light-skinned Queen Latifah sing the line "...with a darkness/as black as my skin" without thinking of this trope. Both the film and the musical have the song "Run and Tell That" with a chorus of: <em>"The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice, I can say it ain't so, but darling, what's the use? The darker the chocolate, the richer the taste, and that's where it's at, so run and tell that!"</em>
</li><li> A major plot point in both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ImitationOfLife1934" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ImitationOfLife1934">1934 version</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ImitationOfLife1959" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ImitationOfLife1959">1959 version</a> of <em>Imitation of Life</em>, in which a light-skinned biracial child really really wants to pass as white, causing much heartache and tragedy.

</li><li> Mixed race Lisa Bonet (half-Jewish and half-Black) claims to have turned down roles because of this trope.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WillSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WillSmith">Will Smith</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.today.com/popculture/was-race-issue-hitch-casting-wbna7019342">said<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EvaMendes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EvaMendes">Eva Mendes</a> was cast opposite him in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hitch">Hitch</a></em> because casting a black actress would have made it a "black movie" that would turn off white audiences. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereDaWhiteWomenAt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereDaWhiteWomenAt">And apparently so would have a white actress.</a> Likely why the kiss between Smith and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlizeTheron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlizeTheron">Charlize Theron</a> was cut in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hancock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hancock">Hancock</a></em>. So not even Will Smith at the height of his popularity, when he was considered a bigger box office draw than any white actor, was immune to this trope.
</li><li> In many "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceFilm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceFilm">Race Films</a>" (films made in the US by blacks for black audiences prior to the 60s), the female lead was typically played by a light-skinned black, sometimes so light she could be mistaken for white. Meanwhile, dark-skinned females were cast as the heroine's maid, or other servants. This also applied to the men less so, though it was still rare to see light-skinned blacks cast as porters and waiters. This still exists to a certain degree in current black media. See the silent film <em>Happiness</em>, the cowboy serial <em>The Creole Kid</em>, and 1939s <em>Moon Over Harlem</em>.
</li><li> <em>The Human Stain</em> covers this, as the protagonist's from a family of mixed Caucasian and African-American descent who's light enough to pass for white (to his brother's resentment-none of the rest can). Ironically it works <em>too well</em>, since everyone else believes this (he's made himself out to be Jewish as the explanation of his slightly swarthy skin and curly hair), thus he's accused of racism due to a misinterpreted remark about a couple absent students from his university class (both black). This was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnATrueStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnATrueStory">Based on a True Story</a>.
</li><li> Parodied in Robert Townsend's <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HollywoodShuffle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HollywoodShuffle">Hollywood Shuffle</a></em>. In the sketch about "Black Acting School," the host of the commercial asserts that Hollywood prefers dark-skinned black actors to play thugs and low-lifes, and implies that these are the only roles available to black men.
</li><li> Used in the French movie <em>99 Francs</em>: the CEO of a dairy company (a clear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of Danone) refuses to cast a black woman in a yogurt commercial (claiming it's "too much Africanity for our audience" and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">a Black girl will scare people</a>); the main character chooses to cast a fair-skinned girl from Maghreb (thus African as well) and nobody complains, the CEO even says <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">she looks less vulgar than any black girl would</a>, even though the audience knows she is a prostitute (Octave smiles to himself, and Charlie smiles at him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">while remembering it</a>). Considering the movie is the adaptation of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> against the advertising business, the whole point (rich, upper-class people can also be stupid, racist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">assholes</a>, even when they are worth tens of billions) is rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">then again....</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HaroldAndKumarEscapeFromGuantanamoBay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HaroldAndKumarEscapeFromGuantanamoBay">Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay</a></em>: Lampshaded with a light-skinned black security guard. Kumar accuses him of racism when is "randomly selected" to be searched. The security guards says he can't be racist because he's black, to which Kumar calls him barely black. Note that the guard could easily pass for white.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RosarioDawson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RosarioDawson">Rosario Dawson</a>'s mixed racial features allow her to play a variety of races and open up her opportunities for pairings. Similar to Eva Mendes, she can pair up with a white male, black male (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SevenPounds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SevenPounds">Seven Pounds</a></em>), and has even passed herself off as Middle Eastern (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alexander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alexander">Alexander</a></em>).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VinDiesel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VinDiesel">Vin Diesel</a>'s semi-autobiographical film <em>Multi-Facial</em> details the difficulties of a multiracial actor, who can't get parts because he's too black to play white but too white to play black. Diesel's star power has apparently allowed him to jumped the hurdle. He's even played a real-life Italian-American mafioso in Sidney Lumet's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FindMeGuilty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FindMeGuilty">Find Me Guilty</a>.</em>
</li><li> Wentworth Miller also overcame this. But most probably don't know his actual ethnic background, which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot">African-American/Jamaican/English/German/Jew/Cherokee/Russian/French/Dutch/Lebanese/Syrian</a>.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GetShorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GetShorty">Get Shorty</a></em>: Elmore Leonard's novel included several pages of dialogue between Chili and Harry about Bo Catlett's skin color — Harry, who'd known Bo for years, had never even realized he was black. In the movie, Bo was played by the dark-skinned Delroy Lindo. Obviously, those pages of dialogue were removed from the script.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson</a>, of African and Samoan heritage.
<ul><li> He's been on the covers of <em>Jet</em> and <em>Ebony</em> magazines, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley">Mick Foley</a> described him as black in his autobiography <em>Have a Nice Day!</em> (specifically to make fun of Margaret Carlson for describing The Rock as a "white skinhead hateful wrestling guy").
</li><li> The Rock is popularly thought to be "raceless," even though he doesn't downplay his ethnicity outside of his roles. Some roles have even featured him as "baseline" white characters (such as on an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em>, where he played Superman/Clark Kent).
</li></ul></li><li> <em>"Sex Is..."</em> a documentary from 1993. 59 minutes in, Wayne Corbitt, a black man who is into white men, says, "I have rebelled against anybody telling me what I ought to be, and that includes the gay community, who doesn't really want you to be <strong>too black</strong>: 'Uh, don't get so Black Specific with those issues.' And the black community, which goes, 'Huh! SM? A black man who LIKES getting whipped?! Do you know blah blah blah lynchings in the 20s and blah blah blah.' Yeah, I do know that did happen. I didn't do it. I'm not a part of that. This is 1992 in San Francisco."
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EvesBayou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EvesBayou">Eve's Bayou</a></em>, which was specifically about black Creoles, who were of mixed ancestry and often formed their own communities.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StreetFighterTheLegendOfChunLi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StreetFighterTheLegendOfChunLi">Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li</a></em> has Chun Li played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristinKreuk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristinKreuk">Kristin Kreuk</a>, who's got Chinese heritage but looks decidedly mixed. And it really stands out when all the child actresses who play her in the prologue are <em>decidedly</em> Chinese.
</li><li> Kristen Kreuk also played an Indian Muslim woman in <em>Partition</em>, looking very out of place alongside British Irish/Indian actor Jimmy Mistry playing an Indian Sikh.
</li><li> The documentary <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXG38QxXY-s">Dark Girls<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> is about this trope, dissecting its implications and how it creates prejudice within the black community. In a strange twist, one (rather dark skinned) interviewee said that black men found her attractive and exotic, but refused to actually date her because she was too dark for them to be seen with in public. Be warned: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieMurphy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieMurphy">Eddie Murphy</a>'s love interests tend to be light-skinned African Americans.
</li><li> The 2013 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlingRing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlingRing">The Bling Ring</a></em> is based on a group of thieves who targeted celebrities. Rebecca Lee, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of real-life ringleader Rachel Lee, is played by Katie Chang, who is one-fourth Asian. For reference, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.imdb.com/media/rm3220876800/nm4583512">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is what Katie Chang looks like and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/bling-ring-leader-rachel-lee-faces-years-prison-celebrity-home-burglaries-article-1.957506">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is what Rachel Lee looks like.
</li><li> <em>The Wedding</em>, a TV movie about a wealthy light-skinned Black family on Martha's Vineyard, played this trope straight and subverted it all over the place. Halle Berry plays the lead Shelby, who faces a great deal of judgement from her family and friends for marrying a white man. Her sister, Liz, is married to a very dark-skinned man which has caused some pretty severe intra-family strife, especially with their white great-grandmother, since they pride themselves on being fair-skinned. There's also a flashback where Shelby and Liz's mother, Corinne, is implied to have aborted her third child since she didn't want to risk having a baby who looked like her (dark-skinned) father (her mother was white.)
</li><li> This trope plagued the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifetimeMovieOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifetimeMovieOfTheWeek">Lifetime Movie of the Week</a> "Aaliyah: Princess of R&amp;B" (a biographical feature on late R&amp;B singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aaliyah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aaliyah">Aaliyah</a>). Originally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Zendaya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Zendaya">Zendaya</a> was cast in the title role only for online criticism of the casting (particularly with Coleman bordering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown">Ambiguously Brown</a>) led to Coleman dropping out and the movie being placed on hold. Eventually, the producers cast Alexandra Shipp, who is still a fairly light-skinned actress but actually looks more like Aaliyah.
</li><li> The announcement of Alexandra Shipp as the teenaged Storm in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenApocalypse">X-Men: Apocalypse</a></em> has been met with many fans decrying the casting of Shipp as not being "black enough." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HalleBerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HalleBerry">Halle Berry</a> is also frequently called out with this for the previous films (Berry and Shipp both had black fathers and white mothers). It should be noted that Storm in the comics has been drawn with a mixture of white, African and Asian features - with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> saying it was to portray her as "a woman of the world", resembling Gaia. Storm's full background however does have two parents who were definitely African.
</li><li> Retired porn star Heather Hunter claimed that earlier in her career she was pressured to do scenes only with white performers. Although <em>most</em> of her partners were white (and mainly females), she arguably never fully obliged. On the other hand she didn't start having black co-stars until her last couple years in the industry, so there might have been some hesitation. To her credit she did bring in more black performers into the industry and was the first black major contract girl.
</li><li> The casting of Shana in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JemAndTheHolograms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JemAndTheHolograms">Jem and the Holograms</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionAdaptation">Live-Action Adaptation</a> came under fire for casting Aurora Perrineau, a biracial actress with straight hair. Shana is fairly dark skinned and has a tightly-coiled afro in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem">the cartoon</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Nina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Nina">Nina</a></em> caused controversy when mixed-race actress Zoe Saldana was cast as African-American musician Nina Simone. Saldana's skin is darkened and she wears a prosthetic nose to better look the part.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSapphires" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSapphires">The Sapphires</a></em>, the story of an Aboriginal girls quartet that toured Vietnam entertaining the troops, one of the group members, Kay, is a member of the stolen generation, and her time spent in Melbourne passing as a white girl (after being taken away by an agency and put into a mission as a child) is a source of tension between her and Gail, the darkest member of the group who deals with whatever insecurities she has about her complexion by almost relentlessly bullying Kay. And rather than lording her light complexion over the others, Kay has her own insecurities about it (probably due to Gail's ill treatment)—in the course of developing a relationship with a black GI, she feels it necessary to point out that even though she's "pale black", she's still black.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHungerGames">The Hunger Games</a></em> drew controversy with the casting of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferLawrence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferLawrence">Jennifer Lawrence</a> as Katniss. She's described as olive-skinned and dark-haired in the books - and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that everyone in the universe is mixed race to some degree. While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbilityOverAppearance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbilityOverAppearance">Ability over Appearance</a> comes into play, the main source of controversy was that the casting was restricted to white actresses only. This is especially ironic, as some fans erupted with controversy over Rue being played by a black actress, despite her being described as brown-skinned in the book.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZoeKravitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZoeKravitz">Zoë Kravitz</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/zoe-kravitz-dark-knight-rises-809141">claims<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that she was denied an audition for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises">The Dark Knight Rises</a></em> - with the reasoning being "we're not going urban". Fans assume she was going after the small role of Selina's friend Jen - who ended up played by the very white Juno Temple.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SoulFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SoulFood">Soul Food</a></em>. Maxine accuses her son Ahmad of being "color struck" when she notices that out of the two girls who have come to visit him, he completely ignores the dark-skinned girl in favor of the light-skinned one, even though he has more in common with the darker girl.
</li><li> Oscar Micheaux is considered a pioneer film director, especially when it comes to black Americans directing films. Many of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceFilm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceFilm">race films</a> were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">Author Tracts</a>. He usually had mixed-race or light skinned black people as the leads while darker skinned people were lower-class supporting roles or villains.
</li><li> The stylist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok">Thor: Ragnarok</a></em> claims that they considered giving Valkyrie blonde hair, as in the comics. But out of respect of this trope, they left <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TessaThompson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TessaThompson">Tessa Thompson</a>'s hair black as opposed to making her a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSkinnedBlond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSkinnedBlond">Dark-Skinned Blond</a>.

</li><li> Some critics have noted that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RobinsonCrusoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RobinsonCrusoe">Robinson Crusoe</a></em> describes Friday, a Carib Indian from South America, as remarkably European in appearance: small nose, thin lips, a brighter skin tone than "other natives of America," and generally "all the sweetness and softness of a European in his countenance."

Mrs. Turner admires her for those white traits and even tries to set her up with her lighter-skinned son because she doesn't like her Not Too Black idol being married to a very dark-skinned man. Halle Berry quite appropriately plays Janie in the movie version of the novel.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBluestEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBluestEye">The Bluest Eye</a></em> is a novel that examines the relationship between beauty and race. The protagonist is a dark-skinned black girl who notices how light-skinned black girls are given more respect than she. Eventually she gets it into her head that if she only had blue eyes then people would stop treating her so horribly.
</li><li> In one novel by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndrewVachss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndrewVachss">Andrew Vachss</a> a black character explains "the paper bag trick" to his white friend. Paraphrased: "I know lots of black guys who do the paper bag trick— they hold a brown paper bag up next to their face in the mirror; if their skin is darker than the bag they're going nowhere in life. Nowadays black mothers want their daughters to marry lighter."

She takes advantage of this early on in her escape. Her husband is mulatto, and with a little makeup was able to pass as Hispanic while on the run. The 1927 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook">film adaptation</a> took this to the extreme by casting white actors for both parts.
</li><li> In Aphra Behn's <em>Oroonoko</em>, the titular character, an African prince, is explicitly described as having European facial features and having "a perfect ebony" complexion as opposed to "that brown rusty black which most of that nation are" and the description she gives makes him seem less like a real person and more like a statue carved out of black stone. The fits with the overall theme of the novel, which does not condemn slavery so much as say that Oroonoko should not be a slave because he is royalty and different than the other citizens of his country, who are fair game.
</li><li> The first edition of Octavia Butler's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LilithsBrood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LilithsBrood">Dawn</a></em> had the main character portrayed as a white woman when she was really black.

</li><li> This trope was just one of the many, <em>many</em> reasons that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SaveThePearls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SaveThePearls">Save the Pearls</a>: Revealing Eden</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">fell down flat on its face with its message about the pains of racism</a>. So it's far in the future, blacks are on top culturally, whites are on the bottom, and as a result, the standards of beauty lean black... and yet when white girls "pass" as black (using, yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackface" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackface">exactly the means you think they do</a>), they've still got some pretty damn straight hair. Videos made to promote the book show Eden applying the black make-up to her skin but she does nothing to alter her hair - and this is supposed to be a future where white features are considered ugly.
</li><li> The cover art version also comes up on the covers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRunelords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRunelords">The Runelords</a></em> novels. Princess Iome is specifically noted in the books as being a result of a mixed-race political marriage between her white father and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Fantasy Counterpart Culture</a> Middle Eastern/Indian mother (it's a bit ambiguous, as the region her mother came from covers a wide-enough range to fairly match that of "from the Middle East to India" and is internally very diverse; given political marriages, being Raj Ahten's cousin is no indicator). After her own political marriage, a common woman in her husband's homeland is shown wondering if pale complexions will become unfashionable now that the darker-complexioned (and very popular) Iome is to be their new queen. On the covers she looks like a white woman who never goes outside.
</li><li> Nicole from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BeautyQueens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BeautyQueens">Beauty Queens</a></em> is quite black. She states how difficult it is for her to manage her hair. However, her mother bought her skin bleaching cream to make her appear more white.

So of course he must be described as "very light-coloured for a Zulu".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AroundTheWorldInEightyDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AroundTheWorldInEightyDays">Around the World in 80 Days</a></em>, published in 1872, features protagonist Phileas Fogg falling in love with Aouda, an Indian princess that he meets on his travels. Verne makes his mixed marriage easier to swallow for 19th century readers by describing Aouda as having "skin as white as a European's" and expressing herself "in perfect English".
</li><li> In the original illustrations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TwentyThousandLeaguesUnderTheSea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TwentyThousandLeaguesUnderTheSea">20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</a></em>, Captain Nemo doesn't look remotely Indian. This is for two reasons: his nationality wasn't revealed until the sequel, and he was originally planned to be a Polish noble fighting against the oppressive Russians. France being allied with Russia at the time, Verne's editor convinced him to use a more traditional (to the French) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets">Acceptable Target</a>, and Nemo became an Indian fighting the British.

Period-appropriate racism is expressed by various characters in the book.
</li><li> <em>Outliers: The Story of Success</em> is a book by Malcolm Gladwell that looks into how systems and cultures can accidentally create bias where none might otherwise exist, predisposing some people to succeed and others to fail. The most dramatic example is in the Canadian Youth Hockey League (in Canada, hockey is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> and begins at an early age), where the majority of players are born in the early months of the year. This is because each league is age based and the cut-off date is January 1st. Children born earlier in the year are older, larger, and better coordinated than children born later in the year and as they progress, continual sifting and selection gives them better coaching and more practice such that by the time they're 17, when the accident of birth no longer matters in terms of native talent, the cumulative effect of all that extra work has made them into elite players. The theme of accidental success is personal for Gladwell. Generations earlier, one of his African ancestors was purchased to be a concubine in Jamaica, thus granting all her descendants extra whiteness. Jamaican racism, as described by Gladwell, differentiates with acuity based on the skin color, and he credits much of his own success to the easier successes of each generation of his family. His mother grew up relatively affluent, which allowed her to get a better education, eventually studying in London before moving to Canada.

Some black celebrities took offense to this, with one even citing the "one-drop" rule (that being, if you have one drop of black blood, you're black). It was noted on a follow-up episode discussing the issue and how it related to race in America that <em>this was a rule invented by slavers to expand their potential "product base"</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted</a> in the Gatorade Focus commercials, in which the animators seem to have assiduously eradicated any trace of non-black features on the animated Tiger.

She was both too Asian and not Asian enough. Much of Cho's comedy stems from the fact that she has "Classic" Asian looks, but has a very American Gen X attitude.

An early episode reveals that she was very culturally White growing up (justified since she was adopted by a white family), and her interest in exploring black culture is very recent. This is later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">revisited</a> in Season 2 when her white adopted sister Tanya, who <em>thinks</em> she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyFlyForAWhiteGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyFlyForAWhiteGuy">pretty fly for a white girl</a>, takes her act a bit too far and ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NWordPrivileges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NWordPrivileges">saying the N-word</a> in a salon full of black customers (including other main girlfriend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SassyBlackWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SassyBlackWoman">Maya</a>, who had up until that point been the only girlfriend who didn't mind Tanya's antics), leading to this confrontation:
<dl><dd><div class="indent"> <strong>Tanya</strong>: Ain't this a trip? Suddenly <em>you're</em> the authority on what's "black?" Two years ago, you were a biracial grunge girl, and before that, you were just some pretty white girl!

<ul><li> Kendra has been accused of this by some fans, as her actress Bianca Lawson is lighter skinned and the character is from rural Jamaica. This is however a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">Reality Is Unrealistic</a> - as Jamaica is quite the melting pot of ethnicities, Kendra having lighter skin is plausible. Her actress Bianca Lawson usually wears her hair straight but it's worn with a bit of an unkempt curl - presumably so Kendra would look believably like someone who was isolated from the latest beauty treatments.
</li><li> Giles's girlfriend Olivia appears in Season 4. She's an aversion as, despite being Giles's love interest (he's white), she's very dark skinned.
</li><li> A huge aversion is the First Slayer Sineya, the root of the Slayer line and the very first to be given the power. Not only is she shown to be a powerful combatant, she is quite clearly a very dark-skinned African girl.

One episode focuses on her and her white wife at a group therapy session being accosted by a radical black lesbian poet. The latter accused her of embracing her lesbian lifestyle but ignoring her own blackness. Previously, she requested her wife accept a black donor's sperm for their child so s/he could racially reflect both parents, so she argued the poet down, but was very hurt.

</li><li> One HBO special, <em>George Clinton's Cosmic Slop</em>, was a set of several 'Twilight Zone' short episodes. In one episode, aliens land in the United States, and offer to solve all their economic and energy problems.

It's established early on that she has two gay dads: one black, one white. Both men donated sperm and mixed it up so that they wouldn't know who directly sired her. The show cast the very fair-skinned Brian Stokes Mitchell as the black dad because a man with skin too dark is obviously not going to be her biological father.

The character was originally supposed to be a white Jewish Princess. Lark Voorhies got the role based on the strength of her audition, despite the fact casting specifically asked for only white females.
</li><li> The show drew some criticism for ignoring Slater's ethnicity during its run. The character was written to be white but when they couldn't find the right actor - they extended casting calls to actors of colour, and the Hispanic Mario Lopez won the part. An episode of <em>The College Years</em> reveals that Slater's father changed his last name from the more obviously Latin 'Sanchez' when he joined the army.

The segment was called "Black Folk With White Features" and was hosted by Stern dressed in Malcolm X gear, giving his name as 'Howard Washington Stern' and claiming that he and Robin Quivers were brother and sister, the idea being that he was a light-skinned black man instead of white.

Her Grams also appears to be very light skinned as well as her mother Abby so this could be a genetic thing or it could be a possibility that Sheila was biracial and had a white parent although this has not been proven or confirmed. The reason for Bonnie being light skinned and appearing rather white in terms of her physical features is because Bonnie's portrayer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatGraham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatGraham">Kat Graham</a> is actually biracial and is half black, half white (her mother is White Jewish of Polish and Russian descent and her father is Black of Liberian descent).

<ul><li> It's worth noting the Sheila "Grams" Bennett, Bonnie's grandmother, is portrayed by Jasmine Guy, who is maternally of half Caucasian (specifically Portuguese) descent.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Covered on the old Donahue daytime talk show - talking to lightskin blacks who tried to pass as biracial or white when in reality they were just black usually born of two light-complexioned parents. Some changed their stance when they got older; needless to say some of their relatives weren't too pleased with their black acceptance.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TyraBanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TyraBanks">Tyra Banks</a> had a few episodes about this subject on her talk show, with one mixed black man (who was not terribly light-skinned himself) saying that he thought all dark-skinned men looked like cockroaches.

Karl said that there is no racism in fashion. Noemie said the contrary. Then Karl said she's the proof there's no racism because she's famous.

Penelope's daughter, Elena, talks of how she's been lucky to have never been subjected to this. It takes seeing the reactions of her mother and grandmother to realize the reason is that she can "pass" for a white person (her mom even compares her to a young Anne Hathaway). A proud activist, Elena is actually upset folks see her this way.
<div class="indent"><strong>Elena</strong>: You're saying I can go through my whole life without being oppressed at all?

For reasons unknown, Sherwood was soon replaced with Khalil again. The notable difference in the actresses skin tones—Khalil is of Caucasian, Native American, African-American, and Pakistani heritage and thus considerably lighter than Sherwood—resulted in many viewers feeling that TPTB were displaying this.

</li><li> Perri "Pebbles" Reid has also had album covers depicting her a lot lighter then what she actually was. This is especially jarring considering she was already fairly light complexioned.
</li><li> Alternative hip-hop group The Jungle Brothers covers this trope in a song called "Black Is Black".

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a>'s albums became a subversion of this starting with the <em>Dangerous</em> CD due to his music becoming more urban and less Pop/Rock oriented. Well <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">in some fans opinion anyway</a>, particularly the ones who preferred the more R&amp;B disco <em>Off The Wall</em> Album to his <em>Thriller</em>, and <em>Bad</em> album.
<ul><li> Notoriously, Jackson's actual appearance seemed to be playing this trope straight. His gradually paling skin from the mid-1980s onwards was the subject of much speculation that he was intentionally bleaching it, even though he was already hugely successful and didn't have to worry about this trope. He explained in a 1993 interview that he had the skin disorder vitiligo, which destroyed his skin pigmentation. Still, combined with his plastic surgeries, jokes may always be made about how he resembled a white woman (at best) in his later years: i.e. "Only in America can a poor black boy grow up to be a rich white woman." (You can do anything... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries">IN AMERICA!</a>)

</li><li> Teena Marie is an inversion as she was initially "But Not Too WHITE," so due to Executive Meddling her debut album didn't show her picture or let her appear in public.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CabCalloway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CabCalloway">Cab Calloway</a> may have been one of the first people this trope was applied to. His lighter skin made him easier to accept for whites at the time (this being the 1930's, back when performing in blackface was still okay). He also came from a middle-class background — quite rare for blacks at the time — and so was able to transcend the "ghetto" and "sharecropper" stereotypes applied to poorer blacks.
</li><li> Jelly Roll Morton was known to brag about his fair appearance and White ancestry and mocked other African-Americans for looking blacker than him. When interviewed about his past, he would emphasize his Cajun ancestors and gloss over his African ones.

<ul><li> She not only has very light skin but has dyed her hair progressively lighter colors over the years (so that it's basically blonde now).
</li><li> This is highlighted in the music video for "Beautiful Liar" where Beyonce duets with Shakira. Throughout the duration of the video, it is often difficult to identify which singer is which. Seriously. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrOe2h9RtWI">Check out the video on YouTube here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, you might start to doubt your powers of facial recognition.

</li><li> Beyonce's skin has ranged for brown to light, depending on lighting/makeup/tanning. Naturally, she's "damn near white." That Beyoncé is also rumored to bleach her skin in real life only adds to the confusion.

However, they achieved only moderate success in their day, and singer Phil Lynott has been described as "too black for America". Keep in mind: whether or not this was the case, if the record label believed so, then they were not going to be receiving adequate promotion. And it could fairly be said that they <em>did not</em> receive adequate label support; they remained semi-obscure despite a series of consistent albums, and a sound that went on to influence later hugely-successful acts such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DefLeppard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DefLeppard">Def Leppard</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronMaiden">Iron Maiden</a>.

Despite that, she kept the plastic surgery coming, and now people have made some harsh jokes that now she looks closer to <a class="urllink" href="http://dlisted.com/2013/02/03/open-post-hosted-lil-kims-face">"an Asian LaToya Jackson."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Some rappers have come under fire for praising light skinned black women while trashing dark skinned women. Rapper Yung Berg, who is barely fair skinned, made a statement on XFM radio that he doesn't like dark skinned women, going on calling them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">"dark butts"</a>. He then states in order for him to date a woman, they must pass a pool test. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">The pool test is if a woman jumps in the pool and doesn't look better than she did before jumping in, meaning her hair is nappy, then it's "not a good look"</a>. The day after he made an apology and stated that his mother is dark skinned.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LilWayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LilWayne">Lil Wayne</a> made a similar comment when he <a class="urllink" href="http://bossip.com/327464/does-lil-wayne-really-have-beef-with-brown-skinned-women12006/">encountered a dark-skinned black female fan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. After another rapper, Gudda Gudda, commented that she was attractive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackhandedCompliment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackhandedCompliment">for a dark girl</a>, Wayne agreed by quoting a lyric from his song "Right Above" (<em>Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better <a class="urllink" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=redbone">red<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>). The fan asked him how he could say something so disparaging when his oldest daughter shares his own brown skin tone, he allegedly replied "my daughter is a dark skinned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney">millionaire</a>. Thats the difference between her and you."

</li><li> During the 70s and 80s, light-skinned black male artist were the most popular and presented to the public media in America, mainly because they had crossover appeal and were popular with both black and white females. Groups like Debarge and singers like Al-Be-Sure and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LionelRichie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LionelRichie">Lionel Richie</a> were the face of R&amp;B music. Rappers like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LLCoolJ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LLCoolJ">LL Cool J</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WillSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WillSmith">Will Smith</a> were the face of rap music. This changed during the 90s after gangster rap became popular for showing mostly dark-skinned black men in a strong, masculine, light regardless of the many negative factors of the music itself. It would help put dark-skinned black men on an equal playing field with light-skinned black men in the rap industry.
<ul><li> Yet which rapper in the 90s stirred up the most controversy with his song "Cop Killer"? The very light skinned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IceT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IceT">Ice-T</a>.
<ul><li> Although, it should be noted that the song was actually released by Ice-T's hardcore punk/metal side project <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BodyCount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BodyCount">Body Count</a>, which is part of two genres that are generally known for being predominately white.
</li></ul></li><li> Also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JamesBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JamesBrown">James Brown</a>, Otis Redding and Wilson Pickett were the face of R&amp;B in the 60s. Musical content <strong>does</strong> contribute a great deal to popularity.

</li><li> Afrobeat musician <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FelaKuti" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FelaKuti">Fela Kuti</a> tackled this topic in his 1976 song "Yellow Fever". It was a common view in Africa that lighter skin was more beautiful, and many women became physically ill from using unsafe skin-lightening creams. Fela criticized that view as a holdover from colonialism, and pointed out that those lightening creams just made you look sick anyway.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a> was largely considered this, and was basically a 50's version of Eminem.

</li><li> Primitive Man addressed this on "Disfigured" (as frontman Ethan McCarthy is a very light-skinned mixed-race black man): if you're light-skinned enough and lack any obviously black features, you will enjoy white privilege, but at the cost of being an alien; you will be accepted by white people without really being one of them, and you will feel like a traitor to black people despite being the descendant of slaves because of that same white privilege that you enjoy solely because of a lucky spin on the genetic roulette.

<ul><li> Hip-hop stars have come under fire for having predominantly light-skinned black women or other oiled up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown">ethnically vague</a> women of color (biracial, multiracial etc.), including Latina or even only white women in their videos. It could be argued that it's the casting director's fault, and not the fault of the artists themselves. This is also likely due to the fact that modeling agencies tend to favor ethnic women of a lighter shade, so they're more likely to be cast by default.
</li><li> Hip Hop videos tend to cast dark-skinned models in large groups as the background eye candy but any video focusing on a single girl playing the singer's main squeeze will almost invariably be played by a model of caramel skin or lighter.

Also became more obvious when Carly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfroAsskicker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfroAsskicker">grew a huge afro</a>) Despite this though, you'll occasionally hear/read comments like "not black, Puerto Rican" in regards to members of WWC and IWA PR's rosters, as if the two are mutually exclusive.
</li><li> In what could have been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> to this trope, in 2003 the very dark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TeddyLong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TeddyLong">Teddy Long</a> developed the gimmick of an oppressed black man and starting a stable with black wrestlers and having them squash white jobbers in what he dubbed the "White Boy Challenge". The kicker? Most of the wrestlers he recruited were very light skinned such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DLoBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DLoBrown">D'Lo Brown</a> and Rodney Mack. However he did also recruit the very dark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CarleneMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CarleneMoore">Jazz</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MarkHenry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MarkHenry">Mark Henry</a>.

The Rock, being well aware of and uncomfortable with some of the implications, had his character make both the heel turn and joining the Nation be more about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XPacHeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XPacHeat">fan disrespect</a> than about color. This trope in relation to Dwayne Johnson was parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>, when the voiceover for the trailer to a movie starring him and Stewie shows confusion over what his ethnicity actually is.

And although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SashaBanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SashaBanks">Sasha Banks</a> (who is mixed black and Hispanic) eventually netted a push, it took her <em>two years</em> to finally get one - in contrast to other Divas who got them rather quickly. Likewise any Latina Divas who are lighter skinned, have historically downplayed their ethnic backgrounds in favour of being either Anglo or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown">Ambiguously Brown</a>. Things became even more questionable after the article was published when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SashaBanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SashaBanks">Sasha Banks</a> did become Women's Champion - only to drop the title twice back to Charlotte after short-lived reigns. Things got worse when her feud with Charlotte ended, and she won the title from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AlexaBliss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AlexaBliss">Alexa Bliss</a>...only to drop it back almost immediately afterwards.
</li><li> In addition to the points outlined in the article above <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Layla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Layla">Layla</a> always wore her curly hair straight as soon as she started getting proper pushes. Her first title win was a co-champions deal with the white <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MichelleMcCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MichelleMcCool">Michelle McCool</a>, and her second saw her getting barely featured. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AliciaFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AliciaFox">Alicia Fox</a> likewise held the Divas' title around the same time, also coincidentally switching her afro hairstyle out for a more Anglo set of curls. There were a few WWE.com photo shoots that appeared to have lightened her skin in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a> as well.
</li><li> Greek Divas <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus">Trish Stratus</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MariaKanellis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MariaKanellis">Maria Kanellis</a> notably downplayed their roots while in WWE. Trish's real name is Stratigeas and she's naturally brunette - but her modelling days saw her going for the more neutral name Stratus, bleaching her hair blonde and adopting a bronze tan. Notably once Trish achieved some prominence in the women's division, the bronze tan was lessened, and her Greek heritage was acknowledged in a promotional DVD. Maria too had blonde hair early in her career and later became redhead. She never used her last name during her first WWE run, but is now using it (with real-life husband Mike Bennett taking his wife's surname in storyline) as of her 2017 return.
</li><li> WWE's Arab performer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Aliyah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Aliyah">Aliyah</a> initially looked as if she were going to play up her heritage - with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BellyDancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BellyDancer">Belly Dancer</a> inspired gimmick. She ended up dropping the gimmick after only two appearances, and her heritage has not been referenced on screen yet. While her ring name 'Aliyah' is Arabic in origin, it's associated with the black R&amp;B singer and has been used in Latina and Jewish circles too - making her come across as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown">Ambiguously Brown</a> (she's even been mistaken for a tanned white girl). In 2018 she was even accused of having cosmetic surgery to look less ethnic.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EveTorres" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EveTorres">Eve Torres</a> suspiciously had her last name dropped around the time she got pushed for the title, and her Latina background was never acknowledged on TV.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Naomi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Naomi">Naomi</a> was suspiciously kept out of the title picture for years despite her popularity with fans and catching onto wrestling very quickly. She had the poor luck in 2014 to get an eye injury while in the middle of a title push - and she was shunted aside in favour of calling up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Paige" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Paige">Paige</a> from NXT (and it quickly became clear the writers had no idea what to do with Paige either). Next year Naomi got her push - by being turned heel in a move that nobody (including the lady herself) thought was a good idea. It was finally averted in 2016 where she was turned back face and pushed as the top woman of the Smackdown women's division. She held the Smackdown Women's Championship twice. She later revealed that she experienced colorism when she was first signed; in FCW, she performed with her natural hair in braids but had to put in a straight weave when she was called up to TV. She didn't wrestle with her natural hair until 2020, and admitted that she was terrified to finally do so.

<ul><li> Ice hockey goaltender Grant Fuhr played 19 seasons in the NHL, helped the Edmonton Oilers win five Stanley Cups, and was regarded by no less than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WayneGretzky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WayneGretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a> as the greatest goalie in hockey history. Only when be was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame did many fans realize that Fuhr is black, and notably, the first black inducted to the HHoF. Being raised in Alberta by white Canadians and spending his entire career in the older-style goalie mask may have had something to do with that.

<ul><li> The first black <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Barbie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Barbie">Barbie</a></em> dolls had the right skin tone, but were processed from the same mold used to make white Barbies; thus they had African-American skin but white features. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Barbie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Barbie">Barbie</a></em> So In Style line attempts to avert this, with mixed results. The dolls do have green/blue eyes and straight hair, but there was an effort to include many different types of skintones and they have distinct African facial features.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGirlsCollection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGirlsCollection">American Girl</a></em> dolls have a similar problem to Barbies, but with hair.

Sometimes she'll be the same tone as she was in the movie, but a lot of merchandise features her with much lighter skin. In at least one of the children's books, she was almost as light as the white princesses! The Japanese official art is even worse at lightning her skin than the American ones. A similar non-black example occurred with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Mulan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Mulan">Mulan</a> in the 2013 relaunch of the Disney Princess franchise, which included more "stylized", "fashionable" redesigns for the characters.

<ul><li> This is a common problem in many games with a "Create A Character" mode. In many cases, the option to play a really dark-skinned character doesn't even exist. This is especially jarring in games which allow you to play a "Dark <em>Elf</em>" which is black in the most literal sense, but do not allow you to make a dark-skinned <em>human.</em> Sometimes, even when there are options to darken the skin, there are still no facial features or hairstyles to match. So what's left is either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown">Ambiguously Brown</a> or the "white person in blackface" effect.

Confusingly, Minecraft's official <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMerch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMerch">promotional merchandise</a> tends to portray him <a class="urllink" href="http://archive.is/Iytwd">a fair bit lighter than he appears in-game<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, to the point that he could be a Caucasian with a tan.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries">Soul Calibur III</a></em>, the first appearance of a black character in the canon (Zasalamel), and the series' first create-a-fighter mode, doesn't translate into a black skin option, as the darker you try to go, the more the saturation drops. So even though there's at least one face option that has somewhat African features, trying to pick a naturally darker skin color to match it just makes your character <em>gray</em>.
<ul><li> Additionally, while Zasalamel is from an undetermined homeland, most clues put his origin as being in what is now <em>Iraq</em>, and his home stage is in <em>Poland</em>. As of the first six games in the series, he is also the only human character not to hail from Western Europe or Eastern Asia.

Whenever you try to make a dark-skinned Redguard, they turn out with ugly green splotches that should NOT be there. Makes you wonder if the people at Bethesda have never seen a real dark-skinned black person before. The fact that Redguards share a skin texture file with the other human races does not help.

She also lacks any African features and has blue eyes and straight white hair. Though in <em>3rd Strike</em> her official character art did get changed to a more realistic dark brown color.
</li><li> Laura from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV">Street Fighter V</a></em> is Afro-Brazilian and on the fair side, much lighter than her brother Sean from <em>Street Fighter III</em>.

If not for the photo he carries of his family (In which, for some reason, he's quite a bit darker) there'd be no way to tell if he was actually black. It came across like the studio got cold feet when making the character. Made worse in the sequel, where they lightened him up to look like a tanned white man.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ZeroPunctuation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ZeroPunctuation">Yahtzee</a> described her as looking like "a white woman who's been dipped in tea." She also doesn't sound very African, using some sort of meandering British/Australian accent. She was motion captured and modeled after an Australian actress <a class="urllink" href="http://www.michellevanderwater.com/">Michelle Jade Van Der Water<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who is on the lighter side...though it does cater to the trope in that every other African is darker in the game and she happens to have green eyes.
</li><li> There is also the controversy after rumors that Sheva was only made black at all to combat the accusations of racism the game was receiving for having dark-skinned African villagers as the "monsters" of the game, so some people saw Sheva's light color as being an insufficient compromise and example of this trope (dark skinned Africans = crazy diseased zombies, light skinned African = female lead.
</li><li> Sheva has always been a character in the development of the game, but her role changed after the allegations. However, Sheva's appearance is really jarring when compared to Josh, who averts the trope.

As a result, she's left off many lists of notable badass video game women of color. And the only way we know she's supposed to be half-Asian inside the game is a picture of her with both of her parents from before the Black Mesa Incident.

She and her father are both blond (with blond eyebrows) and with blue eyes. The comic adaptation adds to this, as the colour/lighting of the comic is essentially "white with very dark and bold colours as the shadows", which has the unfortunate effect of making her look white in a majority of pages. The only pages in which she looks like her game counterpart are her introductory page (in which the lighting is mostly red and brown) and a watercolour image of her a few pages later (that still manages to be paler than she is in-game).
</li><li> Naomi Hunter's ambiguous ethnicity is actually what led her to study genetics in the first place, as she wanted to find out about her roots. Although never definitively confirmed, in a Codec conversation she states that she believes her skin tone is from the Indian laborers from her native Zanzibar and even her Japanese bio describes Hunter as a "brown-skinned beauty". She didn't receive an in-game model until the <em>VR Missions</em>/<em>Integral</em>, yet she looks almost indistinguishable from a white woman there.

Not only did she looked too similar to the Caucasian Cassie Cage, Jacqui shared almost no physical similarities to her father, with only her cornrows arguably being the only thing Black about her. Come <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat11" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat11">Mortal Kombat 11</a></em>, Jacqui had a complete overhaul, looking much more like Jax (<em>including</em> skin tone), and having more diverse hairstyles that Black women actually wear.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:

The Japanese version had everyone light skinned, and the Western ones added tanned and black versions of all the various trainers. It was implemented a bit awkwardly, but it's there.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pokémon X and Y</a></em> unfortunately have this. While you have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualPaperDoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualPaperDoll">a good number of customization options for you character</a>, the darkest you can have your skin be is light brown. (<em>May</em> be justified, since the player's mother looks the same no matter what, implying it could be due to them being biracial.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a></em> added a dark brown skin tone option. In terms of hair options, the protagonist still only has straight hair (though the female protagonist can get a cornrow bun hairstyle), but this is most likely due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFlowInCGI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFlowInCGI">No Flow in CGI</a>. The game, which is set on a Hawaii counterpart, has NPCs of various skin tones.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>, there were many white, Asians, Hispanics, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown">Ambiguously Brown</a> characters, but no dark-skinned Africans until Jacob in the second game. Character creation is mixed on this. There <em>are</em> broad noses and full lips to select, but no appropriate hairstyles, at least for black men (unless you go for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldBlackLeaderGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldBlackLeaderGuy">Bald, Black Leader Guy</a>). The best attempts at creating a black male Shepard will still look off when standing next to Jacob, whose features are unique.

Interestingly enough, due to <em>DOA 5</em>'s more realistic aesthetic for the fighters, Lisa has a broader nose and fuller lips, making her actually look like a black woman instead of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mukokuseki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mukokuseki">generic anime babe painted brown.</a>
</li><li> Similarly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VirtuaFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VirtuaFighter">Virtua Fighter</a></em> has Vanessa, a dark skinned Vale Tudo fighter with long straight white hair. In her debut, her skin tone was very dark, even darker than the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan">Scary Black Man</a> Jeffry. Fans loved her, but a small minority found her to be something of Scary Black Woman thanks to Vanessa also being very buff and having a tough, tomboy attitude and gruff voice. In the next game after, Vanessa's skin tone was made much lighter, on top of losing muscle mass and her voice becoming more feminine. Thankfully, customization options in the last update allowed fans of her original look to make her skin dark again.
</li><li> An odd example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>: in the promotional materials for the game, Isabela had a far lighter skin tone than she actually has in-game. Unfortunately, this has persisted in comic covers and art books even after release. The character creation also makes it hard for you to create a person of East African descent. You can make their skin dark brown, but there are no facial features or hair to complete the package.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken">Tekken</a></em>:

Her grandfather also appears to be Asian - though it's not confirmed if she's adopted.
</li></ul></li><li> Clementine from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a>, to the point where she can be confused with every other ethnicity. A persistent rumor used to be that she's asian, due to her being based on the daughter of the storyboard artist, Derek Sakai. Some people, especially in her season 3 version, thought she was hispanic. Her skin is quite light and she lacks any traditionally black facial features. Her voice actress, Melissa Hutchison, is white. The official statement on her ethnicity is that she's african-american, but it's possible she has distant ancestors of different races.

</li><li> There's been debates with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em> fans about how Susie is colored in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllGrownUp">All Grown Up!</a></em>. Her skin and general coloring is lighter in season 1 but became even lighter in season 2. At least part of it is blamed on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a>, as creators became more lighter in season 2.
</li><li> This common criticism of Orange Blossom in the 2009 incarnation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StrawberryShortcake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StrawberryShortcake">Strawberry Shortcake</a></em>. Due to her hair being straight and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces">Only Six Faces</a> being in action, she comes off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown">Ambiguously Brown</a> instead of the very unambiguously black she normally is. The 2018 reboot reversed this and made her more like her past designs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em>: Gerald, along with his mother, father and older brother all are fairly dark-skinned. His younger sister Timberly, is considerably light-skinned.
