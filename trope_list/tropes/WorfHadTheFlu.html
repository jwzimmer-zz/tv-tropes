</div></div><p>This is the specific rationalization that a character suffering from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> did so only because something (artificially) undermined their performance. The insinuation, of course, is that it probably wouldn't have happened this way under "normal" circumstances.

As the 'flu' is generally pulled from something within the story, explicit or otherwise, it does not necessarily require a blatant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">Canon Discontinuity</a> — the event <em>itself</em> is still treated as canonical.

</p><p>Whether or not a later matchup is provided becomes irrelevant. If enough ire is raised from using the Worf Effect, a later matchup may be specifically <em>avoided</em> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">dodge any mention of it at all</a>. On the other extreme, the response to the trope may be too loaded with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> overtones not to come off as petty. In contrast, a well-written <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvasiveFightThreadEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvasiveFightThreadEpisode">Evasive Fight-Thread Episode</a> often includes 'flu' logic in an effort to quell any complaints about the match-up.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Despite being a captain, Ukitake was unable to save Kaien because he had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncurableCoughOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncurableCoughOfDeath">coughing fit</a> in the middle of the fight. He was forced to order Rukia to kill Kaien to save everyone's lives, as he was incapable of fighting any further.
</li><li> During the Arrancar Arc, Ichigo's spiritual power constantly fluctuates. At his best, he can defeat powerful Espada but at his worst, he can't even fight a sealed Yammy. The problem centres on his fear of his inner hollow and his inability to control it. He only masters this fear and therefore his resolve at the very end of the arc. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He is also being sabotaged by his own power; his "Shinigami" power is really his Quincy power which is secretly suppressing as much of his real Shinigami power as possible, making it that much harder for Ichigo to understand and master his abilities.</span>
</li><li> Captain and Lieutenant-class Shinigami wear a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter">Power Limiter</a> in the living world, which can tamp them down to 20% of their normal power. Anime <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a> will often take advantage of this fact to make Shinigami lose fights they should win. In two arcs, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a> has also contrived a reason to render Ichigo's power so unreliable as to make him more of a liability than a use. In the Bount Arc, he was even forced to relearn Bankai, while the Gotei Invasion arc kept him at a fluctuating, diminishing power level due to it being set at a time where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon">canon</a> had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToBadass">removed his power</a> completely.
</li><li> If a Bankai ever breaks, it's impossible to repair the Bankai back to its original form. It can only function at a reduced level ever after. Renji's Bankai was broken by Byakuya and Ikkaku's was broken by Edorad. It's also revealed that a refusal to properly embrace and become one with a Zanpakutou results in its power being held back from the Shinigami. Ikkaku is well-known for fighting his power instead of embracing it, but Renji's zanpakutou also doesn't trust him enough to share its full power willingly.
</li><li> Nnoitra Gilga benefits from this three times (though twice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">he set it up</a>). In the backstory, he was only able to injure <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nel</span> because he attacked her friends first and then used an illusion to set her up for a cheap shot. Against Ichigo, he ambushed him after he won a fight against Grimmjow and was exhausted, and he only won <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his fight against Nel</span> because her reiatsu was unstable because of the injury he dealt her a while back and she was unable to land the finishing blow.
</li><li> When Zaraki defeats <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Gremmy</a>, he's left in a very badly injured state and coughing up blood. He is immediately ambushed by four female Sternritters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">who reason</a> the best chance anyone stands of defeating Zaraki is to take him down when he's in such a bad state. They succeed.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>:
<ul><li> When Guts first encountered the Holy Iron Chain Knights, he was heavily injured and exhausted from his fight with Rosine, one of the most furious and grueling battles of his career. As such, he was weak enough for them to capture, though not without taking casualties. When he encounters them again, as he's searching for Casca, some of them remark that his combat performance was leagues above the first time.
</li><li> Casca actually loses and needs rescuing from her first battle with Adon Coborlwitz. While tending to her Guts notes blood between her thighs and comments to himself how it must be hard for a woman mercenary. The next time she and Adon meet, during the Battle of Doldrey, the beatdown goes the other way, and Adon does not survive.
<ul><li> It's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Gun</a>, as she's seen being 'out of it' earlier. Furthermore, as in case the viewer doesn't get it, Adon says, when being beat down: "YOU HAD PMS!?"
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>: Luffy and the rest of the Straw Hats are initially unable to defeat the CP9, and while they are not yet using the techniques they use to defeat their opponents in later battles, Nami suggests that they weren't fighting at their full potential because they were still unsure whether Robin had betrayed them. Once they realize that she did what she did for their sake, they are able to fight to their full power to rescue her (Strangely enough, Sanji knows Robin's reasons and still is unable to defeat Blueno, but later defeats the far more powerful Jyabura). Luffy also admits he wasn't at his fullest because he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">wasn't full</a> and just fought Wanze, who was a relatively weak enemy but managed to thrash Sanji a fair amount before he started using knives.
<ul><li> Earlier in the manga, Sanji was wounded by Pearl and nearly lost to Gin.
</li><li> In the Skypiea arc, Luffy, Zoro and Sanji are unable to fight well against Wiper because they have not adapted to Skypiea's higher elevation and thinner atmosphere. Luffy manages to get over this by the time he fights the White Berets, and throughout the rest of the arc, there is no suggestion that the characters are fighting at anything less than their full potential.
</li><li> The Straw Hats exhaust themselves fighting the first Pacifista on the Sabaody Archipelago, making them easy pickings for Sentoumaru, Kizaru, Kuma and <strong>another</strong> Pacifista.
</li><li> Kuma seems to be a fan of this trope, considering that he's beaten the Strawhats twice, and both times he confronted them right after they'd fought a major, exhausting battle.
</li><li> Luffy's somewhat underwhelming (Haki aside) showings during the Kuja and Marineford battles are at least partially attributed to having to deal with the Kizaru/Kuma/Sentoumaru/Pacifista gangstomp the day before in the previous case and nearly dying against Magellan and being kept running on sheer willpower and hormone doping in the latter case. Of course, a lot of it has to do with the fact that the major players are all Warlord of the Sea class, at least, but the Luffy at Marineford didn't seem to be operating at the same caliber as he did against the likes of Rob Lucci and Gecko Moria, and actually had to be doped <em>again</em> near the end of the battle.
</li><li> This was the primary reason Franky was struggling against Fukurou, despite having previously overpowered Blueno; As he was lacking in Cola, his attacks were decreased in effectiveness and power. Once he got his cola back...
</li><li> Seriously, many of Zoro's battles had him at some sort of disadvantage or not at his full potential. In the battle with Cabaji, he was already injured from Buggy's earlier attack. When fighting Hachi, he was still recovering from his wounds from his fight with Mihawk and had a fever on top of that. He had difficulty with Mr 1 since Mr 1's body can become steel, something Zoro couldn't cut at the time. During the Davy Jones game, he wasn't able to use his swords due to the rules. He only had two swords with him during the fight against Ryuuma. And against Oars, he was still getting used to his new sword Shuusui. With Kuma, he had taken damage from Ryuuma and Oars over the night. With the Flying Fish Riders and with the Pacifista, he was hampered down from his injuries from Thriller Bark, along with Luffy's pain that was transferred to him.
<ul><li> This trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">didn't stop Zoro</a> during the Fishman Island Arc. His opponent was Hody Jones, a <em>Great White Shark</em> fishman. For those who didn't know, fishmen become ten times stronger while underwater, but the same can't be said for humans. However, despite needing to take a breath before drowning, Zoro effortlessly defeated Hody with only a single slash while underwater.
</li><li> Violently defied during his fight with Cabaji, who was targeting his earlier wound from Buggy. Zoro, mindful of his goal to be the best swordsman alive, proceeded to cut open the wounds, making them much worse. Cabaji believed that to be giving him an out, as Zoro could use the injury as an excuse for a loss. Zoro refutes that, saying that if he lost to someone like Cabaji with such a "minor" injury, he may as well give up on his dream altogether. He then hands Cabaji his ass.
</li></ul></li><li> Whitebeard, the man considered the equal to Roger at his peak, went into the Marineford war suffering heavily from illness, old age and injury. While his raw power and toughness still impressed everyone, many people noted he was nowhere near the top of his game, causing him to tank attacks that he would have otherwise either blocked or evaded. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Taking all those attacks did eventually kill him.</span>
<ul><li> Though considering how much damage his rampage caused, it's made people wonder how powerful he was when he was in his prime - and how powerful Roger was when he was still alive.
</li></ul></li><li> This was the case with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Trafalgar Law. Before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> he was too weak to stand up to Vergo, and was absolutely terrified of him. After it, it seems the situation has not changed, with Vergo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curb-stomping him twice</a>. However, this was mainly due to having Law's heart. Once Smoker got Law his heart back, Law proceeded to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curb-stomp Vergo</a> in his most powerful form with <em>one slash</em>, cutting apart not only Vergo but also the entire laboratory they were fighting in as well</span>.
<ul><li> Happens to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Law <em>again</em> in the Dressrosa arc. By the time he fights Donquixote Doflamingo one-on-one, he had to fight both Doflamingo and Admiral Fujitora <em>at the same time</em>, then protect Caesar and the Straw Hats from Doflamingo. He was undoubtedly exhausted by that point, and it doesn't help that his devil fruit abilities are explicitly stated to rely on his stamina. As an end result, he suffers a very bad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> at Doflamingo's hands</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Smoker likewise, had become a Vice-Admiral after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, and had fought fairly evenly (in some cases had the upper hand) against Vergo, who's of the same rank. He eventually lost, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILetYouWin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILetYouWin">though that was because he was trying to get Law's heart back instead of outright beating him</a>. Later, he's confronted by a very pissed off, homicidal, nothing-to-lose, Doflamingo - while Smoker was, at best, at half-strength from fighting Vergo.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> During the Chunnin exam tournament, Jiraiya notices the chakra-blocking seal that Orochimaru had placed over Naruto's Kyubi-containing belly-button seal, and realizes it prevented Naruto from channeling properly. Once he removed it, Naruto was able to instantly master the water-walking technique he had been struggling with before. And it might also explain Naruto's rather lackluster performance against Kiba — Naruto previously never needed any distractions or significant pauses in a fight to create Shadow Clones. Naruto himself never seemed to notice his own difficulties either.
</li><li> This is the only reason why Orochimaru was able to beat Hiruzen Sarutobi, the Sandaime Hokage. Hiruzen was <em>way</em> past his prime by the time of their fight and even the simple use of the Kage Bushin technique ate away at his lifespan. Orochimaru even said that had this been just ten years before, even with the Edo Tensei Hokages, Hiruzen would have won then.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0gcif');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0gcif" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0gcif');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Hiruzen was nicknamed "The Professor" for his comprehensive knowledge of all of Konoha's jutsu, but when he was younger he was also known as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">The God of Shinobi</a>", a title originally belonging to <em>the Sage of the Six Paths</em>.</span> But...since Hiruzen was in old age, the best he could do was a tie with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Taking You with Me</a> jutsu against Orochimaru and the Edo Hokages.
</li><li> Tsunade's first appearance has her using then-current <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Orochimaru like a paddleball. The only reason Orochimaru did not bust out far more powerful moves for the fight was because had previously lost the use of his arms (and thus, most of his jutsus). Jiraiya was likewise disabled thanks to a drug Tsunade slipped into one of his drinks earlier on. Tsunade as well suffered some early damage due to her entirely psychological weakness to blood, making her use her trump card on a healing power and, less memorably, as years out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass">practice</a>. If the Sannin were at their top form during the fight the others there would've been useless and the battle would've dwarfed even the epic rumble that it was and likely not be quite as one-sided.
</li><li> The Sound Four were all capable of holding off multiple ANBU agents in their first appearance, but all lost to genin later on. However, this (and the fact that the Konoha genin caught up to them in the first place) was at least partially because they had exhausted themselves when they ran into two Konoha jonin and had to activate their cursed seals just to get away with Sasuke's body unharmed. Even with this, Sakon and Tayuya still almost won their fights and only lost because of the sand genin's interference.
</li><li> Said jonins were exhausted themselves, because they ran into the Sound Four while en route back to the village, after a mission.
</li><li> Especially true with Kimimaro, who was literally seconds away from killing Gaara and Rock Lee when his illness causes him to die. Given that he was able to defeat the sound four all at once and was able to move with sheer willpower, it is especially evident.
</li><li> One scene in Episode 52 of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a>: Shippuden</em> anime (which doesn't appear in the manga) suggests that Naruto and Sakura faired poorly against Sasuke in their first meeting with him after the timeskip because of their wounds from their previous battle (although they do realize that Sasuke has gotten far more powerful). Yamato is also holding back, not wanting to injure Sasuke too much, but just after he decides to get serious, Orochimaru leaves with Sasuke. In the manga, Naruto was still suffering from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide">Four-Tailed Form</a>'s side effects. He was, at best, half power when he finally encountered Sasuke (even Orochimaru commented when they fought again, Naruto wasn't doing nearly as well before). Likewise, Sakura was still suffering from the poisonous wound that she had gotten from the Kyuubi's tail swipe. Only Yamato and Sai were at full strength.
</li><li> Orochimaru has had to been sick or weak at the time for both Uchiha Itachi and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason">Uchiha Sasuke</a> to defeat him. When he faced both, for example, his body was <em>rejecting</em> him both times, and he couldn't kill either of them (needing their bodies for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">Grand Theft Me</a>). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Its even pointed out later that the only reason why Sasuke beat Orochimaru in the first place is because Sandaime Hokage's Shiki Fujin <em>still</em> sealed his arms, thus robbing him of his ninjutsu.</span>
</li><li> Played with in Sasuke's battle with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Itachi. Not only is Itachi in terrible shape (basically, using the high level Sharingan techniques means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">Cast From Hit Points</a>, with the negative that a night at the Inn does NOT fix you right up), he's damn near blind, holding back, <em>and was actually trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILetYouWin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILetYouWin">let him win</a></em> and yet he still utterly dominates Sasuke, who is in top form. Sasuke only survives because Itachi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncurableCoughOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncurableCoughOfDeath">dies at the end</a></span>. To be fair though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Itachi only 'dominated' when Susano'o came into play since Sasuke had no knowledge of said technique, thus no counter unlike having counters to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">Amaterasu</a> with Oral Rebirth or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Tsukuyomi</a> with his Sharingan mastery and rage. Even Itachi complimented Sasuke's power, and if not for Susano'o Kirin would have wiped Itachi off the face of the map</span>.
</li><li> Pain versus Naruto could have been much more one sided with the odds heavily against Naruto had it not been for the fact that Pain was trying to capture Naruto, not kill him. It also didn't help that he'd just finished fighting and leveling a village, and his most powerful body had its powers disabled at the start of the fight.
</li><li> Sasuke's poor performance against Killer Bee is accredited to him not being fully recovered from his fight with Itachi.
</li><li> Danzo only lost to Sasuke <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">since he was unable to use Shisui's eye and was holding back power to fight Tobi, who was the more dangerous opponent</span>.
</li><li> And going back allllll the way, Naruto's crappy abilities with chakra control are implied to be due to the Kyuubi's chakra inside him. Once he started getting his jutsu under control, he was learning jounin level skills (albeit in a wasteful manner — thank the Sage of Six Paths that he's got enough chakra to burn) and a technique that requires a practically impossible level of chakra control.
</li><li> It's almost a <em>necessity</em> in the Naruto universe; the majority of techniques and strategems are actually fairly accurate for how a ninja with quasi-magical powers would be: an attack, preferably a sneak attack, that tends to be somewhere between a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">ridiculously excessive</a>. The fights would be a lot shorter and the action a lot less interesting if they lasted one panel/minute EVERY single time.
</li><li> Naruto <em>himself</em> suffered this during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarArc">War Arc</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Against Nagato and Itachi, he was starting to run on empty for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Nine-Tailed Chakra Mode</a> due to using it all night, fighting the Raikage, <em>then</em> creating 13 clones to help on several battlefields. When he attempted to create a clone to find Kabuto, his Chakra Mode disappeared and he was left exhausted. Then during the fight with Tobi, he couldn't use his superior speed and barely used any jutsu's against Tobi's paths due to being so completely exhausted from his previous fights. Its only after getting Kurama's partnership he's able to truly pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSecondWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSecondWind">Heroic Second Wind</a>. Even after his Biju Mode runs out, he's completely recharged but he still uses his Chakra Mode conservatively against Tobi so he isn't lured into the same trap he was before.</span>

<ul><li> Later on Signum inverts this instead. She did wake up and has gotten more proper equipment, but she has one more handicap: That injury was very life-threatening that she could end up crippled for life. When she instantly issues a rematch with Cypha, you expect that she'd lose out again or at best only manages to get even due to the injury. What happens was that in a single chapter, Signum completely beat the crap out of Cypha to the point she had to retreat.

</li><li> Later, he also suffers a wing injury during the battle against the Johto gym leader Faulkner, giving him a little bit of trouble against the leader's Pidgeot.
</li><li> Most of the time Charizard loses a battle it's treated this way, examples include the losses against Dusclops (where he was winning until Ash attempted to finish the match using a fighting type move on a ghost type, firmly holding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a>) and Blaziken (because Ash had no knowledge of what a Blaziken was).

When a subsequent battle not only has this happen again, but also destroys her original brooch and strands her and Luna in another dimension, Usagi comes to realize the reason of this happening is because her head wasn't in the game: she didn't <em>want</em> to be Sailor Moon anymore and, because of it, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychosomaticPowerOutage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychosomaticPowerOutage">it was affecting her powers</a>.

She points out that his muscles had severely atrophied from being in a two-year coma (the match happens roughly a month after he woke up), noting that if he had been at full strength, he would have easily won.

She feels horrible over it because it forces a tie-breaker when Gongenzaka forces a draw in his match, leaving You Show and LDS 1-1, a match that, had Reiji not forfeited in a major hurry, would have surely went to LDS. When Yuzu and Masumi have their rematch in the Maiami City Tournament, Yuzu gives Masumi a great fight and comes up on top.
</li><li> Gongenzaka's tag-duel with Sawatari against Tyler Sisters in Xyz dimension was not beneficial for him because of two reasons: (1) His deck heavily relies on absense of trap and spell cards in graveyard (while Sawatari's deck has those) and (2) The graveyard for each team was shared, leading to their defeat off-screen. Of course, Yuya lampshaded this in the episode. Also Sawatari would be crippled if he tried to accommodate Gongenzaka due to how spell-heavy his Abyss Actors were.

Without the control of the visor, any attempt to continue fighting would've run the risk of killing Storm (or any of the audience), so he gave up. Several years later, Cyclops' ex-wife Madelyne Pryor announced that she'd used her psychic powers to <em>make</em> Cyclops lose. This is a relatively easy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> since Cyclops spent much of the fight distracted by a major argument he and Madelyne had just been having, so to say he didn't exactly have his mind on the battle was very easy to change into a result of Madelyne's direct influence.

</li></ul></li><li> In the very first crossover between <em>Superman</em> and <em>Spider-Man</em>, Spidey initially holds his own because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> and Doc Ock had unknowingly (to him) sprayed him with a blast of Red Sun Radiation.

Spidey gets angry and charges Superman, only to have the Red Sun Radiation wear off just as he lands his first blow. As he puts it a couple of panels later:

His ploy when the Hulk simply <em>holds his breath</em> is to kick him in the solar plexus, only working (as the narrative captions would have it) because the Hulk is so surprised at the <em>fact</em> of the blow rather then any physical pain and is forced to inhale the gas. Notably, when Batman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce">tries this trick again</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason">it fails</a>, as the Hulk just waves the gas away with his hands.

A number of other problems had built up over time: his inability to capture Black Mask, beating beaten half to death by the spike-wielding Metalhead, his headbutting argument with Sarah Essen-Gordon, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDeathOfSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDeathOfSuperman">The Death of Superman</a>: essentially a superhero Mid Life Crisis.

<ul><li> When Doctor Strange helped found the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDefenders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDefenders">Defenders</a>, his immune system apparently took a vacation. The writers admitted to brainstorming "how do we keep Doc from wrapping up the plot in one frame" almost every issue. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> when Doc took a break from the Defenders to figure out why he was having so much trouble with his spells.

Next year, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion">Secret Invasion</a></em> revealed he was actually a Skrull impostor. Possible subversion, as apparently Skrulls impostors were as powerful as the originals.
</li></ul></li><li> Similar to the eternal Doombot excuse, Prometheus explained his embarrassing performances since his first, when he took on the entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">Justice League</a>, by explaining that in the intervening time someone had stolen his gear and impersonated him.
</li><li> Retroactively done to every single Superman vs. The Flash race. Superman tries to convince Barry Allen not to return to the speed force and states that he's been able to keep up if not win in all their races. Barry simply tells him "Those were for charity, Clark," and leaves him in the dust instantly. Fastest man alive indeed. This is an odd case; Superman really was about as fast as Barry back when those issues were actually written, but Superman was powered down substantially in 1986. Even if a lot of that power has returned he is not back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">Silver Age</a> power levels, so when those Silver Age stories became canon again, this explanation became necessary.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">Thor</a> is said to only use about a fifth of his full strength when fighting humans, even insanely strong ones like the Hulk, out of fear of accidentally killing them. One of the few exceptions (he specifically noted he wasn't holding back) was when he fought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a> after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CivilWar">Civil War</a></em>, and even after Iron Man's numerous upgrades in the past few years <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Tony didn't last thirty seconds.</a> He didn't kill him or severely hurt him, though. He just turned his suit of armor into scrap metal parts, while verbally abusing him and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">calling him out on his recent misdeeds.</a>
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a> first returned in 2004, she was shown outperforming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> to the point where it was speculated that she might actually be more powerful. It turned out, this was meant to show that Superman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfCardboardSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfCardboardSpeech">had been holding himself back</a> all these years out of fear of causing death or destruction (which Supergirl in fact does in the early issues because she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotKnowHisOwnStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotKnowHisOwnStrength">doesn't know her own strength</a>.)
<ul><li> So when the yellow-clad Weapons Master does fight the flu-ish Superman, this ironically makes Big Blue that much more dangerous. As he tries to explain to the bad people, he doesn't know if he can stop his punches from taking off heads.
</li><li> In one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBronzeAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBronzeAgeOfComicBooks">Bronze Age</a> story, Superman starts having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotKnowHisOwnStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotKnowHisOwnStrength">Does Not Know His Own Strength</a> moments, and fears his powers are growing beyond his ability to control. In fact, the reverse is true: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersAsPrograms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersAsPrograms">Parasite</a> is slowly <em>draining</em> his powers, but he made a point of first draining Supey's sense of self-control that normally keeps them in check. Since he was no longer pulling his punches, they seemed <em>more</em> powerful even though his baseline strength was actually <em>dropping.</em> By the time he figured it out, the Parasite had already drained a good chunk of his energy.

That wasn't because of this; rather, that battle was the flu to set up for the next story arc, which required the Hulk to be significantly weaker than his powerlevel at the time normally allowed.

Her relatively weaker power compared to her mother's stint as the Phoenix's host was due to Rachel actively suppressing the Phoenix's power. She mentioned at one point that she only allowed the Phoenix to use at most <em>one percent</em> of its power.
</li><li> Doomsday has had this trope most every time after Dan Jurgens stopped writing him. His first appearance had him take out the ENTIRE Justice League of the time singlehandedly and fight Superman to a standstill to the death of both of them. He would later nearly kill Darkseid in another match and wipe the floor with Grant Morrison's Justice League. After his death and resurrection post-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OurWorldsAtWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OurWorldsAtWar">Our Worlds at War</a></em>, his flu is that he gains intelligence and as a result becomes so scared shitless of dying again that he becomes unable to fight with reckless abandon and even later learns compassion, both resulting in Doomsday becoming much weaker and getting beaten by opponents that otherwise wouldn't be able to scratch him.
</li><li> A sort of double example for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSpectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSpectre">The Spectre</a></em>. His level of power means that any time he gets involved in a big event, he could kill the villain instantly. Given that this would make for dull stories, he tends to lose encounters with big villains. The writers do usually give some sort of in-universe reason for it. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackestNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackestNight">Blackest Night</a></em> he couldn't smite Nekron, because he didn't have a soul at all.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batwoman">Batwoman's</a> first encounter with Wolf Spider goes largely as expected: she, the more experienced fighter, quickly gets the upper hand and starts pummeling the crap out of him.

However, he was ambushed, already injured, and underestimated her skills. She does noticeably less well later against Jason Todd, who had fewer disadvantages. To complicate things, Dick says afterward that Cass was just testing them and wasn't fighting to her full abilities since doing so would've killed them.

Even so, Voldemort proves capable of casting a dozen spells with a single wave of his wand and Harry only barely wins.

Several chapters later, the thugs' leader, Cobalt Yashi, explains that he had been stalking the two for a while and had a telepath underling of his secretly mess with their minds for weeks to dull their reflexes, make them prone to mistakes, etc until they would be weak enough to capture.

The Slayer he fought during the Boxer Rebellion he'd killed after posing as a soldier and sending troops after her for several days. Against Nikki Wood, he left her sleep deprived by scaring her infant son several times each night for a few days then fought her in a subway car where she couldn't use her weapons effectively.

The problem is that since a Master has to supply Servants with energy, the Servants are not as strong as they would normally be since the energy is divided.
</li><li> A particularly literal example of this occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/SpiderX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/SpiderX">Spider-X</a></em> when Peter misses attending the carnival where most of the X-Men were temporarily 'enslaved' by Mesmero because he had the flu and Rogue stayed behind to keep an eye on him, thus ensuring that Peter wouldn't get a spider-sense warning of the danger Mesmero posed and prevent the team falling victim to the hypnotist's efforts.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/AvengersOfTheRing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/AvengersOfTheRing">Avengers of the Ring</a></em>, the energy drain caused by the portal that sent them to Middle-Earth is the only reason Thor and the Hulk didnt just tear through their early opposition such as the troll and the Uruk-Hai army and cut a path to Mount Doom single-handedly, as they needed time to regain their lost energy; immediately after arriving in Middle-Earth, the vortex had drained so much power that Banner only retained a degree of Hulks enhanced healing, and Thors only obvious abilities were greater-than-average strength and the ability to summon Mjolnir back to him after he threw it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PokemonResetBloodlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PokemonResetBloodlines">Pokémon Reset Bloodlines</a></em> features a few examples of this:
<ul><li> In Chapter 18, two of Misty's Pokémon were defeated by a wild Golduck. This happened because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIsThisFeeling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIsThisFeeling">she was so worried</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">about the possibility of Iris getting together with Ash</a> that her head wasn't in the battle.

</li><li> In Chapter 21, the Team Rocket trio is able to capture a criminal named Felgrand since all of his Pokémon had just been defeated by Ash.
</li><li> In the Whitney Interlude, one night owl of a trainer tries to invoke this with Whitney by challenging her at four in the morning, thinking she'll be too tired to battle him at full capacity. It doesn't work. If anything, it backfired by making Whitney angrier and more motivated to beat him.

According to the alicorn herself, she had to choose between losing the fight and hoping things would work out or winning but incinerating the entire castle and it's inhabitants. Her true power fires a beam of plasma that burns as hot as the sun's core but also requires almost a solid minute of preparation to cast all the spells to protect her surroundings and anyone who isn't her target.
</li><li> Jaune does fairly well against Neo in <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12574905/20/In-the-Kingdom-s-Service">In the Kingdom's Service<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> despite her being overwhelmingly the superior fighter because the car she was standing on a moment ago exploded, leaving her injured, deaf, and physically unbalanced.

Vision does remarkably well against Ultron and the Chitauri but he still realizes he's nowhere near as effective as he could be because, being only an hour old, Vision barely understands what his powers are, let alone how to use them.

Since Gae Bolg inflicts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundThatWillNotHeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundThatWillNotHeal">wounds that do not heal naturally</a>, the wound hinders her and makes her struggle in her next few fights.

After a single battle against Agatha's Mega Gengar, Spectre evolves into Dusclops and Agatha comments that once it has access to it's full power, Spectre will be a match for any of her pokemon.
</li><li> Goku in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/LegendOfTheMonkeyGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/LegendOfTheMonkeyGod">Legend Of The Monkey God</a></em> is considerably stronger than canon, including knowing how to fly and use ki attacks before meeting Bulma. However, when the Pilaf gang steal the dragon balls, they also steal almost all of Goku's and Bulma's supplies. By the time Goku and Bulma are captured in Pilaf's castle, Goku's only had a single sandwich to eat in the last day and a half, leaving him too weak to do anything after blasting a hole in their cell. As a result, Bulma has to save the day by stealing Pilaf's wish.

As <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ranma</span> has been under its effects since he was <em>twelve</em> (though <em>not</em> because of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Genma</span>), every defeat he suffered since then retroactively falls under this.

</li><li> Kara in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/DaughterOfFireAndSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/DaughterOfFireAndSteel">Daughter of Fire and Steel</a></em> ends up getting captured by the military due to the fact that she was still adjusting to her new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses">Super Senses</a> at the time and was suffering from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SensoryOverload" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SensoryOverload">Sensory Overload</a>, causing the loud noises made by the military's weaponry to hurt her until she was knocked unconscious.

Most of the crew being cadets didn't help, and Khan was smart enough to have studied the Enterprise in detail. It also doesn't help that Kirk was just a little too overconfident, thinking the <em>Reliant</em> being silent was nothing and not having shields raised.
</li><li> This is also used to explain why a jury-rigged <em>Enterprise</em> in the following movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIIITheSearchForSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIIITheSearchForSpock">The Search for Spock</a></em> is disabled by one hit from a "scout class" Bird-Of-Prey.

</li><li> In the same film, the <em>Enterprise</em>-B was so new most of its equipment wouldn't be in until Tuesday, and was only being taken out for a spin for the sake of the news crews, hence its having such difficulty with what would normally be a simple rescue. Also, it turns out that Earth, the main planet of the Federation, had no other available ships, leaving the <em>Enterprise</em> as the only one in the sector.

Forced into an exhibition match against the extremely aged Rocky, commentators note how he's extremely out of shape and not taking it seriously. Despite this he still dominates the early match... until he throws a sloppy punch and breaks his hand. This is all the opening Rocky needs to punish Mason hard, justifying how he can (almost) pull off a win.

Echo with her programming is probably the better technical fighter, but Ballard is very big, built like a brick house, and so tough he can take out four gun-wielding thugs with a plank <em>after</em> he's been shot—plus, he's a trained fighter, so all of <em>his</em> experience is real. However, he <em>had</em> been shot mere days ago, and was not looking to actually hurt Echo, as she's his best link to the case. Cue him fighting defensively and eventually getting worn down. On the flip side, Echo was also fighting in order to frame Ballard for shooting a cop, not to actually win, so while she wasn't fighting to win either, her goals were served by simply getting him to the right place at the right time and disappearing.

Jaime is supposed to be one of the best warriors in the realm but has his hands and ankles tied together, is weak from almost a year of imprisonment with inadequate food and exercise, making him completely out of practice and had no armour. The fight in the books is much closer; Jaime holds his own and even gains the upper hand (despite the presence of his manacles) until he realizes that in his weakened state, Brienne is stronger than him (this is notable, because his great physical strength has been mentioned before). The fight goes on until he slips on wet stones, allowing Brienne to get a victory... just before the Bloody Mummers show up. Sandor Clegane, who is one of the strongest and most fearsome fighters in the realm, able to hold his own against his brother Gregor and defeat Beric Dondarrion, gets bitten on the neck near the end of Season 4 and the wound gets severely infected and he has a fever because he wouldn't let Arya cauterize the wound. Arya even points out that Sandor got a lot slower because of it. Loras Tyrell, on the other hand, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">loses to her fair and square.</a> Although he still sort of counts just not being that good of a fighter compared to his book version; his only on-screen victory is a joust where he cheats.

</li><li> Savitar, the so-called "god of speed" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014">The Flash (2014)</a>,</em> is case of becoming beatable by getting uncanned, similar to, of all things, the Power Rangers Samurai example. In his early appearances, he outclasses everyone he fights by an insane degree, can only be seen by certain people, and earns his status as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a>. He claims to be a supernatural force and nearly has the heroes convinced. However, it turns out that he is actually trapped in the Speed Force, and is only able to temporarily appear under certain circumstances. This gives him the <em>appearance</em> of this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem">Outside-Context Problem</a> that can be anywhere and everywhere and can only be seen by speedsters and at certain times; he's not Just That Fast, he's exiting the speed force prison in different places, and he drags opponents through it to disorient them. But he's able to travel through and manipulate a primal force of space-time and can only to appear to others connected to that force <em>because he's actively grappling with it for every second of freedom.</em> Once free, all that's gone and he's just another speedy bad guy - and the Flash has beaten three of those already. Portrayed now with practical effects instead of CGI, he even <em>looks and feels</em> more real and thus more hittable to the audience. It's telling that the scene in which he properly escapes is also the first time Barry is able to injure him. He proves to be a very tough opponent, but the "god of speed" isn't looking so godlike with both feet in this world.
<ul><li> Elsewhere in the Arrowverse, there's Tabitha, Neron's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dragon">Dragon</a> and lover from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow">Legends of Tomorrow</a>.</em> Season finale spoilers here: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> We've got another case of "the curse had benefits" like the speed force prison. As a fairy godmother, Tabitha can do pretty much <em>anything</em> on behalf of the person she's fairy godmother <em>to.</em> Of course, that last part means she has the need to convince her charge to ask for things in line with her plans, and without a charge, she's powerless. However, she was <em>totally</em> untouchable when her charge gave her commands she could work with. Once she tricks another character into taking on her fairy godmother status and is free to use magic at will, that magic is <em>not</em> the same as the near-omnipotent power she had when granting a charge's wish. A powerful magic user who grows stronger by the minute (she's powered by fear and Neron's machinations are giving her a really good supply of it) is like the unbound Savitar: a terrifying opponent, yes, but beatable.</span>
</li><li> The Legends actually tried to <em>invoke</em> that with the previous season's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, Mallus. A demon is limited to what he can do as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Sealed Evil in a Can</a>, but you also can't punch it. The obvious solution... once you have what's needed to vanquish him, free him so you can face him in person and use it on him! Of course, since it resulted in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the death of Rip Hunter and a reformed Damien as well as the freeing of every <em>other</em> prisoner who'd been canned with Mallus, including the aforementioned Neron and Tabitha</span>, they probably don't consider that a success even if they were able to destroy Mallus in the end.
</li></ul></li><li> Arguably true for Worf himself in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a>.</em> He loses a one-on-one battle with the Jem'Hadar, but this was towards the end of a brutal gauntlet of fights where he was given minimal time to rest or recover. And <em>even then,</em> he refuses to yield, earning the respect of his final Jem'Hadar opponent who then refused to kill him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpartacusBloodAndSand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpartacusBloodAndSand">Spartacus: Blood and Sand</a></em>: In the first few episodes, Crixus was a superior fighter to Spartacus. Crixus takes injuries from Theokoles and goes into a coma. When he wakes up and learns Spartacus has replaced him as the Champion of Capua, he angrily challenges Spartacus to a fight to try to regain his title. Although Crixus' injuries are healed, he is slightly out of shape from being asleep for so long and becomes exhausted after a few sword swings, allowing Spartacus to easily beat him down. Spartacus lectures him on attacking him before his body was ready.

</li><li> When your [[insert favorite team in [[insert sport here]] here]] loses a game.
</li><li> The New Zealand All Blacks were favourites going into 1995 Rugby World Cup. South Africa was the host nation, but they hadn't even participated in the previous two world cups due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheApartheidEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheApartheidEra">The Apartheid Era</a>. However, a few days before the two sides were due to meet at the final, All Blacks came down with a case of food poisoning. They decided against re-scheduling the final to keep it secret from the Springboks even though it got to a point where at least one player threw up on the sidelines, and they narrowly lost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownToTheLastPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownToTheLastPlay">by a drop goal from the South Africans in extra time</a>. There is a conspiracy theory involving a mysterious "Suzie" concerning this food poisoning, although most fans now believe the illness was unintentional.
</li><li> A legend has Auburn University cadets greasing the rails before an opposing football team from Georgia Tech arrived, causing their train to slide past the station, and forcing the team to tire itself out walking back to the stadium.
</li><li> Averted in Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals between the Chicago Bulls and Utah Jazz, to this day thought of as "The Flu Game". According to The Other Wiki, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MichaelJordan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MichaelJordan">Michael Jordan</a> woke up the day before the game nauseated and sweating profusely. He was diagnosed with food poisoning. He barely had the strength to get up out of bed, and the Bulls trainers told him there was no way he could play in Game 5. The Bulls would be at a distinct disadvantage without their leader, because the Jazz had just won two straight games to even the series, and whoever won Game 5 would be one win away from the championship. But he rose out of bed three hours before tip-off, determined to play. And after a listless first quarter in which the Jazz ran off to a 16-point lead, Michael led the team back to a 90-88 victory, finishing with 38 points, seven rebounds, five assists, three steals and a block. And then his teammate Scottie Pippen helped carry him off the court.
</li><li> Early in Super Bowl XXXIX, Terrel Owens caught a pass from Donovan McNabb and had an open-field run to the endzone. Unfortunately for the Eagles, Owens was still recovering from a leg injury, allowing a defender to tackle him after a big play that would have probably been a touchdown had he been healthy. The Eagles proceeded to turn the ball over a few plays later and would eventually lose to the Patriots by 3 points.
</li><li> Nearly every losing sports team ever. It can't <em>always</em> be the referees' fault.
<ul><li> In college football, a famous recent example would Colt McCoy at his last Rose Bowl Game. The momentum of the entire game reversed suddenly - all because McCoy got tackled by a nearly 400-pound man early in the game, taking him out of the game. It wasn't even an especially brutal hit, but the physics somehow left his arm with no sensation whatsoever. He didn't feel any pain and his arm hadn't suffered serious injury, but he couldn't feel the football contacting his palm and fingers and thus couldn't make accurate throws. Truly a bizarre moment in sports as a QB had never before been knocked out of an entire Super Bowl or BCS Title game before, much less on such an unusual injury.
</li><li> Two NBA examples: The Spurs in 2000 and the Celtics in 2009 were defending champions but late in the year lost their best player (Tim Duncan for the Spurs, Kevin Garnett for the Celtics) for the entire playoffs and suffered an early playoff exit to an otherwise inferior team.
<ul><li> There is an argument to be made about the Pistons beating the 1989 "Showtime" Lakers team because of this, as well as the 2019 Toronto Raptors beating a Golden State team missing two of their three best players. That same Raptors team probably wouldn't even have made the finals if the Philadelphia 76ers' star center Joel Embiid hadn't been suffering from a virus throughout the series.
</li></ul></li><li> Oddly enough, at least in the US, defeats are always blamed on this while victories are credited to divine intervention. The reverse is almost never the case.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikeTyson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikeTyson">Mike Tyson</a>'s defeat against Buster Douglas is in no small part the result of him expecting another half-round knock out and thus coming in unprepared. To be fair to Tyson, Douglas was much older and nearing his retirement, to the point <em>Douglas himself</em> initially expected to lose and prepared to retire after that fight, only for Douglas' mother to die shortly before the fight, driving him to fight with much more skill and determination he had ever done, resulting in a long drawn fight that <em>still</em> nearly saw Tyson winning before his eventual defeat.
</li><li> The problem of course is that so much of sports championships are based on luck and injuries are prevalent enough in pro leagues these days that nearly every modern championship loss could be blamed to some degree on this.

His sheer exhaustion from the Siege Of Terra (In addition to fighting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">Angron</a> to a draw) led to his defeat at the hands of Horus.

She only got caught by the Bartolls on the first place because she was not in her mecha (the same goes to Kusuha, Arado, Seolla and Latooni), and later on, Juergen managed to 'kill' her because for the same reason, added by the fact that she was just recently and forcefully been plugged out from her cockpit that binds her. She doesn't really have much impact after being rescued, but should you bring her to battle against the Bartolls in Chapter 34, she will express disgust on the Bartolls and show them that in the right conditions, they are no match for her. Unfortunately, however, she could never do it on Juergen (nor that she has any special lines against him when they face off in Free Battle).

Saturos is stronger (and backed up by Menardi) when fought on the complementary Earth-aligned Venus Lighthouse.

This plus the fact that Gelb is one of only two story-ace squadrons in the game that doesn't outnumber you by at least two-to-one results is a slightly easier Ace fight than normal, despite them flying an end-game plane a while before the player has anything that should be comparable.

Prior to his first match he's KO'd by what appears to be a <em>kindergarten student</em> and mocked by all the kid's friends, making him suffer from a nasty inadequacy complex when facing you for the first time, resulting in weakened attacks and a tendency to cower with fear and beg for his mother.

Most of the boss fights could be considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Kill</a>.
<ul><li> The ancient race of Archdragons in particular rely on this trope to varying degrees to even give you a chance against them, and even then they're usually among the series' most brutal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Bosses</a>. It took an alliance of all the ancient gods who found the Great Souls in the First Flame, as well as the aforementioned Seath's betrayal of his kin, to end their reign over the world.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls1">Dark Souls 1</a></em> Seath the Scaleless is, as mentioned, mad, corrupted, and was the only one of his species to not possess the stone scales that made their race immortal in the first place (leading him to betray them out of jealousy). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> Black Dragon Kalameet is (almost) completely impossible to even fight until you get Hawkeye Gough to snipe him out of the sky, nailing one of his wings to his side and causing him to crash, preventing him from flying for more than a few seconds at a time. The stone dragon you find in Ash Lake as the keeper of the Path of the Dragon covenant goes one further by being the only character in the entire game to be <em>completely invincible-</em> you can cut off its tail to use as a weapon, but it doesn't even <em>notice</em> and it's implied it will simply regenerate in time.
</li><li> The Ancient Dragon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII">Dark Souls II</a></em> is a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">Damage-Sponge Boss</a> which has attacks that are almost all a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a>, but you can still kill it in single combat; however <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it turns out to (apparently) not be a true Archdragon at all, but a facsimile created by Lord Aldia with a Giant Soul at its core</span>. Sinh the Slumbering Dragon from the <em>Crown of the Sunken King</em> DLC is another incredibly dangerous opponent, but he was impaled completely through the body by a gigantic spear when Shulva fell, which is still lodged there where you fight him.
</li><li> Darkeater Midir from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII">Dark Souls III</a></em> was an Archdragon raised by the gods themselves to fight the all-consuming Abyss, and has become corrupted by it over the centuries. While this has enhanced his power in some ways (such as giving him a laser beam breath and dark sorcerous attacks), it's also implied to be eating away at him. He still remains possibly the toughest boss in the entire series.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em> has a lot of examples, since the very powerful characters it likes introducing need to be challenged somehow.
<ul><li> Archer is definitely one of the strongest Servants in the story, something apparent after he reveals the true nature of his Noble Phantasm, but he often ends up handicapped one way or another across all three routes.
<ul><li> <strong><em>Fate</em> route:</strong> At the start of the route Archer is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury">surprised and grievously wounded by Saber</a>, who he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">unwilling to fight</a>, before getting thrown against Berserker, who he legitimately couldn't beat, and refusing to hurt <em>his</em> Master Illya, who he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">also unwilling to fight</a>.
</li><li> <strong><em>Unlimited Blade Works</em> route:</strong> Archer spends most of his time trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">manipulate events</a> rather than fighting (on two occasions he <em>does</em> fight, his enemy runs away after one attack, and when he goes up against Lancer, Lancer is also not holding anything back and clearly has the advantage the entire time). After this, he is cut off from his source of mana and then uses his true Noble Phantasm that requires a massive input of mana to maintain for a short period of time, which causes his power to fade until he's only keeping his body together through sheer willpower.
</li><li> <strong><em>Heaven's Feel</em> route:</strong> Archer is wounded by Saber as in the Fate route, then is forced to fight in poor conditions and exposed to attacks which ignore his usual defenses.
</li></ul></li><li> Explicitly called out with regards to Lancer in the <em>Unlimited Blade Works</em> route. In all routes, he ties with Archer and loses to Saber; in Fate and Heaven's Feel, he doesn't get many more scenes after that, but when he and Archer fight again in <em>Unlimited Blade Works</em> he easily defeats Archer, having explained that he'd been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUriahGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUriahGambit">ordered to lose</a> the previous two fights, and Archer only survives because Lancer figures out what he's doing and chooses not to kill him.
</li><li> Rider spends all of the first two routes with a poor source of mana, which causes her to go down very easily. After <em>Heaven's Feel</em> fixes this problem, she demonstrates just how deadly she can be.
</li><li> In all routes, Saber starts out being improperly summoned by someone who can barely use magic, so she has an incomplete connection to his mana and therefore has to recharge herself very often with large amounts of sleep and food, even if she uses only a little bit of her power. This is exacerbated by the fact that she took a cursed, slow-healing stab close to the heart soon after being summoned. It also doesn't help that, due to worries that Shirou's lack of mage skill would leave him open to mind magics, she doesn't let him know her true identity and holds off on using her Noble Phantasm even more than any other Servant. And of course, her Master being unwilling to risk her life if he can avoid it and being unwilling to fight as ruthlessly as possible is a pretty hefty handicap for a Servant of the Grail War as well, even though she herself isn't really all that much more ruthless than he is (especially compared to all the non Rin and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Good Sakura</span> Masters). The other Servants aren't pushovers by any stretch of the word, but as the two times she got a competent mage as a master showed, there is a REASON she's considered the strongest class. And even when she <em>does</em> get a competent Master, she still technically has the Flu because she never has access to her final and strongest Noble Phantasm <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that gives her a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> and effective <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmorality">Complete Immorality</a></span> except, ironically, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when she's still with Shirou.</span>
</li><li> Similarly, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a></em>, Saber has her left hand crippled by Lancer early on, preventing her from fighting at full strength and from using <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Excalibur</span> for a while.
</li><li> <em>The</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a> Worf character, Berserker, has this arguably crippling him in UBW and definitely doing so in HF. In UBW, he's hampered in his fight against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gilgamesh</span> because he's shielding Ilya as well (which is given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> in one of his <em>Fate/Unlimited Codes</em> missions, where he has to fight his opponent while keeping the defenseless Ilya alive). In HF, he gets hit by a gamebreaker ability he can't actually fight against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and is turned into Dark Berserker</span> before he can truly fight. While in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dark Berserker form</span>, the fact that he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is killed nine times by the same attack</span> comes from the fact that he's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">pretty much gone blind from the corruption</span>. And while the Berserker class amps his already legendary strength and speed, it leaves him unable to use any of his skills or non-auto Noble Phantasms, instead fighting almost purely on instinct, reflex and power - formidable, but not as deadly as he would be in a standard class.
</li><li> And the <em>other</em> Archer <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gilgamesh</span>, is the most powerful character by <em>far</em>, and could stomp just about anyone, thanks to being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the first and oldest hero in a 'verse where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderIsBetter">Older Is Better</a></span>. Unfortunately, his ego is so unfathomably massive that he refuses to fight seriously, or even bother to <em>fight</em> much at all, he just stands around while using his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gate Of Babylon</span> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StormOfBlades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StormOfBlades">sword-spam</a> things into nonexistence. He dies every route due to underestimating his enemies and getting manhandled because of it.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has this as something that came into play during the formation of the Book One finale: giving Zuko injuries from both his ship exploding, and hypothermia from his near drowning experience in icy water, plus powering up Katara with a full moon that increases the power of her water-bending. Consequently, Katara managed to win her fight with him despite his much greater experience, and incapacitated him. However, when the sun rose, Zuko one-hit-KO'd Katara. During the third round, it was night again, they were in a freakin' snow storm (plenty of water to bend) and Zuko was half-frozen to death. The next time Zuko and Katara had a real fight he more than held his own against her.
</li><li> Zuko is similarly handicapped by being unable to use any of his Firebending in his fight-to-a-draw against Jet in Book Two. Doing so would have exposed his identity, which, after an earlier incident in the season where he'd shown his firebending in a fight to defend a town and was then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulTownsfolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulTownsfolk">immediately thrown out of said town</a>, caused him to hold back with Jet. Towards the end of the fight he gains a clear advantage once he grabs some real swords, but the guards intervene at that point.
</li><li> This applies in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, in the final duel between Zuko and Azula. Compared to their past battles, Zuko has gained insights into Firebending long lost to his people and was more emotionally centered than he had previously been in his life, whereas Azula is in the middle of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a>. Just before going into battle against her he mentions that he doesn't need <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Katara's</span> help anymore because Azula is slipping and thus he can reliably defeat her on his own. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He loses, but Azula is only able to win by firing a lightning bolt at Katara, causing him to take the blow for her.</span>
</li><li> Team Avatar tries to use this trope to their advantage, by attacking the Fire Nation during an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalEclipseOfThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalEclipseOfThePlot">eclipse</a>, (which temporarily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">prevents firebenders using their powers,</a>) with the intention of beating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Fire Lord Ozai</a> while he's powerless. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Their plan doesn't work, because the Fire Nation had forewarning about it and prepared accordingly, and Azula manages to be a formidable opponent even without her firebending. However, it plays a big part in Zuko's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut">Calling the Old Man Out</a> as he wouldn't stand a chance against Ozai in a firebending battle but is more than a match for him with his swords.</span>

<ul><li> In the first episode, she loses to the Metalbending Police (but since they were police, she held back and wasn't really trying). Later, she loses to some Equalist chi blockers. Korra had no idea they were chi blockers until after they defeated her, though, whereas they had trained to fight benders. Korra struggles inside the pro bending ring, but between being restricted to only waterbending and having limitations on how much she can bend at a time (it's complicated), that's to be expected, and she does still win quite often. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In her first fight with Amon, Korra was badly outnumbered, and he got the drop on her anyway. When Tarlok defeats her, he uses a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">Story-Breaker Power</a> that, as far as Korra knows, is impossible for anyone to even have, and which nobody but Amon can counter at this point. When Amon takes her bending, he uses that same power. Luckily, Korra still manages to win quite a few fights when she isn't at a huge disadvantage.</span>
</li><li> Shows up again in Season 3, this time dealing with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronLady">Lin Beifong</a>; after a physically and emotionally draining acupuncture session, she picks a fight with her half-sister Suyin and barely manages to hold on.
</li><li> The good guys are down three people/ two bending masters (Bumi, Kya, and Tenzin) in the climax of season 3 as they got the crap kicked out of them and are still too hurt to fight.
</li><li> In an earlier battle with the Red Lotus, Lord Zuko is not only hampered by being in his late eighties- he's also fighting at midnight, in the middle of an intense blizzard, making his firebending far weaker than it should be. He still manages to last the longest out of all the good guys, when the rest were master Waterbenders.
</li><li> In season 4, Korra is once again hit with this. Turns out the reason she's weaker than before is because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she still has a bit of metallic poison in her body. It's been there for <em>years</em>. After she works up the mental fortitude to bend it out herself, she is able to enter the Avatar state again, only to have that derailed by lingering mental trauma</span>.

Thus his introduction has him face <em>six</em> Jedi, killing three and leaving the others wounded and traumatized, after throughly wiping out their army and taking multiple steps to scare them to throw them off their game, and every time he appears he takes care to be as intimidating as possible and try and get his Jedi opponents tired by his Magna Guards while also riding on the reputation he built by killing Jedi... But when he faces Mace Windu his opponent is <em>not</em> intimidated at all, and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0gnwyYRHu8">Grievous is crippled in an instant<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoleon</a>'s defeats:
<ul><li> The suggestion is often made that the French lost the battle at Waterloo only because Napoleon was ill with piles (or some other complaint). There's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Voltaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Voltaire">Voltaire</a> short story called <em>Lord Chesterfield's Ears</em> that's based on this sort of idea. In the same battle, Ney's ill-conceived attacks against prepared infantry positions and infamous failure to bring the spikes necessary to disable the British cannon batteries after capturing them (thus allowing the British to retake the cannons intact and resume fire with minimal delay) has been blamed on post-traumatic stress disorder from his leadership of the rearguard during the disastrous withdrawal from Russia.
</li><li> The Battle of Borodino, the turning point toward a Russian repulsion of Napoleon's invasion, was lost (according to some historians) because "Napoleon had a cold." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeoTolstoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeoTolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a> says of this that that means "the adjutant who forgot to give Napoleon his waterproof boots [two days earlier] was the savior of Russia."
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorwegianConstituentAssembly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorwegianConstituentAssembly">Norwegian Constituent Assembly</a> storyline ended with Sweden taking over Norway during the fall of 1814. The King Elect of Norway, Christian Frederick, had to lay down his executive power, to formally end the strife, and let the Norwegian parliament (and government) settle matters with Sweden. The Convention at Moss, written August 14 1814, has a "secret addition" stating that Christian should "find an excuse" for giving up sovereignty. Hence, this trope came into effect, and Worf had the flu all the way from the middle of August until he left quietly in October. Officially, he was sick, but although suffering from fits of depression, he invoked this trope.
</li><li> During the 2012 US presidential election, President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Obama</a> seemed extremely tired during the first presidential debate between himself and his Republican opponent Mitt Romney, who many thought dominated the debate. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlGore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlGore">Al Gore</a> suggested that it was because of the altitude of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Denver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Denver">Denver</a>, the debate venue.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrince">The Prince</a></em>, Machiavelli says that Cesare Borgia revealed to him that his multiple enemies managed to defeat him only because he was seriously sick when they did it.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iran">Sassanid Empire</a> fell to the Arabs because of this trope. Before the rise of Islam, Persia was an regional power with their emperor Shapur II winning a decisive campaign against several Arab nomadic tribes in 325 A.D. However, a series of conflicts with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire">Eastern Roman Empire</a> had weakened it over the decades. By the time of Muhammed, the Persians and Romans were engaged in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">war that lasted nearly 30 years</a> and no substantial gains where being made for either side. When both empires were too exhausted to continue fighting and decided to call it quits, a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">civil war</a></em> erupted in Persia which left it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem">completely vulnerable to the rising Caliphate</a>.
</li><li> Robert E. Lee had heart problems, and <em>some</em> historians and doctors have argued that he was suffering from the effects of a heart attack at the Battle of Gettysburg during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a>. This could explain the less-than-stellar decisions he made during the battle, especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDestructiveCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDestructiveCharge">Pickett's Charge</a>.
