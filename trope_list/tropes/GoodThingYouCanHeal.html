</div></div><p>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> is an amazing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockSuperPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockSuperPowers">super power</a>, capable of feats from quick healing to re-growing whole limbs or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell">one's entire body</a> in seconds. Sadly, it's more passive and less visually impressive than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">Eye Beams</a> or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>, both of which you can show off regularly with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility">Mundane Utility</a> to clue in new readers or viewers that the characters have powers.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>There's only one way to show off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality">immortality</a>, after all.
</p><p>So for writers who don't want to go the route of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyPowersWillProtectMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyPowersWillProtectMe">Luckily, My Powers Will Protect Me</a>" every issue, they have to find new and inventive ways for the hero to show off their regeneration, whether by their own clumsiness, being an accident magnet, or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalLifeIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalLifeIsCheap">target of lethal attacks</a>. Accidents usually include: deep cuts, lost limbs, third-degree burns, and otherwise flirting with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/HowToKillACharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/HowToKillACharacter">sure death.</a> The problem is that while redundant exposition is avoided, the character in question gets a reputation as clumsy to the point that should they lose their regeneration they'd die or be seriously crippled, prompting onlookers to go "Good Thing You Can Heal".
</p><p>Another side effect of the trope is that normally non-fatal accidents suddenly become almost certainly fatal ones just so the character has a death to avoid: If someone with regeneration <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByFallingOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByFallingOver">so much as trips</a>, you can expect them to end up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfPlasticine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfPlasticine">mangled heap of broken bones, many of them sticking out of their skin</a>. And don't ask what happens when they get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutHimselfShaving" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutHimselfShaving">paper cut</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>This can even become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon">canon</a>, as regenerating brawlers come to depend on their regeneration to the point they just use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateInjuryGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateInjuryGambit">painful and suicidal tactics</a> because they can heal from it. Can also be justified as a healing character might be the first one to leap into harm's way when needed because they'll live.
</p><p>It also tends to escalate into a rather gorier version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfBarrage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfBarrage">The Worf Barrage</a>. Since the regenerator can take damage that would otherwise kill any other team member, it becomes their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTailoredToTheParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTailoredToTheParty">"job"</a> to be the target of a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat">No One Could Survive That!</a>" at the hands of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> or recurring baddy because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondLawOfMetafictionalThermodynamics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondLawOfMetafictionalThermodynamics">writers will always expend the expendable</a>. It shows that the bad guy is ready and willing to kill, without actually having somebody die. At its worst, it can break <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief">Willing Suspension of Disbelief</a> by having the regenerator come back from being completely incinerated (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeShifterBaggage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeShifterBaggage">Shapeshifter Baggage</a> is usually involved when that much mass is lost), or a character with clones <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpendableClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpendableClone">casually killing them</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>It's not even limited to characters who can heal; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">any character who can come back</a> from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyAFleshWound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyAFleshWound">normally crippling injury</a> for any reason is subject to this trope. Most noticeable with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg">Cyborgs</a>, who tend to take damage primarily to their repairable or replaceable parts despite a reasonable expectation that their remaining flesh would be more vulnerable.
</p><p>It's generally a safe assumption that a character who uses this trope a lot has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers">Required Secondary Powers</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelNoPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelNoPain">Feel No Pain</a>, although only <em>reduced</em> pain is more common as a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Slapstick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Slapstick">Slapstick</a> - the character will comment that while accelerated healing sounds cool, getting decapitated or shot in the head still hurts like hell. And as anyone who has recovered from an injury can assert, the process of healing doesn't exactly feel great all the time either. Or, there could be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryDrawback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryDrawback">Necessary Drawback</a> — yes, he can heal supernaturally fast, but he feels all the pain at once.
</p><p>A subtrope of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouldHaveBeenMessy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouldHaveBeenMessy">Could Have Been Messy</a>, with "messy" as in "fatal". They tend to coincide if the one getting mauled is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodlessCarnage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodlessCarnage">bloodless</a> (robots, golems, etc.) and has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartDrive">Heart Drive</a> or other means of near-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality">immortality</a>.
</p><p>Related tropes include: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PullingThemselvesTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PullingThemselvesTogether">Pulling Themselves Together</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppendageAssimilation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppendageAssimilation">Appendage Assimilation</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeArmDisarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeArmDisarm">Fake Arm Disarm</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LosingYourHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LosingYourHead">Losing Your Head</a>. Despite occasional griping, these characters tend to agree <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingForeverIsAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingForeverIsAwesome">Living Forever Is Awesome</a>. When a character deliberately injures themselves to prove their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMutilationDemonstration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMutilationDemonstration">Self-Mutilation Demonstration</a>.
</p><p>Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalLifeIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalLifeIsCheap">Immortal Life Is Cheap</a>, where someone who can't die permanently gets killed repeatedly not out of chance, but because those around them know they won't die. Also contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfUndeadRegeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfUndeadRegeneration">Sliding Scale of Undead Regeneration</a>, which can go from this to <em>no healing</em> at all. The comedic version of this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyKilledKennyAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyKilledKennyAgain">They Killed Kenny Again</a>, where a character who isn't established as immortal is repeatedly killed (usually for laughs), and always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery">brought back without any reason</a>.

<ul><li> Yakumo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SazanEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SazanEyes">3×3 Eyes</a></em> has been turned into a "wu", an immortal guardian of the last known Sanjiyan (Triclops) who regenerates even if he has been turned into paste. He cannot die until either the Sanjiyan, Pai, is killed, or she manages to find a way to release him from said condition. At the start of the series, he regularly gets beaten, chopped up, and blown up (it started when he was hit by a bus). At one point, he deliberately grabs a lighter and jumps into a fountain full of gasoline in order to kill a monster. Some of his deaths are simple random bad luck, like the aforementioned car accident; one wonders if he had that kind of bad luck <em>before</em> he was immortal.
</li><li> Since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">Death Is Cheap</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats">Angel Beats!</a></em> (due to being set in the afterlife or purgatory), nearly every cast member has died at least once, and it's almost always played for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>, the title creatures are regularly maimed and mangled in every fashion imaginable. Unlike the unfortunate humans they prey upon, nothing short of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint">cutting out their nape</a> will kill them. Likewise, the Titan Shifters suffer injuries that would leave a human crippled for life, if not outright dead. The stronger ones easily shrug off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg">severed limbs</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlashedThroat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlashedThroat">Slashed Throats</a> and one soldier states that decapitation is probably the only certain way to kill them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And one Titan Shifter survives <em>even that</em>, though the method he used to do so is noted to be extremely dangerous and likely to result in brain damage, so it's not exactly something one would ever want to attempt except as a last resort.</span>

He is an excellent swordsman and notes himself that he used to be better but, due to his immortality, has gotten sloppy. In one fight, he's glad to have an arm lopped off by an opponent, because the loss of the weight made him just a tad faster, just enough so that he can now keep up with his foe.

</li><li> This trope defines <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymore</a></em>. Offensive-type Claymores can lose an arm or leg, and simply hold the severed limb to their stump and have it heal. They can even regrow lost limbs, though the limb becomes regular, human strength. Defensive-types are nigh immortal, capable of regrowing lost limbs in minutes and routinely surviving distractions like being nearly cut in half. Odds are if you like a character who's a Defensive-type, you're going to see her get fucked up routinely. <br/><br/>More specifically, <em>high-level</em> Defensive-types are able to regenerate quickly. The lower-ranked ones may take over a day to regenerate a lost limb, and even longer to recover from near-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTheManHeUsedToBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTheManHeUsedToBe">bisection</a>. Only one character has been shown to regenerate her lost limb(s) in mere minutes, and that's due to special circumstances. Normally, it takes an extreme outpouring of power and effort to regenerate limbs or heal from extensive damage, along with recovery time afterwards. For Offensive-types, even reattaching limbs takes long minutes of uninterrupted concentration. Which can be problematic when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">enemies</a> refuse to show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookChivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookChivalry">Mook Chivalry</a> during fights and consider a lost limb a good opportunity to finish their opponent off.

</li><li> Majin Buu can regenerate even if he's broken up into his constituent atoms, and when Goku and Vegeta escape from Earth as he blows it up he flies from planet to planet, blowing it (and himself) up and simply regenerating each time. Furthermore, unlike Cell below, all forms of Buu show less base durability than the Z-fighters do, equalizing for power. Goku and Kid Buu trading Kamehamehas leads to Buu getting torn to pieces and Goku simply adding to his collection of bruises.
</li><li> Cell, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell">From a Single Cell</a>, loses a tail, an arm, and his entire upper body at various points <em>before</em> self-destructing and coming back from almost nothing.

They have the ability to regenerate and specialized infirmaries exist to actively restore them to full health. Even so, it comes with a price — regenerating fatal wounds or lost limbs shortens their (potential) lifespan in the process.

<ul><li> Ed's metal limbs get chopped off pretty often, but his real limbs barely get hurt. Similarly, the only place Al has never been hurt is the blood seal at the base of his neck, which is also the only part that Ed cannot repair. This is mostly because Ed often uses his automail arm to <em>protect</em> his fleshy parts because he knows they can be repaired, and Al takes special care to avoid taking damage to his bloodseal because any damage to it would kill him.
</li><li> In his first meeting with Al, Greed invokes this deliberately, having a henchman literally smash his face off with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer">big hammer</a> to demonstrate the Homunculi's healing factor. In general, all the homunculi have a tendency to get sliced, diced, and shot to pieces throughout the series.

Thanks to that, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> can survive being shot, being stabbed several times, having Gankutsuou's eyes pierce through his skull, and even being deliberately stabbed by Fernand's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a></em> in an awesomely impressive scene</span>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em>, cyborgs can recover from (or rather, be repaired from) pretty much any injury that doesn't affect the brain. The Major, in particular, has a tendency to get limbs (and in one case, her <em>head</em>) blown off, but other characters are not exempt from this. Twice, if you're counting both the TV series and the first movie.
</li><li> Kenji Murasame in his appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GiantRobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GiantRobo">Giant Robo</a></em> is so known for this it earned him the nickname 'Murasame the Immortal' and is instrumental to the finale.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gunnm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gunnm">Gunnm</a>/Battle Angel Alita</em>. Not a direct application of this trope, since neither Gally nor her gigantic cyborg foes regenerate per se. However, since the in-universe rule of thumb is that as long as the brain is intact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology">it can be grafted into any kind of body overnight</a>, it amounts to the same thing.

The only thing that can destroy a Guyver is the destruction of the control metal <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which is what happened to Guyver II</span>.
</li><li> Another cast member, Aptom, can not only grow back completely, including memories, from the smallest smattering of his body, but he can even clone himself this way. However, he does require biomass to do so, which he gets from absorbing opponents — gaining their abilities and appearance in the process. Shades of The Thing here.
</li></ul></li><li> Exemplified in the humor manga <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HannahOfTheZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HannahOfTheZ">Hannah of the Z</a></em>, where the titular character's power is absurdly powerful regeneration — but her body is also comically weak in every other way, to the point where simply attempting to poke through the cap of a milk bottle or pick up a heavy object can cause her bones to break.

Pretty much everyone else in the series, though, averts this trope. In fact, Alucard does this quite often when faced with non-magic weapons.

After, Recovery Girl points out that even with her healing, he's caused permanent damage, and flatly tells him she will <em>not</em> be healing any more of his self-inflicted injuries. It's the only way she can think of to force him to stop hurting himself.

</li><li> Tsunade also qualifies, being stabbed and slashed repeatedly by Orochimaru during their fight and shrugging it off with her Genesis Rebirth technique. She can heal from even the most grievous of injuries, but with the trade-off that it accelerates her natural aging and reduces her lifespan.
</li><li> Orochimaru himself. His regenerative powers have let him survive getting set on fire while bombarded with shuriken, having his face ripped open, getting his neck broken, having one arm torn off, his whole body getting ripped into two pieces, getting pounded into the ground head first by a giant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon">Breath Weapon</a>, and having sword repeatedly cut the pieces of him apart; it's always been sealing techniques that had any permanent effect. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfDiminishingDefensiveEffort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfDiminishingDefensiveEffort">It doesn't even seem like he's even TRYING to avoid half this stuff</a>.

</li><li> The users of Logia Devil Fruits display a sort of pseudo-regenerative ability. If their bodies are cut or otherwise injured while in their elemental state, they can simply reform themselves using their element. However, this regenerative ability only applies when their elemental bodies are harmed. If their true bodies are harmed, through Haki or other means, they receive damage and feel pain as a normal human would, and cannot heal from it with their powers.
</li><li> Healing is the primary aspect of Marco's Devil Fruit, which allows him to transform into a phoenix of blue flames. Like how the phoenix is said to rise from its own ashes, Marco is able to regenerate from any injuries using his blue phoenix flames. Unlike Logia Devil Fruits whose pseudo-healing is simply reforming their elemental bodies or using their fluid-like states to avoid the blow in the first place, Marco's ability actually heals his injuries, placing his regenerative capabilities a step higher than Logia fruits.

<ul><li> Both Vash and his brother Knives have a very impressive regeneration capability. However, Vash appears to have less so, as his body looks like it was sewn back together very, <em>very</em> poorly. In the manga, it's shown that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Plants in general</span> have the capability to regenerate; however, it has a limit. They can only regenerate so much before it kills them. The way one can tell is by watching the color of their hair, as regeneration will cause their hair to slowly turn from its normal color to black. Once every strand is black, the individual dies. Problem is, Vash is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">almost completely raven-haired by this point</span>. At the end of the manga, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">both Vash and Knives'</span> hair have gone completely black, indicating they're both a <em>very</em> short way from death. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Knives' went as such due to <em>reconstructing his body from almost nothing</em>; he later uses his power to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">create an apple tree</a>, and it's heavily implied that this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath">finally killed him</a>.</span>
</li><li> The reason for Vash's lesser regenerative ability is that Knives replenished his own power by absorbing other Plants and taking their own power into himself.

<ul><li> The Crusniks, to an almost absurd level. When main character Abel Nightroad gets into a fight, especially in his Crusnik form, he's almost guaranteed to get mangled in some way. If someone pulls a gun, he usually takes at least one bullet. In one instance, he survives<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> having the left half of his torso, including an arm, a wing, and (presumably) his heart obliterated by a tank. He regrows them in a matter of moments by having the nanomachines in his blood actually eat the charred hunks of flesh before returning to his body, much to his enemy's horror</span>. Father Tres, being an android, has a similar propensity to take damage (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">flame-wielding vampire</a> once hit him point-blank in the face), though not to the same extent.

<ul><li> Wolverine from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> combines his regeneration with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a> to be pretty damn careless. In one instance, his <em>entire body</em>, save his adamantium skeleton, is incinerated by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a>, and he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell">regenerates from a handful of brain cells left in his cranial cavity.</a> Said skeleton is actually an example. Should he ever lose his healing factor, the metal in his skeleton will kill him.
</li><li> On one occasion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateXMen">Ultimate X-Men</a></em>, he had another mutant blast him with fire in order to break him out of his restraints, which burned off much of his skin and hair (but not his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPants">Magic Pants</a>). This was — of course — done since he could (and would) regenerate from the damage.
</li><li> They're really going all-out in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate universe</a>. When Ultimate Wolverine was possessed by Proteus he got hit by a truck. The aftermath is never explicitly shown but implied to be so gruesome that the X-Men have to wait a few minutes for Wolverine to regenerate his mouth and vocal cords before they can talk to him again. When his mind got swapped with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Peter Parker's</a>, Peter accidentally cuts off one of Wolvie's fingers so the writers can show it growing back. When Wolvie gets ambushed by some mercenaries with an unexplained grudge against him the leader spends a long time shooting him in the forehead just to torture him. He also gets shot <em>a lot</em>. So much so that he often doesn't even notice until after the battle when he realizes he still has bullets lodged under his skin. Apparently, the guards at the Weapon X program used to entertain themselves by shooting Wolverine over and over so they could watch him regenerate.
</li><li> When Wolverine went after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUltimates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUltimates">Hulk</a> in the Ultimate universe. Hulk at the time was at peace (literally sitting on a throne, surrounded by riches, fine food and drink, and half-naked servant girls). He was a little upset at Wolverine for disturbing him... And ended their fight by tearing him in half at the waist and throwing his legs on top of the mountain. This is resolved in flashback: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeaser">introduction</a> would be Wolverine dragging his torso up the mountain to find his lower half, not before he bleeds to death, but before his body heals in such a way that he would have to cut himself apart to again put himself back together.
</li><li> This is also how Marvel lampshades Logan's near-constant cigar smoking: the Healing Factor "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodSmokingEvilSmoking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodSmokingEvilSmoking">makes it okay</a>". In-depth explanation: Wolverine cannot get cancer. If one of his cells turns cancerous, the surrounding cells will immediately team up and beat the cancer out of it. He's THAT violent.
</li><li> In one comic he drives several Nazi death camp commandants crazy by just letting them execute him over and over again and turning up again later as if nothing's happened. At one point he just stands in a gas chamber and refuses to die.
</li><li> This trope is also later subverted by Ultimate Wolverine. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He loses his healing factor and becomes Cable. As Cable he has to rely more on planning and wits now that he can die from massive damage.</span>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Wolverine">Wolverine</a></em> anime shows seems to have this in spades. While he does occasionally dodge, he spends quite a bit of time losing huge chunks of skin and flesh. At one point, he's knocked to the floor and loses a chunk of forehead big enough to show his skull.
</li><li> During the period where he lost his healing factor, he picked a fight with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackPanther">Black Panther</a>. Panther easily overpowered him while noting that Logan's entire fighting style hinges on his body's ability to absorb damage, a style that was useless in his current state.
</li><li> It's been noted in-universe that Wolverine's healing ability has made him careless. Since he's able to recover from nearly any damage and has long since gotten accustomed to extreme pain, he tends to let himself take normally-lethal injuries just to keep the fight going or escape a bad situation just because it was faster than a more measured approach.
</li></ul></li><li> The comparatively minor character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shatterstar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shatterstar">Shatterstar</a> from the spinoff <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XForce">X-Force</a></em> has correspondingly less extreme healing abilities... but he needs them because his signature attack is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateInjuryGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateInjuryGambit">stabbing himself through the gut to impale somebody standing behind him</a>.

In an early solo story, Robotman tracks an escaped killer through a booby-trapped island and rips off all his limbs to use them as various tools.

Despite his massive strength, insane rage, and lack of holding back, he does no permanent damage to anyone.

X-23, at least, is a <em>better</em> healer than Wolverine because she isn't constantly fighting massive adamantium poisoning. However, this is somewhat subverted in her case, in that her lack of a full adamantium skeleton means she's much less durable than Wolverine and more vulnerable to injuries that can disable or outright kill her.

Also in the first book <em>Battlepits of Krarth</em>, there's a magical golden snuffbox that can do a weaker version of the Sage's healing (it's big advantage is that anyone can use it). No Sage in your party...good luck, healing is otherwise weak and rare. As well, later enemies can do massive damage and many of them are skilled enough to never miss an attack. In the final book of the series, the Enchanter can find an enchanted armour made of electrum. This armour will recover a random amount of health after each battle.

However, due to his powerful magic, he doesn't just experience normal, run-of-the-mill flashbacks, which would be horrible enough, but things <em>actually repeat themselves</em>, to the point that Ward can see how Oreg's shirt falls apart under the strikes of an invisible whip, and a wound gashes open on his face, with the bone visible. Oreg's body recovers quickly once he's snapped out of the flashback.
</li><li> Most of the characters in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerZelazny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerZelazny">Roger Zelazny</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfAmber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfAmber">The Chronicles of Amber</a></em> belong to a family of immortals who can regenerate from any injury that doesn't kill them. When the villainous brother takes his sister hostage and threatens to maim her if he doesn't get his way, for some reason he's surprised when one of the good brothers points out that "She can regenerate just as well as the rest of us" and calls his bluff. A more dramatic example: one of the brothers claims to have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette">relying on the possibility</a> of the main character being able to regenerate from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">having his eyes burned out</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheZombieKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheZombieKnight">The Zombie Knight</a> is practically built on this. Given how destructive servants tend to be when fighting, it's not uncommon for hector to end fights with several parts of himself missing, his skull showing, or cut in half. Regeneration is so prevalent in this world <em>decapitating someone</em> and encasing the head is considered standard procedure for taking prisoners.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FredSaberhagen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FredSaberhagen">Fred Saberhagen</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfSwords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfSwords">Book of Swords</a></em> series has a magic sword named Woundhealer which cannot be used to kill living creatures because it heals whatever it's stabbed into. Woundhealer's abilities are so potent that one use on an amputee's arm causes the arm to grow back over a period of time. Slicing it through a broken limb will instantly restore the limb. It's also possible to impale one's self on the blade and benefit from constant healing. In an extreme example, a character escaped pursuit by impaling himself and jumping off a cliff. He survived and suffered no lasting physical injury, but it <em>did</em> hurt and he had some psychological trauma after that.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WildCards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WildCards">Wild Cards</a></em> series has Billy Ray aka Carnifex. In this case, there's a little twist: his regenerative ability is somewhat inaccurate, so his face looks rather deformed from all the times it has needed to recover from massive damage.
</li><li> In homage to the frequency with which private detectives (like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PhilipMarlowe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PhilipMarlowe">Philip Marlowe</a>) get beaten up by corrupt cops or gangsters, P.N.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em>, morphing resets the body from injuries — so an injured animal just has to morph into something else. The books deal with this in alarmingly visceral ways. Most noticeable is Tobias, who has no morphing ability for the first few books and remains almost totally unharmed (he rarely entered combat as a hawk, preferring to do espionage for the rest of the characters), but once he gets his morphing ability back, he's suddenly prone to horrific injury in his hawk form. Just one highlight: Being <em>swallowed</em> by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeaMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeaMonster">Kronosaurus</a>. He gets out with a broken wing that somehow stays whenever he morphs, for reasons that were never quite explained in that book. Either way, the injuries the Animorphs have taken include being shot, dismembered, disemboweled, fourth degree burns, fourth-degree frostbite, partially vaporized, partially digested, and even swatted while in insect morph.

<div class="indent"> "We can rebuild him. We have the pottery."
</div></li><li> Another Watchman, Reg Shoe, is a zombie. He can't really <em>heal</em> per se, but his limbs get chopped off disproportionately often since he can just sew them back on.

Reattaching it only takes a few seconds, though it's slightly embarrassing ("Like zer passing of ze vater."). Going well beyond this, as a vampire with a vulnerability to sunlight, he's chosen a profession in photography. Using <em>flashbulbs</em>. If he's the slightest bit careless in taking a picture he goes up in smoke, but it's not a problem since he keeps a vial of blood in his pocket which breaks and revives him instantly.

For example, the protagonist tries to comfort Vlad the Impaler, who has a wooden stake partially inserted somewhere humorously painful, with the knowledge that he will heal. Vlad protests that he <em>has</em> almost healed, just before a demon pushes the stake all the way back up.

One soul is burned to ash and then reforms. Although healing in Hell may not be such a good thing after all.

Wizards' bodies heal at the normal human rate. However, they heal until the damage is fully healed. Harry commented he has taken more hits than a linebacker, and he should have severe arthritis from the cumulative damage, but he does not. This is what allows his burned, maimed hand to eventually heal back into full use.

</li><li> Mages in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDemonata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDemonata">The Demonata</a></em> series can use magic to reattach their limbs and repair severe damage in battle, often fixing their arms and legs back on as they continue to fight. Unfortunately, it still hurts just as much as it would to a normal human.
</li><li> The werewolves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> heal very quickly, and normally this is a good thing (like when Jacob slices his hand open at Bella's house, but the cut is already healed before Bella can get a towel to stop the bleeding). However, this is subverted when Jacob has the right side of his body broken during the battle against the newborns- in wolf form, he heals too quickly and Carlisle has to re-break his bones to fix them.

Breaking their bones is just about the only conventional injury that they can't just ignore, and even then it's only inconvenient because they can't make their own bones and will have to find new ones to get back to normal. Acid and a few other things can actually do meaningful damage, but everything from bullets to knives are generally ignored.

The first time he deliberately let someone shoot him, he had to steel himself against the anticipation of pain, because he does feel it in full; but he found that pain awakened his Rifter powers, and he soon becomes able to go into a divine version of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">berserk state</a> where he ignores pain, feels only rage, and draws on his power to heal instantly.

This is a very good thing because their city is being invaded by monsters that like to chomp, impale, and/or crush anything that moves.
</li><li> This is a plot point in Damon Knight's novella <em>Dio</em> (or <em><a class="urllink" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=nZl0CwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT8&amp;dq=Damon%20Knight%20The%20Dying%20Man&amp;pg=PT9#v=snippet&amp;q=noon&amp;f=false">The Dying Man<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>), which takes place in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFuture">The Future</a> where humans have genetically engineered themselves to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless">glamorous immortals</a> who can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillAllFlyInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillAllFlyInTheFuture">levitate</a> and regenerate injured body parts. Practically the first thing that happens is a mid-air wrestling match in which the protagonist loses his ability to fly and he and his opponent crash to the ground. The opponent's injuries heal in a few minutes, but Dio's not... that's how he finds out what's going to happen to him. Later on his friend Claire is underwater with her friend Ross, who drowns; his lungs exude a jelly that protects him until the responders get there. It looks gross, but he is safe.
</li><li> Played with in a novel of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Drenai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Drenai">Drenai</a> saga. One of Waylander's enemies has magically-endowed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">regenerative capabilities</a> that make him effectively unkillable. All well and good against Waylander's knives and crossbow bolts, but when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn">his plan to use Waylander as a human sacrifice backfires and a demon arrives to claim HIM</a>..."Ah.

The recruits all have a device called a <em>shieldwatch</em> that can restore most injuries by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster">rolling back time</a> to when they were uninjured. As a result, the instructors can make their training regimen extremely brutal. Lycus explains that the training is designed to encourage this. Since the recruits can survive most injuries and be instantly restored, the main limitation becomes a recruit's ability to endure pain.
</li><li> A less injurious variation occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFellowshipOfTheRing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFellowshipOfTheRing">The Fellowship of the Ring</a></em>: Frodo is given a shirt of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mithril" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mithril">mithril</a> mail that makes him nigh-invulnerable. Thereafter, on several occasions, the Fellowship is ambushed by orcs who take potshots at them. Frodo is always the only person to get hit (with one exception of Gandalf's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatDamage">hat</a>), but because of his armor is perfectly fine.
</li><li> Aeduen of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWitchlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWitchlands">The Witchlands</a></em> is the only POV character gifted with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>, so it follows that he gets shot, stabbed, cut, maimed and otherwise damaged several times more than all other POV characters combined.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStormlightArchive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStormlightArchive">The Stormlight Archive</a></em>, people with Surgebinding abilities can regenerate almost any injury as long as they have a reserve of Stormlight, which leaves them pretty cavalier about getting creatively hurt. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shallan</span> even weirds out a trusted subordinate by (muzzily) giving him orders while she has a crossbow bolt sticking through her head.
</li><li> Tennyo in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse">Whateley Universe</a> has such a phenomenal regeneration ability that literally nothing seems to stop her. She once had her leg blown off by cyborgs with vulcan cannons, and she regrew the leg by the time it took her to fly over and grab the cyborgs.

When she gets mad, she has regrown entire limbs and parts of her face in time to continue up an attack she was already doing, <em>before she even realized the body parts were missing</em>. Other characters have theorized that she isn't being healed so much as restored from a master copy woven into the very fabric of the universe.

Unfortunately, others seem to take this as an invitation to hurt him or put him in danger, assuming he'll just heal and not realising that he has to be just about dead for the power to kick in.

Daylen later invokes this trope on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ahrek</span> to subdue him.
</li><li> Every human has great recovery because they all have medical nanites in them soon after birth in K.C Alexander's <em>SINless</em> series. With a badly contaminated atmosphere and insane levels of global warming, humanity needs those medical nanites to repair cellular damage and snip out the inevitable cancers. They also greatly speed a person's ability to get back to normal after having broken bones or various other injuries. These nanites have their limits and aren't going to regrow a lost limb and contemporary drugs are designed to override the nanite protection so the drug trade is still a constant.
</li><li> Sven Tveskoeg has people wondering what he has floating in his DNA in David Gunn's <em>Death's Head</em> series. While he can't regrow his lost arm which has been replaced with a bionic one, Sven once got up after stuffing his intestines back inside himself after he was disembowelled. He also occasionally hides knives inside his organic arm, which requires him to cut out and pull a large chunk of meat.

<ul><li> Angel is usually the one who gets shot, stabbed, etc., because as a vampire he's pretty hard to kill. In fairness, though, it's not just him.
<div class="indent"><strong>Angel:</strong> Do you know how hard it is to think straight with a piece of rebar through your torso? <br/><strong>Cordelia:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Actually, I do</a> — benefits of a Sunnydale education!
</div></li><li> This is also something of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion">Actor Allusion</a>, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharismaCarpenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharismaCarpenter">Charisma Carpenter</a>, who plays Cordelia, had received that injury herself earlier in her life. In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenInInfirmity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenInInfirmity">the manner of Cordelia's injury was written so that Carpenter's real-life scar could have an accurate in-universe explanation</a>.

<div class="indent"><strong>Cordelia:</strong> Angel, you don't look so... well it's a good thing you heal fast!
</div></li><li> Angel sustaining (and quickly recovering from) an injury that would kill a normal human is pretty much a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode">Once per Episode</a> thing. Probably the most blatant example is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS04E07ApocalypseNowish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS04E07ApocalypseNowish">Apocalypse, Nowish</a>": Angel is staked in the neck and thrown off a building, and in less than a <em>minute</em>, we see him looking fine. Even within the show, only a few minutes could have passed.
</li><li> Buffy, Faith and Kendra (Slayers, basically) also heal faster than regular humans, which can lead to awkward questions posed by those who are not in the loop. For example, in the season 2 episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS2E11Ted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS2E11Ted">Ted</a>", the police wouldn't believe Buffy hit her stepfather in self-defence, because she had no bruise where he had hit her.

<ul><li> The Doctor can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor">survive stuff that should be fatal</a> and can quickly recover from much worse injuries than a human can, even without recasting the part. He's regrown a hand, for one thing, and has been tortured enough times to give anyone else <em>wicked</em> PTSD. The spin-offs novels and audios, which don't have to worry about scaring kids or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyViolence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyViolence">upsetting parents</a>, take this even further. It is taken to absurd extremes in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E17E18TheEndOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E17E18TheEndOfTime">"The End of Time"</a> when he jumps from a spaceship and falls several hundred feet, crashes through a glass dome, and impacts a marble floor at terminal velocity, and receives nothing more than a few scratches to his face.
</li><li> The Alzarians, a humanoid race featured in the early Eighties, are also able to recover from injury more rapidly than humans, a relic of their highly adaptable Marshmen ancestors. However, the Doctor's Alzarian companion, Adric, indicates that the speed of recovery decreases with age. ("Old people take a bit longer, of course. Sometimes a whole day.")
</li><li> When he resurfaced in the third series of <em>Torchwood</em>, Jack Harkness exploited his ability for the team's benefit. However, it's seriously downplayed, and he can often go entire episodes without his power coming up. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS29E13LastOfTheTimeLords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS29E13LastOfTheTimeLords">"Last of the Time Lords"</a>, Jack has obviously spent an entire year being killed in whatever gruesome ways the Master could come up with, all for his own personal amusement.
</li><li> It's a good job the Timeless Child can regenerate, because they go through multiple lives before reaching adulthood, and before their adopted parent dies of old age. The first regeneration, at least, was an accident; it's unclear whether the subsequent ones were deliberate experimentation or just the result of extreme bad luck and clumsiness.

This, coupled with the fact that he is prone to occasionally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">jaw-dropping stupidity and recklessness</a>, means that the only real mystery is how the hell he managed to survive <em>prior</em> to getting his power.

</li><li> During the five days of <em>Children of Earth</em> in series 3, Jack dies <em>six</em> times. To put this into perspective, this was in the space of five episodes.

Whenever a vampire needs to temporarily incapacitate another vampire, it's most often accomplished via a broken neck.
<ul><li> While nothing as extreme as regrowing a severed arm or leg has occurred, Damon's eyes were gouged out once only to be regenerated in time for the next scene, though he did constantly rub his eyes and complain about how sore they were for the rest of the episode.
</li><li> Humans who drink vampire blood will also gain a temporary healing factor, though it's still not as powerful as a vampire's healing factor. Drinking vampire blood doesn't allow a human to survive instantly fatal injuries such as a broken neck or drowning, at least not while staying human. They will recover, but they will become a vampire themselves in the process.

<ul><li> "Fast Healing" and "Regeneration". The difference: Fast Healing heals any damage, but cannot restore limbs and doesn't work past death; Regeneration can regrow anything, including the head, but has something that bypasses the regeneration (usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">fire</a>.)
</li><li> Some players opt to treat their hit points as a kind of "alternative armor", being fine with taking near-lethal damage as long as they can take down the enemy first. This tactic depends heavily on them having either the aforementioned regeneration/fast healing or a very dedicated healer. Said healer might not be too happy about having to expend their limited magic on patching up a suicidal fighter all the time.

Presumably, other characters can do this too, provided that their organic parts weren't removed by force, and their metal pieces are still intact. Nocturn is a character who could even regrow an arm after Pridak had torn it off, but he wasn't able to grow a new tentacle (this is why he uses a launcher in that hand instead).

He is also able to spin while in this state to further damage someone hit with this attack, with his sword still in him. Yoshimitsu can also spin away from his opponent at an incredibly rapid speed, an attack that requires expending his own life to do, and which causes him to lose his balance and faint temporarily if done excessively. Yoshimitsu from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries">Soul Calibur</a></em> series has similar techniques including flying into the air, lighting his sword on fire, then stabbing it through his own chest and dropping out of the air onto your opponent for massive damage to both you and your opponent.

Of course, the solution is obvious, and several classes have abilities to make it a perfectly survivable tactic, including the Priest's Levitate, Rogue's / Druid Cat-Form's reduced falling damage, etc. Warlocks and Shamans don't have these... but they <em>do</em> have the ability to occasionally self-resurrect, leading to a lot of Warlocks and Shammys going 'splat'.
<ul><li> Then there is Divine Intervention, a Paladin skill that kills the Paladin but makes the target invulnerable when things go badly. The saved ally can then resurrect the Paladin and the others.

In slow motion, with the hand itself going flying off and the still sparking stump shown as Brainiac falls into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PietaPlagiarism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PietaPlagiarism">Pietà Plagiarism</a> in Lighting Lad's arms. Thankfully, he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoAnythingRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoAnythingRobot">Do-Anything Robot</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TelescopingRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TelescopingRobot">telescoping</a> extensions, so he could heal right quick. Didn't make the let down any easier to take though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em> has an interesting example about this trope. Shego has only ever used her claws to slice Kim's clothing when Kim was wearing clothes that were self-repairing. The second time, Shego sliced through the battle suit and cut Kim enough that it resulted in blood. After the battle suit regenerated itself, Kim's wounds were never seen ever again. Apparently, the battle suit healed not only itself but also the wounds of its wearer. Weird...
</li><li> Swampfire in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce">Ben 10: Alien Force</a></em>. Those Lasers go right through him... then the holes immediately close. This has become part of Ben's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootingSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootingSuperman">basic fighting style</a> with him. Also Goop, the green, goo alien. Because he has no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfPlasticine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfPlasticine">skin or any other form of protection</a> it is reasonable that he gets obliterated and then reforms.
</li><li> In the "Coon &amp; Friends" trilogy of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>, it's revealed that Kenny coming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a> isn't just a gag, but an actual superpower. That he's had to use his power hundreds of times by the time he's turned ten is apparently a coincidence.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurryReminder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurryReminder">like an actual sponge</a>, is often shown with regenerative abilities that border on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh-Invulnerability</a>, and really gets to show them off in some instances:
<ul><li> One <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalloweenEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalloweenEpisode">Halloween Episode</a> had Patrick shave SpongeBob down so he would be rounded instead of square to fit in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedSheetGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedSheetGhost">Bed Sheet Ghost</a> costume. Of course, Patrick being an idiot, he shaves SpongeBob down to his brain, scaring everyone (including the Flying Dutchman). Afterward, SpongeBob tells a frightened Patrick "Don't worry! It'll grow back!"
</li><li> He has ripped off his arms 40 times in one episode, recovered from being completely liquified, taken a thousand punches in the face, gotten dragged through a field of giant clams, cheese graters and educational television, and has been ripped in half. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAsTheyNeedToBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAsTheyNeedToBe">Ironically</a>, the latter event occurred in an episode that revolved around Spongebob never leaving his house for fear of hurting himself after smashing his hip. Once, he ripped <strong>himself</strong> in half as part of a victory dance.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> wobbles back and forth on this. You have Optimus Prime being dismembered in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1">Transformers: Generation 1</a></em> and being okay, but a few shots to the torso kill him one movie later. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> Waspinator explodes so much that Rattrap has a collection of his parts, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dinobot</span> dies just with minimal injuries. In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>, people live with just their heads; in another, a stab to the gut nearly kills you dead.
<ul><li> These can be justified by Transformers having different anatomy: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dinobot</span> died because he was low on energon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">but continued to fight anyway</a>. In <em>Animated</em> most of their important parts appear to be <em>inside</em> their heads and body, so a stab to the gut could be fatal while being decapitated would be the equivalent of cutting/disconnecting the cord connecting a computer and the monitor (debilitating, but reversible).
</li><li> After Starscream gains immortality from an AllSpark shards, he becomes a complete magnet for injury. Right after this happens Megatron proceeds to kill him five times, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathMontage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathMontage">back to back.</a>''

<ul><li> When Slade came <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>, one of the first things that happened was Robin unleashing a series of vicious kicks to the head that he would probably have not got hit with earlier. From his reaction and the <em>cracking</em> noises when he straightened his head, it seems they broke his neck. However, it's later shown that while he was brought back to life <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemBones">his flesh wasn't</a></em>, so it's probably a lot easier to break his bones.
</li><li> Cyborg often loses arms and legs, thanks to his mechanical nature. In the third-season finale, he is almost completely dismembered during a battle with the also-cybernetic Brother Blood. Naturally, he gets better.

In several pieces. Deadpool, as usual, is completely unfazed by this (although he is upset about losing his favorite gun) and has to get the parts aligned just right for it to re-attach properly.
</li><li> Wolverine in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen">X-Men</a></em> animated series.

Their superior tells them they have to storm an enemy base from a helicopter and it must be done really fast. "How fast?" "You aren't going to use a parachute". Cap'n knows he can do it, but he looks worried at Logan (didn't have the adamantium bones yet), who reassures him he'll be ok. They then jump, Cap'n stands like nothing happened, and sees the poor soldier in the ground, with his legs terribly broken. He's going to go for help, but Logan tells him it's ok, then he regenerates, stands and tells Cap'n they have a mission to do.

<ul><li> Most amphibians can regenerate lost and damaged limbs to a degree that reptiles, birds, and mammals could only dream of. The African hairy frog takes advantage of this by using <em>its own intentionally broken toe bones as DIY claws</em>. Males grow structures of dermal papillae during the breeding season that look uncannily like sideburns. This huge coincidence has earned the species some fame on the Internet as "the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> frog".
