<p>A plot detail, or even the entire plot, is formed due to a technical difficulty in real life. Perhaps budget cuts prevented a certain aspect of the work from being filmed/programmed/drawn, or perhaps at the time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">technology wasn't advanced enough</a>, or some other limitation to creating the feature existed.

</li><li> How did the production team of apocalyptic mecha anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> get around sudden budget issues during their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>? The show had flirted with postmodernism and surrealism throughout; the end of the show went fully into it as reality itself broke down. Conveniently, this meant they could use a lot of clips and stripped down animation, along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveTheCameraRunning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveTheCameraRunning">Leave the Camera Running</a> being abused at some notable points.

</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama">Akira Toriyama</a> had the idea for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Saiyan</a> transformation for a while, it wasn't until Goku attained it that he figured out what it would look like. Famously he chose yellow hair, mainly so that he and his assistant wouldn't have to ink in Goku's normally black hair. This also resulted in a bit of discontinuity with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie">Non-Serial Movie</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZLordSlug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZLordSlug">Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug</a></em>, which depicts Goku's Super Saiyan form as having black hair and a red aura as a result of being released before Toriyama himself had decided on this look but after he had started planning on introducing it soon.
</li><li> Heavy spoilers for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateApocrypha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateApocrypha">Fate/Apocrypha</a></em>: Shirou Kotomine was created for various reasons such as being a foil to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jeanne d'Arc. His true identity is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalDomainCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalDomainCharacter">Shirou Tokisada Amakusa</a>. The fact that he shares the same first name as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">the protagonist of a previous work</a> in the franchise was a very happy accident.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em> had most of its signature elements arise from the fact that the show had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget">No Budget</a>. The heavy focus on dialogue, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode">Once an Episode</a> shadow-puppet sequences, the long shots of silence, and the heavy use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">Stock Footage</a> (Utena's childhood flashback, the student council elevator ride, the cremations in the Black Rose arc, Akio's car, Utena and Anthy's conversations, Utena's transformation sequences, the drawing of the sword of Dios, the various setpieces that intercut swordfights, the bells ringing) all contributed to make a series that at times seemed to have about ten minutes of unique animation per 23-minute episode. There were also multiple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow">Clip Shows</a> despite the show running only 39 episodes, some of which, unusually, contained <em>very</em> significant character development. This forced the show to focus on character interaction, and created the oddly ritualistic feel to its conflicts (the chanting doesn't hurt).

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheVision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheVision">The Vision</a></em> was originally intended by Roy Thomas to be ghostly white, but he eventually had to settle on red instead because the printing technology of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> would have made the page transparent wherever he was drawn.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a></em>:
<ul><li> Similar to the aforementioned Vision, the Hulk was originally colored grey. However, the printing technology of the time kept turning him green. Over time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee">Stan Lee</a> decided to keep green as the Hulk's signature color.
</li><li> Early in the Hulk's adventures, Lee would frequently alternate between calling the Hulk's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a> "Bob Banner" and "Bruce Banner". When informed of this mistake by fans, Lee decided to establish that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs">Banner's full name was Robert Bruce Banner</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman">Superman</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the early days of the comic, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster decided to give Superman a nemesis who was his complete opposite, so they created a character called "The Ultra-Humanite"; while Superman was strong, handsome, noble, and solved problems with his immense strength, the Ultra-Humanite was a frail, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldOfEvil">bald-headed</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> who was wheelchair-bound, but utterly brilliant. Sometime later, illustrator Leo Nowak drew a story that introduced another evil scientist, who had a full head of red hair: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a>. But thanks to a miscommunication with the writer, Nowak mistakenly drew him bald. Nevertheless, his superiors liked it, and since it would be a tad redundant to have two bald mad scientists fighting Superman, the Ultra-Humanite gained a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf">Body Surf</a> gimmick and slowly got pushed to the sidelines before suffering a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookDeath">Comic Book Death</a>, allowing Luthor to take his place as Superman's archenemy. Even later, when the Ultra-Humanite was brought back in the Silver Age as a more minor villain, the writers further differentiated him from Luthor by using his body-surfing abilities to put him in the body of an enormous albino ape—which has remained his default form ever since.
</li><li> Believe it or not, Superman actually originally got his signature power—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick">the power of flight</a>—because of this. In the early days of the comics, he simply had superhuman strength, which he could use to jump incredibly long distances (hence his introduction, <em>"Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound!"</em>). When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaxAndDaveFleischer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaxAndDaveFleischer">Max and Dave Fleischer</a> first brought Superman to the screen for their <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheatricalCartoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheatricalCartoons">Superman Theatrical Cartoons</a></em>, they realized that it was easier to animate Superman simply striking a dramatic pose and levitating into the air than to animate him going through the motions of crouching, jumping, and landing on the ground. Hence, it was decided that Superman could fly—an idea that proved so popular that it was integrated into the comics.
</li></ul></li><li> In one issue of the Marvel UK <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheTransformers">Transformers</a></em> comics, it was mentioned that the Dinobot Swoop was originally called Divebomb back on Cybertron. This bit of character backstory never reached Hasbro, who eventually named one of the Predacons Divebomb a few years later. Because there were now two Transformers who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">shared the name Divebomb</a>, the Marvel UK team wrote a story that revealed that Divebomb stole Swoop's original name after he defeated him in combat back on Cybertron.
</li><li> Many plot points in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns">Geoff Johns</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em> run were influenced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsTheSameAnymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsTheSameAnymore">major changes</a> introduced during the Ron Marz and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuddWinick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuddWinick">Judd Winick</a> eras, which Johns had to reimagine in order to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevisitingTheRoots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevisitingTheRoots">bring the series back to its roots</a>. In particular, his run introduced the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">"emotional entities"</a> Parallax (entity of Fear) and Ion (entity of Willpower) as a cozy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> for why Hal Jordan seemingly became evil, and why Kyle Rayner briefly gave up his Green Lantern identity. Originally, "Parallax" was an identity adopted by Hal after his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>, while "Ion" was an identity adopted by Kyle after he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Took a Level in Badass</a> and evolved beyond the need for his ring. In order to return them to Lantern status, Johns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">"explained"</a> that Parallax and Ion were actually alien entities that <em>possessed</em> them.
</li><li> The spinoff comic series for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> has this regarding the character Azula. As we remember in the series finale, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">brokebrained</a> to put it lightly</span>. One of the lingering fan questions is wondering what did and would happen to her: would she be redeemed or would she stay a villain? According to <em>Smoke and Shadow</em>, the writers got tons of mail from fans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">either demanding that Azula be redeemed or angrily rejecting the suggestion</a> and saw both sides of that debate as having surprisingly good reasons which left the team in a bit of a stalemate.

An easy way to grab readers' attention was to show the hero doing something wildly unsympathetic and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">out-of-character</a> on the cover, forcing them to buy the book so that they could figure out what the hell was going on. Sometimes the bizarre covers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">made sense in context</a>, other times <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext">not</a>. And sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie">they barely had anything to do with the story</a>.
</li><li> All <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a> stories officially took place in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Multiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Multiverse">Multiverse</a> for around three decades of the company's history (roughly 1956 to 1985) as a result of superhero comics briefly going out of style after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. Due to lackluster sales, DC was forced to cancel many of their less-popular series (like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash">The Flash</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hawkman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hawkman">Hawkman</a>,</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica">Justice Society of America</a></em>), only to bring them back when Baby Boomers fell in love with many of the comic books with which their parents had grown up. Since new readers were too young to remember those characters when they debuted, the writers decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool">reimagine them significantly</a> for contemporary audiences, and didn't bother to acknowledge the old versions of them. Later, as a cozy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> for why nobody <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist">in-universe</a> remembered the old versions either, the writers decided that their adventures took place in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParallelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParallelUniverse">parallel universe</a>—allowing them to bring the characters back in limited doses without worrying about the continuity. Then, when the editors decided that explanation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">made things too complicated</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityLockout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityLockout">turned off newcomers</a>, the landmark crossover <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a></em> was conceived as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot">excuse</a> to destroy the Multiverse and replace it with a single universe that was easier to keep straight.
</li><li> In the Fall of 1963, the publishers at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> wound up with a gap in their printing schedule after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a></em> #1 ran into delays, so they asked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee">Stan Lee</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby">Jack Kirby</a> to come up with a replacement on the fly. Since they didn't have time to create a completely original character from scratch, they did the next best thing and made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover">crossover</a> story about five pre-established superheroes from their anthology books battling a pre-established supervillain. In the resulting comic book, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">rich playboy with the robotic suit</a> from <em>Tales of Suspense</em> met the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan">super-scientist with shrinking powers</a> (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWasp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWasp">his girlfriend</a>) from <em>Tales to Astonish</em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thor">hammer-wielding Viking god</a> from <em>Journey into Mystery</em>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheHulk">radioactive monster</a> from the recently canceled series <em>The Hulk</em>, and they all teamed up to fight the Viking god's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Loki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Loki">evil brother</a>. They needed a snappy title, so they named it after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAvengers1960s" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAvengers1960s">a popular spy series</a> that was on TV at the time. Against all odds, audiences loved it—and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></em> has been one of Marvel's flagship titles ever since.
</li><li> During his time with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee">Stan Lee</a> often noted that one of the most difficult parts of writing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero">superhero</a> story was coming up with a plausible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginStory">Origin Story</a> that could explain how the heroes got their superpowers. Eventually, he decided to get around this challenge by writing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">a comic book series</a> about a group of teenagers who simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassSuperEmpoweringEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassSuperEmpoweringEvent">developed their powers through natural mutations</a>; by explaining that the characters were "Mutants", he didn't think the audience would need any more explanation. But after writing the first few issues of his new series, Lee started to think about the full implications of his premise, and the series began exploring how the people of Earth would <em>really</em> react to the appearance of a bizarre new subspecies of humanity with unpredictable (and often dangerous) superhuman abilities. This aspect of the series eventually became the most popular and widely-known thing about it, and <em>X-Men</em> soon became famous for its frank discussion of prejudice, racism, and social justice.

However, because they had a major involvement in the various chapters, and the author found it easier to give some of their lines to other characters rather than rewrite the chapters to have no trace of them, a subplot was added in which the two main villainesses (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Eris</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Pandora</a>) disguise themselves as ordinary kids (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValleyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValleyGirl">Erissa Kanker</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">Dora Sanchez</a>).

In the past when the character was first conceived, he was a <em>Bomberman</em> OC who parodied various aspects of <em>Digimon</em>, named Marty based on the author's own name and his at the time very young, very naive mindset. As the result of the desire to keep the character present in his works, Marty's current name of Mirror M exists because he's literally a reflection of his former self; all of the <em>Bomberman</em> elements in his character were removed entirely, with the <em>Digimon</em> references only maintained as to follow a more traditional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BishonenLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BishonenLine">Bishōnen Line</a> type of trope instead.

At first, when the story was still in its early stages, the author was planning to create original Lucavi for the Stones that the game did not use.

The character's backstory ended up being rewritten so that it's assumed he lost a tentacle in the ocean.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fantasia">Fantasia</a></em> was conceived because one of Disney's animated short films went over-budget. The famous sequence "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" was originally going to be a standalone <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SillySymphonies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SillySymphonies">Silly Symphonies</a></em> short, being envisioned as a "comeback" of sorts for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse">Mickey Mouse</a> (whose popularity had declined significantly by 1940). But as the short's animation gradually got more detailed and elaborate, it got so expensive to produce that it couldn't possibly make back its budget as a simple short film. Knowing that a full-length movie could make more money than a short film, Disney reimagined it as part of a feature-length anthology of animated short films, reusing the basic gimmick of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MickeyMousing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MickeyMousing">a dialogue-free story set to Classical music</a> for each one.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2og3q');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2og3q" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2og3q');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Unfortunately for Disney, the plan didn't work, and <em>Fantasia</em> turned out to be a notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb">Box Office Bomb</a>, possibly because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreAnthology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreAnthology">Genre Anthology</a> format was considered rather experimental at the time.

The sequence was completed mere days before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DistancedFromCurrentEvents/SeptemberEleventh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DistancedFromCurrentEvents/SeptemberEleventh">9/11</a> and the crew decided that showing a plane flying through a city was inappropriate under the circumstances. While trying to work out how to salvage the scene they realized they'd never actually shown how Jumba and Pleakley arrived on Earth. Changing the airplane to a spaceship and adding a short scene of the characters finding the hidden ship meant they could fill this plot hole and keep most of the completed animation from the airplane chase.

</li><li> Hooper was originally intended to die in the screenplay (as he did in the Peter Benchley novel). However, some footage captured by Spielberg's secondary crew, of a <em>real</em> great white attacking a diving cage that was visibly empty (because the stunt diver had unsurprisingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">fled for his goddamned life</a>), was so awesome that the plot was changed to let Hooper slip out of it safely, allowing them to use the shot with the empty cage. Production executive Bill Gilmore joked "The shark down in Australia rewrote the script and saved Dreyfuss's character."
</li><li> The mechanical shark "Bruce" (or as the cast and crew ended up calling it, "The Great White Turd") had a habit of breaking down. While the actors were waiting for Bruce to be repaired <em>again</em>, Spielberg didn't want to waste precious shooting time, so he added a new scene. Specifically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionFilmQuietDramaScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionFilmQuietDramaScene">the scene with Quint's famous monologue about the U.S.S.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clerks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clerks">Clerks</a></em>:
<ul><li> The entire plot could be considered this—director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSmith">Kevin Smith</a> happened to work at a convenience store at the time, the owners trusted him enough to film there in the off-hours, and said owners also happened to own the video store in the same strip mall. (One could also argue misfortune wrote the plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ClerksII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ClerksII">Clerks II</a></em>, as, despite Smith now being a decade older and a respected industry professional, the Quick Stop's owners refused to close the store for daytime filming, fearing the drop in customer retention closing for a month might cause.)
</li><li> Some local hooligans jammed gum into the locks of the convenience store's giant window shade, forcing Dante to make a huge sign that said: "I ASSURE YOU WE'RE OPEN!" This gag is one of the film's most iconic images. But the truth is that Smith could only shoot in the store at night when the store was closed. Having the shades permanently down was a way to disguise the fact that it was dark outside during the daytime interior scenes.
</li><li> This is also why the film is shot in black-and-white: there was basically no chance, given the budget, that exterior scenes (or scenes in the video store) would be shot at the point in the day when the scene was supposed to take place. In black-and-white, you can't really tell if it's 8 in the morning or 4 in the afternoon, so exterior scenes could be shot whenever. (That black-and-white filmstock was incredibly cheap in 1993 helped as well.)
</li><li> The original script included a sequence (included in animated form as a DVD extra) of what Dante and Randall did at the funeral of Dante's ex-girlfriend. However, Smith didn't have the budget to rent a set and a bunch of extras in nice clothes, so just shot Dante and Randall entering the funeral parlor and immediately cutting to them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">being chased out</a>.

Similarly, the procession of monks was not written in the script, but the procession happened to take place as they were filming and the monks consented to appear in the movie. In the second film, most of Lara's outfits have long sleeves, because the concealing makeup used to hide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelinaJolie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelinaJolie">Angelina Jolie</a>'s tattoos in the first movie was not as effective as the filmmakers would have liked.

<ul><li> The entire premise of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator">first film</a> was created because of this trope. The idea was sparked from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnADream">nightmare</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCameron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCameron">James Cameron</a> had about a metallic skeleton walking out of a fire. Cameron felt a robot that advanced could only come from the future; but due to budget constraints, the film had to be set in the present and the Terminator had to be disguised as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots">a human</a> for the majority of the film. The "only organic material can travel through time" rule was also made to save costs on expensive futuristic weaponry.

Rather than ending with John Connor looking through the binoculars, it was to continue on with them taking Skynet's facility, sending Kyle Reese back in time, and conclude with John finding a storage room of T-800s as it faded to the present day. The whole scene was shortened down since they lacked the budget and special effects to create the facility (particularly the time machine scene).

In fact, the Boston Red Sox were chosen because they have a fan base but hadn't won in many years (sometimes explained as the 'Curse of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BabeRuth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BabeRuth">the Bambino</a>').

Therefore, the film ended on a much more happy conclusion. The crew wound up having to film an extra epilogue during the 2004 World Series with Fallon and co-star Drew Barrymore, and you can even see the two of them, in character, kissing each other during a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04syq0ishq8">live television broadcast<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of fans celebrating on the field after the end of the final game.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonWelles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonWelles">Orson Welles</a> suffered from low budget productions later in life. His 1952 film version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Othello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Othello">Othello</a></em> had a scene where two characters have to fight each other. Unfortunately one of the costumes wasn't ready yet, so Welles decided to have the whole scene take place in a bathhouse, where the characters could be naked. It turned out to be one of the most original and talked-about scenes in the film.

However, there was one problem: Shang-Chi's original enemy from the comics was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FuManchu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FuManchu">Fu Manchu</a> — whose rights Marvel had lost decades before. Not wanting to petitioning the estate of Fu Manchu's original writer Sax Roehmer to use the character, Marvel instead found a more pragmatic option for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the Shang-Chi film: the aforementioned <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> real</span> Mandarin, who was always an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of Fu Manchu anyway. Furthermore, the filmmakers of Marvel Studios recognized that having the Mandarin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGalleryTransplant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGalleryTransplant">fight an Asian hero</a> would offset the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YellowPeril" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YellowPeril">Yellow Peril</a> connotations that would likely arisen had the Mandarin appeared in the <em>Iron Man</em> movies. Following this solution, the Shang-Chi film was titled <em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</em>, the subtitle coming from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntagonistTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntagonistTitle">the terrorist group that the Mandarin leads</a> in the MCU.

Since de-aging CGI is hideously expensive (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">and it doesn't always work that well</a>), flashback scenes are often partially obscured by being depicted on fuzzy TVs, with blurs, or just by doing weird stuff with the screen. CLU also frequently wears a face-concealing helmet; fortunately, this makes him even more menacing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The program Tron appears briefly (again, as a digitally de-aged version of his creator's actor Bruce Boxleitner), but spends most of the movie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a> as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Rinzler</a>" — again, making him even creepier.</span> Plus, the fact that the computer world is artificial, but not perfect <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(which, in fact, it isn't, in terms of freedom...)</span>, lends credibility to the somewhat off-kilter and inhuman appearance of CLU, who uses Flynn's younger face as his own.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tron">TRON</a></em> also had its share of problems with the <em>extremely</em> primitive CGI of 1982. For one, the Solar Sailer's wings never quite looked solid. Secondly, there were all kinds of irregular shading and coloration on the backgrounds (which were actually hand-painted due to CGI being nowhere near ready to handle the task). Lisberger had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment">Eureka Moment</a> and realized that <em>of course</em> the Sailer wouldn't look solid and <em>of course</em> there would be glitches and bugs - the whole thing was set <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsideAComputerSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsideAComputerSystem">Inside a Computer System</a>. So, he added a sound effect and the background became atmosphere while the Solar Sailer's translucent wings became an iconic image for the film.

Conveniently, the climax of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em> already showed him dropping his old lightsaber into a bottomless pit on Bespin, giving the writers the perfect excuse to give him a new one. And with the third film already revolving around Luke becoming a full-fledged Jedi Knight, his new green saber was seen as a mark of his advanced status. After that, it became something of an accepted convention that Jedi apprentices wield blue lightsabers, while green ones are more common among more advanced Jedi. This carried over into the prequels, where Qui-Gon and Yoda both carry green lightsabers, while Anakin and Obi-Wan both carry blue ones as Padawans.

So, he wore slippers while filming most of his scenes.
</li><li> The existence of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter">porgs</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi">The Last Jedi</a></em> is owed to an actual species of obtrusive avian; the island used as the setting of Luke's home in the film is also the home of a species of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puffin">puffins<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Since they were a protected species that could not legally be relocated, and editing them out completely would've taken too much time, it was decided that a new alien species of bird would just be CGi'd over them.
</li><li> On a related note, Han Solo being frozen in carbonite during the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em> was written into the plot because of the main actors' contracts. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher had already signed on for a third movie, but Harrison Ford had not, so one of the series' most iconic moments was created to leave the door open for a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em> sans Solo but potentially bring him back if Ford chose to come back (which, as we all know, he did).
</li><li> The Prequel Trilogy (as well as a few early Expanded Universe works) introduced the idea that "Darth" is an honorific title used by the Sith Order (roughly akin to "Sir" or "Lord"), and that the Sith choose new names upon joining the Order to signify <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatManIsDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatManIsDead">the loss of their old identity</a>. That idea started out as a cozy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> for how Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader could be the same person, which was a plot point that Lucas didn't come up with until after he finished <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">the original</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>. If you watch the original film with this in mind, it's pretty clear that Vader and Anakin started out as two different people; when recalling Vader's downfall, Obi-Wan refers to him as "a young Jedi named Darth Vader" (implying that he was still called "Darth Vader" when he was still a Jedi), and he later addresses him as "Darth" to his face (implying that "Darth" is actually his first name).
</li><li> The prequels introduced the idea that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EccentricMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EccentricMentor">Yoda</a> was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Grand Master of the Jedi Order</a> before the rise of the Empire, and that he gave all new Jedi apprentices their first lessons in the Force. This likely started out as a justification for Obi-Wan being Qui-Gon Jinn's apprentice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace">The Phantom Menace</a></em>, despite him referring to Yoda as "the Jedi Master who instructed me" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em>. Considering the many elaborate action sequences that Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon have in <em>Menace</em>, the writers may have chosen to give Obi-Wan a human master so that he could join in on the lightsaber battles, which would have been impractical for a puppet character like Yoda. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5fug2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5fug2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5fug2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Yoda wasn't portrayed through CGI until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones">Attack of the Clones</a></em> three years later.</span>

To get around that, the plot starts with the central family being exiled from the Commonwealth of New England over a religious disagreement, and they spend the vast majority of the movie living in a remote farm at the edge of the forest. Though everything in their family dwelling is period-appropriate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">down to the last detail</a>, it's a very simple dwelling, consisting of little more than a tiny ramshackle house and some stables.

When it was made into a film in 1955, the Hays Code would have prevented both plot points (it forbade both graphic violence and explicit reference to drugs), so the plot had to be reworked to get past the censors.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard">Die Hard</a></em> started life as a loose adaptation of a thriller novel by Roderick Thorp called <em>Nothing Lasts Forever</em>, which was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sequel">sequel</a> to a 1966 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceProcedural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceProcedural">Police Procedural</a> novel called <em>The Detective</em>—which was made into a film starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankSinatra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankSinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> in 1968. Because of this, the studio was contractually obligated to offer the lead role to Sinatra. When he turned down the chance to reprise his old role, the filmmakers chose to drop any pretense of <em>Die Hard</em> being a sequel to <em>The Detective</em>, instead opting to go in a radically different direction. Among other things, this resulted in the grizzled, aging NYPD detective Joe Leland being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool">retooled</a> into the young, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">snarky</a> NYPD detective John McClane, and the female lead being retooled as the protagonist's <em>wife</em> instead of his adult daughter.

(The filmmakers were able to negotiate licenses to use Lethbridge-Stewart and the Autons, but not anything directly related to the Doctor himself.) During pre-production, Courtney had to withdraw from the production due to health issues. In his place, the film features an entirely new protagonist named Lockwood, who's arguably more interesting than a reheated Brigadier would have been and went on to feature in two sequels that develop him in directions that would not have been possible with Lethbridge-Stewart.

Writer/director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarWright" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarWright">Edgar Wright</a> then came up with a gag where the characters are <em>supposed</em> to have Michael Myers masks, but end up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AustinPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AustinPowers">Austin Powers</a> masks due to one robber's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosisFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosisFailure">Pop-Cultural Osmosis Failure</a> — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikeMyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikeMyers">Mike Myers</a> approved the use of his likeness because he liked the joke.
</li><li> The third act of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Deadpool">Deadpool</a></em> was planned to be more extravagant, but at the eleventh hour, Fox swooped in and slashed an additional $7 million off the budget. The filmmakers were forced to throw out a bulk of their planned action sequence, but devised a workaround in true <em>Deadpool</em> fashion: the now-signature joke of the hero accidentally leaving his bag of guns in the cab.
</li><li> By the time the final script of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSocialNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSocialNetwork">The Social Network</a></em> was completed, higher-ups at the studio decided that it was still too long and it needed to be trimmed down. Director David Fincher, however, liked the final draft as it was and didn't want to cut anything, so instead of trimming it down by cutting scenes, he trimmed it down by having everyone talk as fast as they possibly could. This upped the pace of the movie immensely and became one of the best-known aspects of the film after it was released.
</li><li> In the 1970s, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCarpenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCarpenter">John Carpenter</a> and Debra Hill worked on producing a suspense thriller from a script called <em>The Babysitter Murders</em>, about a group of teenage girls who are stalked and murdered by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">serial killer</a> in a peaceful suburban neighborhood. Due to budget constraints, they had to cut down the timeframe of the story (which was originally supposed to take place over the course of multiple days) to a single day, allowing them to keep scenery and wardrobe changes to a minimum. But they knew that the story would be much more effective if it took place on a day with some special significance—so they choose Halloween night, "the scariest night of the year". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Halloween1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Halloween1978">The rest is history.</a>

<ul><li> The Original Series is absolutely made of this trope. An extremely low budget led to the serialization of so many modern sci-fi tropes; things such as deflector shields (thought up because producers and creators couldn't afford to create new models of a damaged Enterprise every time they did a space battle), transporters (because they couldn't create and film shuttle landings constantly), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberForeheadAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberForeheadAliens">Rubber-Forehead Aliens</a> (makeup technology was poor in the 1960s, and the show's creators had to scrounge), and even the first interracial kiss shown on television (the show's actors deliberately sabotaged every take of the scene except for one, which drained their already-low budget). And that's not even mentioning things not affected by budgets, such as cloaking devices and hyposprays.
</li><li> Originally, going down to the planets involved the crew boarding a shuttle and flying down, but the cost of doing landings would have been too expensive, thus, the transporter was created.
</li><li> Inverted with the flat forehead Klingons. Because of low budget, Klingons only had a mostly ethnic makeup in the original series. In the movies and later series, which had better budgets and better makeup technology, they obviously had the ridged foreheads.

</li><li> Played straight with the model used to depict Romulan Warbirds in the original series. The designer apparently wrecked the model after filming its first appearance, and there wasn't time to fix it or come up with a new one, so they used the Klingon Warship's model instead. This led to the conclusion that Klingons and Romulans had formed an alliance, with warships sent over to the Romulans and cloaking devices sent to the Klingons. Consequences of this action influenced the storyline of the entire franchise forever.

So the writers killed off Jadzia, but kept Dax, transplanting the symbiont into a new host, Ezri (Nicole De Boer). The suddenness of Jadzia's death and Ezri's arrival worked greatly into the storyline, with Ezri's main conflict being her having to form new relationships with people who'd already been her (Dax's) friends—and, in Worf's case, husband.

However, the vision mixer discovered that the mixing board was acting up the day of filming in a way that allowed for a controlled overexpose of the image almost to a full white screen. She and the episode's director took advantage of this, quickly called Troughton in, and made the iconic shot of William Hartnell essentially "morphing" into Patrick Troughton.
</li><li> Donna Noble's father Geoffrey Noble was originally supposed to be a supporting character in Series 4 of the new series, but he was said to have died offscreen between the events of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2006CSTheRunawayBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2006CSTheRunawayBride">"The Runaway Bride"</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E1PartnersInCrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E1PartnersInCrime">"Partners in Crime"</a> because his actor, Howard Attfield, became too ill to continue after filming his scenes for "Partners in Crime", and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharacterDiedWithHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharacterDiedWithHim">died of cancer</a> not long after. Forced to come up with a replacement character to fill the "father figure" role with almost no notice at all, the producers hired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BernardCribbins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BernardCribbins">Bernard Cribbins</a>, who had just appeared as a minor character in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2007CSVoyageOfTheDamned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2007CSVoyageOfTheDamned">"Voyage of the Damned"</a>, and was retconned into being Donna's grandfather Wilfred Mott.
</li><li> In a related vein: if Wilfred's role had been filled by Geoffrey, it's unlikely that the Doctor would have taken him on as a companion at the climax of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E17E18TheEndOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E17E18TheEndOfTime">"The End of Time"</a>, since Geoffrey would presumably have stayed behind to comfort his wife and daughter during the Master's battle with Rassilon (whereas the aloof Wilfred, who was clearly closer with his granddaughter Donna than with her mother, had earlier bonded enough with the Tenth Doctor to accompany him during his last adventure).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattSmith">Matt Smith</a> had to shave his hair off for a film role but didn't grow it back in time to sport the Doctor's signature hairstyle, meaning he had to wear a wig over a bald-cap in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2013CSTheTimeOfTheDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2013CSTheTimeOfTheDoctor">The Time of the Doctor</a>". Instead of painstakingly hiding the wig, the Doctor actually <em>takes it off</em> in the episode, and even uses it to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> smuggle a TARDIS-key into the containment field</span>. Once he enters the truth field and starts spouting truths whether he wants to or not, he mentions that he's wearing a wig multiple times.
<ul><li> Even better: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>-explanation for why he shaved his hair off is because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">he got bored one day</a>.

This became an iconic enough image that there is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> to it in the first episode of the revival series, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E1Rose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E1Rose">Rose</a>", in which the Doctor asking Rose to take his hand is a big deal and serves to symbolize her becoming the companion.
</li><li> The show lost budget between Season 4 and Season 5, by which time the producers had decided to concentrate on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Horror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Horror">Horror</a> and no longer had the benefit of "historicals" as cheap episodes (which could take advantage of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropRecycling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropRecycling">Prop Recycling</a> and a BBC crew skilled at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CostumeDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CostumeDrama">Costume Drama</a>). The result of this was the development of the "Base Under Siege" story format, iconically associated with the Second Doctor — tightly plotted, suspenseful horror where the Doctor enters an isolated place besieged by something malevolent and helps the people within fight back against it. This format meant they barely needed to show the monster, and sometimes didn't even need a monster at all — one story uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGas">Deadly Gas</a>, and another uses torrents of white foam.
</li><li> In-universe, the Third Doctor spent most of his tenure confined to Earth because the Time Lords disabled his TARDIS, and UNIT recruited him as their Scientific Advisor; in reality, though, it was because BBC slashed the show's budget, and the producers didn't have the money to convincingly depict alien worlds quite so often. Notably, this influenced the development of two memorable alien races that were introduced during the Pertwee era: the Autons (who were written to look like plastic mannequins so that they didn't require expensive prosthetics) and the Silurians (who were written as humanity's reptilian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Precursors</a> so that they could appear in stories set on Earth).

There was limited filming time, and the director had no experience with action scenes, and there was no money for a stunt co-ordinator in the budget. The resulting footage of Blackadder, George, Baldrick and Darling charging through No Man's Land while shells blew up around them looked distinctly underwhelming (they just fell over and lay on the ground looking not very dead), but the explosion effects were also so terrifying for the actors that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RowanAtkinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RowanAtkinson">Rowan Atkinson</a> refused point-blank to do any retakes. The footage was deemed unusable, but while the film editor was cycling through it and trying to figure out what to do, he realized that slowing it down made it far more effective. As a result, they re-edited the footage, slowed it down, dropped the audio out and replaced it with the theme music played as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyPianoPiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyPianoPiece">Lonely Piano Piece</a>, and then at the moment, a large explosion obscured the actors from view, crossfaded to a still photograph of some poppies.

</li><li> Things smoothed out considerably after the producers took a leap of faith after three years and rebranded the show as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersZeo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersZeo">Power Rangers Zeo</a></em> and started using new costumes and stock footage from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChourikiSentaiOhranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChourikiSentaiOhranger">Chouriki Sentai Ohranger</a></em>. The tradition of annually rebranding <em>Power Rangers</em> and giving the Rangers new costumes is well-established today, but it was considered a pretty big risk in 1996 since it meant abandoning the phenomenally successful formula that was the original <em>Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</em>.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersZeo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersZeo">Power Rangers Zeo</a></em> began its run, using stock footage from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChourikiSentaiOhranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChourikiSentaiOhranger">Chouriki Sentai Ohranger</a></em> for the battle sequences, the producers ran into a new problem. After putting so much effort into keeping the Rangers at six members so that they could keep the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter">Breakout Character</a> Tommy as part of the team (see above), now they had to bring the team back down to five members since <em>Ohranger</em> began with just five Rangers. This led to Billy the Blue Ranger—the only remaining member of the original five Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers—voluntarily retiring from active Ranger duty to become the team's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a> and tech support, with the explanation that the mystical Zeo crystal only had enough energy to power five Rangers. It was an unavoidable difficulty, but it went a long way towards making <em>Zeo</em> feel like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfAnEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfAnEra">End of an Era</a>. Tellingly, when <em>Zeo</em> eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack">brought back</a> Jason as the Gold Ranger (the second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Sixth Ranger</a> in the franchise's history), they actually bothered to write him out before the season finale so that they wouldn't run into the same problem in the next season.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLostGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLostGalaxy">Power Rangers Lost Galaxy</a></em>, Valerie Vernon was diagnosed with leukemia and had to leave the show. Since the premise gave limited opportunities to have her character Kendrix the Pink Ranger <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> (it was set on a space colony), they decided to have her go out in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>, leading to one of the few instances in the history of the show where a Ranger or one of their allies is killed in action. In turn, casting her replacement had its own effects on the plot; when plans to bring back the previous season's Pink Ranger fell through, they instead had last season's redeemed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> return as the new Pink Ranger and go through a redemption arc.
</li><li> The reliance on Sentai footage affected <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTimeForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTimeForce">Power Rangers Time Force</a></em> in a more negative way. It was originally planned to involve a lot more time travel, with the rangers jumping to different locations and time periods in different episodes. However they then realised that every single Giant Monster vs Megazord fight in the series was set within the same city and landscape, which severely limited the locations they could have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> appear in. This then led to the infamous intro with plenty of shots of different eras and dress styles being an outright lie, as most of this came from a single episode that was set in a movie studio, with that week's monster being a reality-warping director that sent each ranger to a different movie scene.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai">Power Rangers Samurai</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EkaDarville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EkaDarville">Eka Darville</a> had joined a union since his stint as Ranger Red in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM">Power Rangers RPM</a></em>. The producers circumvented this issue by having Ranger Red appear in morphed form, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">handwaving</a> an excuse for why he prefers to not unmorph and had Eka Darville provide voice-over work under a pseudonym. This played perfectly into the plot of the Samurai team being distrusful of him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMegaforce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMegaforce">Power Rangers Megaforce</a></em> was set to be the franchise's 20th anniversary, and Super Sentai had just recently celebrated its own 35th anniversary with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KaizokuSentaiGokaiger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KaizokuSentaiGokaiger">Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger</a></em>. However, the contract Saban had signed with Toei stipulated that they had to adapt every Sentai series in sequence<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10vfgt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10vfgt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10vfgt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Seasons 2 and 3 of <em>Mighty Morphin</em> used some costumes and elements from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoseiSentaiDairanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoseiSentaiDairanger">Gosei Sentai Dairanger</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NinjaSentaiKakuranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NinjaSentaiKakuranger">Ninja Sentai Kakuranger</a></em>, but the lion's share of their footage was skipped entirely</span>, so they had to go through <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TensouSentaiGoseiger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TensouSentaiGoseiger">Tensou Sentai Goseiger</a></em> before they could touch <em>Gokaiger</em>. On the other hand, their contract with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a> stipulated that each series had to be divided into two separate seasons of 20 episodes each. Saban used these two restrictions in concert by adapting <strong>both</strong> <em>Goseiger</em> and <em>Gokaiger</em> in the same series, using the split-season format to justify bringing in new costumes, villains, and a plotline designed to allow for veteran Rangers to cameo.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM">Power Rangers RPM</a></em> differed from its source material <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EngineSentaiGoonger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EngineSentaiGoonger">Engine Sentai Goonger</a></em> in a number of ways, most prominently by having its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Venjix be a sentient computer virus<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note112pwu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note112pwu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note112pwu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Whereas <em>Go-Onger</em>'s villains were mechanical aliens who fed on pollution</span>; the season also ended with the implication that Venjix survived the final battle by downloading himself into the Red Ranger's morpher. Most fans assumed this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a> would never be resolved (in part due to the franchise changing ownership twice), but when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TokumeiSentaiGobusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TokumeiSentaiGobusters">Tokumei Sentai Go-Busters</a></em> likewise featured a villainous computer virus, the writers seized the opportunity and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter">had "Evox" turn out to be Venjix in a new form</a>, which not only resolved the dangling plot thread but also helped tie the season more tightly to previous shows, even bringing <em>RPM</em>'s mentor Doctor K in the final arc and help the Beast Morphers team defeat their common enemy once and for all.
</li></ul></li><li> The 13-episode live-action TV series about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoomins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoomins">The Moomins</a> has the overarching plot of the king deciding that the Moomins' bohemian lifestyle doesn't fit in a modern welfare state and that they, as an "ethnic minority" need to be integrated into "normal" society. The most startling change is that he decides their noses are too big and orders them off — which leads to one of the most memorable (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuelish</a>) aspects of this series, namely that the actors in the Moomin suits take off the overdimensioned Moomin heads/masks they're wearing, revealing their normal human heads underneath. This is not only what the series is remembered for today but is also a pretty effective demonstration of how the Moomins' individuality is threatened by the integration process... but really, the reason behind is probably just as much that the Moomin heads were big, awkward and difficult to deal with on the set — it's <em>extremely</em> clear that the actors can barely see when wearing them, leading to a lot of clumsiness and fumbling around. Removing the heads allowed the actors to move about much more freely.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em> had the commander of the space station, Jeffrey Sinclair, played by Michael O'Hare, permanently replaced by John Sheridan at the beginning of the second season. This made some important overall changes to the overarching plot of the show since Sheridan had a very different personality and background. Originally it was hinted that this had been planned all along, but after O'Hare's death, it was revealed that during the course of the season he had been suffering from increasingly severe mental illness, which finally made it impossible for him to continue working.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodiedTrope">Parodied</a> in an episode of Israeli sitcom <em>HaPijamot</em>, elaborating several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf">What If?</a> cases. At the end of the episode, they show the story that would have happened if we had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget">No Budget</a>, showing Asian work immigrants playing the eponymous band, and the story that would have happened if we had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget">No Budget</a> at all, showing the set with no actors.
</li><li> Originally, the puzzle board for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune">Wheel of Fortune</a></em> was intended to be entirely automatic, much like the board on the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Concentration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Concentration">Concentration</a></em>. However, the set designers didn't have time to finish building it before they started taping the pilot, so the board was altered to have each letter be turned manually by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovelyAssistant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovelyAssistant">Lovely Assistant</a> (originally Susan Stafford from 1975-82, then the far more iconic Vanna White from 1982 onward). The mechanical board was replaced with a set of monitors in 1997, but White stayed.
</li><li> The creators of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lewis">Lewis</a></em> created a new pathologist character for the new series. However, then they decided they needed one more character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InspectorMorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InspectorMorse">Inspector Morse</a></em> to tie the continuity together — and it turned out that the only regular actor from <em>Morse</em> who wasn't dead, retired, or just plain unavailable was one Clare Holman, who had played pathologist Dr. Laura Hobson. The new pathologist character was summarily scrapped, her lines from the pilot were given to Hobson, and we got nine more years (and a delightful Lewis/Hobson romance) out of the delightfully snarky and levelheaded Laura. Nobody is sorry about this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCrystalMaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCrystalMaze">The Crystal Maze</a></em> was intended to be a version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FortBoyard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FortBoyard">Fort Boyard</a></em> for the UK. When the fort proved unavailable, Channel 4 asked their set designer if he could construct a similar setting. He replied he could, but it would be just as easy to have multiple zones with different themes. They liked the idea.
</li><li> Some of the production staff of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing">The West Wing</a></em> have claimed that the show's ending was rewritten due to the sudden death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnSpencer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnSpencer">John Spencer</a> (Leo McGarry), although series creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AaronSorkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AaronSorkin">Aaron Sorkin</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodNeverSaidThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodNeverSaidThat">has disputed this</a>. Supposedly, the final season's presidential election storyline was originally going to end with Arnold Vinick winning—but when Spencer's death forced the writers to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharacterDiedWithHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharacterDiedWithHim">kill off Leo</a> (who was Matthew Santos' running mate), they decided to have Santos win instead, since it would have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">much too depressing</a> for Santos to lose both Leo and the election.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a>'s "Have a Cigar" has a guest singer because both Roger Waters (who had blown his voice recording "Shine On You Crazy Diamond") and David Gilmour didn't like their own takes, so they invited Roy Harper, who was recording in the same studio.
</li><li> Brazilian musician Tim Maia and his band were rehearsing tracks for a new album. Unfortunately, a nearby construction site was making a lot of noise. Their solution: rewrite the tempos so they'd match the pounding of the construction's machinery.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PepeDeluxe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PepeDeluxe">Pepe Deluxé</a>, for their third album, <em>Spare Time Machine</em>, wrote the song "In the Cave" specifically to be performed on the Great Stalacpipe Organ. At the time, said organ was unavailable because it was under repair, so PD decided to delay the recording of "In the Cave", work the song into their next album, and just release <em>Spare Time Machine</em> as it was. The next album was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/QueenOfTheWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/QueenOfTheWave">Queen of the Wave</a></em>, and "In the Cave" wound up dovetailing perfectly with the story of that album.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Starflyer59" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Starflyer59">Starflyer 59</a>'s original, melancholic sound was not actually frontman Jason Martin's first choice for a musical style; he wanted to do faster, punk-influenced music. What made Jason slow everything down was the fact that he couldn't sing fast enough for the music he wanted to play.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> examples:
<ul><li> The boys had a problem with the recording of "A Day in the Life". The transition between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a>'s parts of the song was initially left blank because they couldn't think of a way to change from one to the other, consisting mainly of a bar count and Mal Evans triggering an alarm clock to mark the beginning of Paul's section. Eventually, they settled on the now-iconic noisy orchestral glissando, but they were unable to remove the alarm clock from the song, and ultimately decided to leave it in. Considering that Paul's section begins with "Woke up, fell out of bed", that ringing alarm clock fits in perfectly.
</li><li> It wasn't looking good for "Strawberry Fields Forever" making it to record at first. They had recorded two versions, in a different key and tempo, but while promising neither was quite the sound they were hoping for. Then George Martin discovered by accident that if one take was slowed down, it wound up in the same key and tempo as the other one. They were able to mix between the two takes and create the song we know and love today.
</li><li> Lennon was drunkenly playing around with the master tape for "Rain" when he decided to play it backward. However, he got confused and only got a portion of it backward. Everyone liked the way that sounded, however, and it was the first use of backward recordings in rock history.
</li><li> Generally speaking, as a band recording in a studio that even by the standards of 1960s technology, was not as advanced as either their peers in England or <em>especially</em> in America <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12eozn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12eozn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12eozn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Abbey Road Studios was using three- and four-track machines even as recently as early-1968, while many Americans studios had been using eight-track for years and were about to advance to 16-track; The Beatles still felt a sense of loyalty and respect to the EMI staff and loved the room they were recording in too much to leave</span> and were frustrated that, for example, the American-recorded records they loved had far punchier rhythm tracks than the Beatles' records. To compensate, they convinced the Abbey Road staff to muffle Ringo's drum kit and pump up the drums and Paul's Rickenbacker bass guitar with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoudnessWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoudnessWar">unprecedented levels of compression and limitation</a> by the 1966<em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Revolver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Revolver">Revolver</a></em> sessions. This sound (and experimentation with Paul's melodic bass playing and Ringo's tom-tom-heavy drumming techniques) proved very influential and paved the way for how bass and drums were recorded even in American studios (as well as The Beatles' music from then on).
</li><li> The folksy, rootsy, acoustical feel of many of the songs which made up <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWhiteAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWhiteAlbum">The White Album</a></em> might have much to do with the fact that many of the songs were written by the band members while on a spiritual retreat in Rishikesh, India, written on the acoustic guitars they brought with them. "Dear Prudence" and "Julia" in particular came from lessons in fingerpicking guitar that fellow retreater <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Donovan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Donovan">Donovan</a> taught John Lennon during their stay, and another traveling companion, Mike Love of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys">The Beach Boys</a>, helped Paul write the Beach Boys <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody">Affectionate Parody</a> "Back In The U.S.S.R.".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr">Ringo Starr's</a> drumming style was partially to do with the fact that he was a left-handed musician playing on a right-handed kit. This resulted in Ringo's "funny fills", as he was unable to get around the drums in a conventional way, always starting in the "wrong place" (usually from floor tom to overhead toms, instead of the other way around. He also disliked drum solos (although he obliged a short one in "The End" at Paul's request), preferring to play in the service of the song and as part of an ensemble.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithUrban" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithUrban">Keith Urban</a> is apparently having a track record for this regarding lead singles:
<ul><li> 2013's "Little Bit of Everything" has two examples. The opening riff is played on a ukulele because Urban heard producer Nathan Chapman playing one and asked if he could include it in the song. They also "stuttered" the ukulele riff at Urban's suggestion to mix things up. Also, the bass line is played on synth bass because the first two session bassists that Urban and Chapman contacted were unavailable.
</li><li> On 2015's "John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16", Urban played the bass line himself because he was having a hard time getting the scratch track to sound right on acoustic guitar. His original intent was to have the bass line replaced with a session musician, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentPlaceholder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentPlaceholder">it remained in the song</a> because he grew to like how it sounded.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Genesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Genesis">Genesis</a> examples:
<ul><li> The band developed many of the keyboard and bass guitar techniques and tones that came to define them in the early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">1970s</a> such as Mike Rutherford's use of fuzz bass and bass pedals, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TonyBanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TonyBanks">Tony Banks</a>' use of distorted electric piano and hand-over-hand fingering technique (as used in the beginning of "The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway" ) in the period between the departure of founding lead guitarist Anthony Phillips and the hiring of his replacement, Steve Hackett, as Banks, Rutherford, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterGabriel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterGabriel">Peter Gabriel</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilCollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilCollins">Phil Collins</a> often rehearsed many of the pieces later featured in <em>Nursery Cryme</em> as a bass/drums/keyboards/vocals quartet without an official lead guitarist to fill the traditional role. Even after Hackett's hiring, Rutherford and Banks continued to use these tones and techniques to fill out much of the sound of the band, while Hackett often opted for a textural, subtle approach that blended in the background (almost like a synthesizer at times), at least apart from instances where he was given space to solo or shine. This may also account for the tight musical camaraderie and confidence that the Banks/Collins/Rutherford trio developed when reduced to a trio.
</li><li> Also, as they played bigger venues and audiences by 1970-72, where the PA systems weren't always the best, there was dead air in between many songs as the band spent long periods of time setting their guitars to alternate tunings, loading sounds into (or fixing) the Mellotron and other instruments, and setting up and disassembling props and set pieces. Gabriel also noted, to his consternation, that there were often four musicians onstage either surrounded by equipment or inadvertently looking down at their instruments or effects pedals (often sitting down and/or in shadow) hardly acknowledging the audience in front of them. Gabriel began filling the spaces by telling deadpan, weird, non-sequitur, often unrelated sci-fi or fantasy stories (or surreal comedy sketches with ex-child actor Phil) to keep the audience involved, which led to using masks, costumes and props to illustrate the complex lyrics. The costumes, masks, props, and stories also helped create an image, dry humor and mystique around the band and gave them a shock factor, which led to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity">much publicity and attention they might not have gotten otherwise</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who</a>'s Pete Townshend developed his signature guitar-smashing quite by accident one night when he was frustrated with the low ceiling at the venue they were playing at.
</li><li> One of the most popular songs in history, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a> collaboration "Under Pressure", came into existence only due to an impromptu jam session after Bowie decided to drop in on Queen while they were recording the album "Hot Space".
</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a> was recording <em>Straight Outta Lynwood</em>, he wanted the lead single to be a parody of James Blunt's "You're Beautiful", as he liked the contrast between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangstaRap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangstaRap">Gangsta Rap</a>-inspired title and cover of <em>Straight Outta Lynwood</em>, and the soft, romantic ballad of "You're Beautiful". When Atlantic Records refused to let him include the parody, he was forced to write a new one to replace it, and came up with "White And Nerdy", a parody of Chamillionaire's "Ridin'". Suddenly the gangsta rap aesthetic was a perfect fit - and both album and single became Yankovic's most commercially successful up to that point.
</li><li> In a non-technological side, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKinks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKinks">The Kinks</a> were, like the Beatles, the Who, etc. a burgeoning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishInvasion">British Invasion</a> rock band conquering America and the pop charts. However, the band members' intergroup fighting and squabbles onstage did not sit well with the American Musicians' Union, who in 1965 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">barred them from appearing on stage in America</a> for five years. Faced with physically being prohibited from witnessing American culture or being able to fully promote their music "across the pond", the band deliberately developed a more Anglocentric image and style, concentrating on England, English subject matter and vocabulary, which would influence musicians from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock">Progressive Rock</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Britpop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Britpop">Britpop</a> to abandon American influences and Americanization and embrace their own roots and identity.
<ul><li> Similarly, they may have lent to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a> retaining a very American identity, sound, and influence during his career, as the visa troubles his lifetime manager "Colonel Tom" Parker went through prevented Elvis from being able to tour or travel outside of America (aside from Elvis' stay in Germany when he joined the Army). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> had to meet him by their being invited to Graceland in 1965.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoniMitchell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoniMitchell">Joni Mitchell</a> contracted polio at age nine, and while recovering from polio took up singing, guitar playing and painting (not to mention smoking) through her childhood partly as physical therapy while trying to recover. Due to a weakened hand, she developed alternate tunings to comfortably play guitar, which in turn helped to characterize her sound.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MariahCarey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MariahCarey">Mariah Carey</a>'s duet with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BoyzIIMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BoyzIIMen">Boyz II Men</a>, "One Sweet Day", was recorded while she and the boys were both at the peak of their fame, and they knew it'd be impossible to get their schedules on the same page again to film a proper music video at a later date. So instead, they <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXxRyNvTPr8">filmed the recording session and used that as the video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. This ultimately worked in their favor. Not only was the song a huge hit, spending 16 weeks at #1, but critics praised the simple video for pairing well with the song's selfless message. Since then, filming the recording session (or making the video <em>look</em> like a recording session) has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">become a popular go-to</a> for more serious songs, conveying the message that the artist is at their most stripped-down and real.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToniBraxton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToniBraxton">Toni Braxton</a>'s big break came when she was asked to sing a demo version of "Love Shoulda Brought You Home", intended for Anita Baker for the soundtrack to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieMurphy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieMurphy">Eddie Murphy</a> film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Boomerang1992" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Boomerang1992">Boomerang (1992)</a></em>. However, Baker was pregnant at the time and on hiatus from performing, so she suggested they just go with Braxton's version. It became her debut single and a star was born.
</li><li> On the day <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanMorrison">Van Morrison</a> was supposed to have his photo taken for the cover of <em>Moondance</em>, he had developed a large pimple on his forehead — the photographer, therefore, used a series of closeup shots where his forehead was out of frame entirely.

<ul><li> In 1993, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SMW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SMW">SMW</a> entered a partnership that was to include an angle where the former would be invaded by the later. However, WCW's executives were so offended by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTalk">trash talk</a> used by the Smokey Mountain owner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimCornette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimCornette">Jim Cornette</a> that they abrogated the deal before the angle could take hold. Around the same time the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UniversalWrestlingFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UniversalWrestlingFederation">UWFi</a> invasion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling">NJPW</a> became one of the most financially successful feuds of all time(<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">at UWFi</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorKiller">expense</a>), which meant WCW <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">was ready to try the invasion angle again in 1996</a>. By then Smokey Mountain Wrestling had closed down though, so rather than find another promotion WCW simply had three men attempt a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostileShowTakeover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostileShowTakeover">hostile show takeover</a> instead, resulting in one of the most imitated pro wrestling angles of all time, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewWorldorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewWorldorder">nWo</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a></em>, one of the most infamous botches was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista">Batista</a>'s mutual elimination at the 2005 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble">Royal Rumble</a>. Batista was intended to win cleanly, but he wound up losing balance, sending both men toppling over the top rope and hitting the ground simultaneously. Because of a recent brand split, the referees for Smackdown declared Cena the winner, while Raw's refs sided with Batista, keeping the fans placated while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> stormed down the ramp to restart their portion of the bout.
</li><li> After being told by a promoter that there could only be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmurfettePrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmurfettePrinciple">one women's match a card</a>, Monterrey area businessman Luciano García decided to start a Lucha Libre enterprise with cards featuring nothing but women's matches. Luchadoras were in short supply due to the fact established promoters were actively blocking them from working for his new promotion, leading García to look North of the border for talent and promote several international bouts between competitors from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternationalShowdownByProxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternationalShowdownByProxy">Mexico, USA, and Canada.</a> While Lucha Libre Femenil would eventually kick its foreign dependence through healthy relationships with other area enterprises it won over, local rosters full of new luchadoras who could stand on their own, booking luchadoras from all around Mexico and coverage from TV Azteca, the occasional Canada\USA vs match had become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause">tradition</a>.
</li><li> The Puroresu Love Period of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanProWrestling">All Japan Pro Wrestling</a> came about due to the fact the highly successful style of booking pioneered by Giant Baba became impractical to them when it was taken up by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ProWrestlingNOAH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ProWrestlingNOAH">Pro Wrestling NOAH</a>, who had also taken most of All Japan's roster when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MitsuharuMisawa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MitsuharuMisawa">Mitsuharu Misawa</a> formed it, along with All Japan's television spot, causing AJPW's focus to turn less to impressing the purest fans who would rather watch NOAH anyway and more towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">corporate sponsors</a>. For the record, it worked, but when the earliest opportunity came, which happened to be the corporate wing becoming a pain to deal with coincidentally coinciding with NOAH's decline, Jun Akiyama was happy to take All Japan back to its roots.

Whatever the cons, ROH no longer needed to sell other promotion's products after they were purchased by Sinclair Broadcast Group and SHIMMER was no longer sharing profits on DVD sales, which saw the collaboration between the two decreasing <em>significantly</em>.

Between a thirty-minute time slot that was further reduced by MTV's need for a musical guest and working against executives who were more interested in stunts and explosions than wrestling, the wrestlers basically needed to do everything they could as quickly as they could.

<ul><li> James Naismith, a physical education professor at International Young Men's Christian Association Training School (the YMCA today) was looking for a pair of boxes for the game that he had just recently invented. When he asked a worker at the Y for some boxes, he was told that they didn't have any, but he did have some old peach baskets lying around that could be of some use. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Basketball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Basketball">The rest is history.</a>
<ul><li> A few years later in 1930 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Uruguay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Uruguay">Montevideo</a>, YMCA teacher wanted to play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">football</a> but he only had the YMCA's basketball court. So he invented a way to play Football indoor, adapted the rules for the new space and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futsal">Futsal<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> would become one the most played sports in South America and then the world.
</li></ul></li><li> American football:
<ul><li> Some historians believe the rule to stop the clock on an incomplete forward pass in American football came because, in the early days of the sport, games had only one ball and an old man for the official, necessitating the stoppage while the ball was retrieved.
</li><li> For the longest time in the NFL, the goals were on the goal line rather than the end line. This was supposedly done when the championship game was moved to an indoor arena one year and there wasn't enough space to put the goals on the end lines.
</li><li> The famed West Coast offense came about because Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Greg Cook tore his rotator cuff in his rookie year and was unable to play after. Desperate, the team traded for Virgil Carter, a quarterback with limited arm strength but good accuracy, and then-quarterbacks coach Bill Walsh was tasked with designing an offense that could get the most out of him. Thus, Walsh modified the vertical offense he'd learned with the Raiders to emphasize short passes and horizontal routes, and thus the West Coast offense got its start.
</li></ul></li><li> The baseball rule that the first two foul balls are strikes came about at least in part because the supply of balls was limited and the balls were not as tough as they have become since, so by the end of the game the balls were often battered into irregular shapes, to the delight of hitters and the consternation of pitchers.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13en28');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13en28" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13en28');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Of course, even with an unlimited supply of high-quality balls, a batter could just work a pitcher to death by fouling away until he got pitches he liked.</span>
</li><li> The reason why ice hockey games have three periods of twenty minutes is that the old format (two halves of thirty minutes) caused the ice to become so rutted and snowy from the players' prolonged skating that it negatively impacted puck play in the final minutes of the half. Changing the game to three periods gave the maintenance crew a second chance to clean up the ice and ensure consistent play.

<ul><li> Due to difficulties with getting the microphone to work, the costume designers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ThePhantomOfTheOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ThePhantomOfTheOpera">The Phantom of the Opera</a></em> redesigned the mask from the full-face mask described in the book to a mask that covered up only half the actor's face. The resulting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FashionableAsymmetry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FashionableAsymmetry">Fashionable Asymmetry</a> has become the iconic design for the character, and leaked into just about every piece of media involving the Phantom. (This is also why the play's advertisement materials depict a very different-looking mask design.)
</li><li> The Classical Unities, a concept supposedly created by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristotle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, was nigh-on ubiquitous in theatrical discussion until the 1800s—according to its proponents, Aristotle claimed that all dramatic plays should focus on a singular plot thread, keep the story confined to a single place, and resolve the plot within a day. Its proponents argued that by limiting the action to a small scope, this created a true reflection of reality, without the narrative needing to jump around or distract the viewer—and for centuries, a play that did not follow the Unities was seen as a failure on the part of the playwright. Part of the reason it became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope">Discredited Trope</a>, and swiftly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenTrope">Forgotten Trope</a> as well, was that other historians realized that Aristotle was actually talking about this trope; it was never actually a rule so much as a budget limitation that forced many playwrights to keep the action relatively low-key, as opposed to epic poems that didn't suffer those limitations.

<ul><li> One thing that's noticeable about the various B&amp;M versions of Batman: The Ride is just how compact the ride layout is. This is because the original version at Six Flags Great America was replacing Tidal Wave, an Anton Schwarzkopf shuttle loop coaster, and had to be specifically designed to fit into the long and very skinny footprint of Tidal Wave's space in Yankee Harbor.
</li><li> The original Superman: Ultimate Flight at Six Flags Over Georgia features tunnels and was designed to take advantage of the hilly terrain. This layout would be reused for the clones at Six Flags Great America and Six Flags Great Adventure that opened the following year, but those two don't feature the near misses with the terrain that the Georgia version has because they were built on old parking lot areas.

"America Sings" (a musical attraction featuring American folk songs) had a whole section featuring anthropomorphic animals dressed like stereotypical Southerners and singing traditional songs from the American South. By a complete coincidence, one of them was a female possum who looked identical to one who appeared in a musical number in <em>Song of the South</em>—which (rather conveniently) also featured animated anthropomorphic animals in the American South. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14pqt0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note14pqt0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14pqt0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> It may have helped that Splash Mountain was originally built in 1989, when <em>Song of the South</em> wasn't <strong>quite</strong> as controversial as it is today.</span>

<ul><li> The Unreal Engine would not have been able to handle a fully rendered city with 2000 technology, forcing the creators to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatelessGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatelessGhetto">boxed-in sections</a> in the New York levels with a justification that due to high crime rates, authorities have walled in ghettos and other undesirable areas. In Paris, the boxed-in city is justified with the nation being on lock-down due to terrorist attacks.
</li><li> A very eerie example was the lack of the World Trade Center in the New York Skyline. Due to memory limitations, the sections of the skybox including the World Trade Center had to be removed, and the creators justified it saying that they had been destroyed in a terrorist attack before the game started. Keep in the mind that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight">the game came out in 2000.</a></em> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15gjsg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15gjsg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15gjsg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It's not <em>that</em> prescient, mind — people forget this because 9/11 eclipsed it, but Al Qaeda operatives had already attempted to bring the World Trade Center down with a truck bomb in 1993.</span>

The maps are bigger than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx">Deus Ex</a>'s were since the mod was designed with the thought that it would be run on more powerful computers, but you can see why the boxed-in method was needed if you "noclip" yourself away from the map and try to view it all at once.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiscoElysium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiscoElysium">Disco Elysium</a></em> skills were originally intended to be represented with icons, but the game's concept artist quit before that could be finished, so that job fell to the art director, who is far better at drawing humans and thus made fantastical portraits instead. This eventually led to the skills exhibiting separate personalities and arguing with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> and each other, turning them into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfPersonifications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfPersonifications">Cast of Personifications</a> in their own right, which has become the defining feature of the game.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dizzy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dizzy">Dizzy</a></em> game made use of an engine for rotating sprites in real time, allowing the hero to roll and tumble. However, the engine worked best on simple shapes, such as circles - and thus, Dizzy became an egg.
<ul><li> <em>Seymour Goes to Hollywood</em> was envisioned as <em>Movieland Dizzy</em>, but the creators felt the real-world setting was too far removed from the fantasy settings of the <em>Dizzy</em> games. So with 12 weeks to go until release, the character was given a more distinctive design, thus giving birth to Seymour.
</li></ul></li><li> According to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2019/4/9/18300753/earth-defense-force-iron-rain-history">an interview<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with the developers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthDefenseForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthDefenseForce">Earth Defense Force</a></em>, the reason oversized ants are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoomba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoomba">the basic fodder enemy of the franchise</a> is because the original game's extremely short development (4 months to make the actual game, 2 for debugging) meant there was no time to create original characters.
<div class="indent"><strong>Masatsugu Igarashi:</strong> Basically within four months theres no time to design original characters, so you take something that exists around you everywhere. We picked up reference images from books and used them to create the enemies.
</div></li><li> Fog in video games is usually done because of the difficulty — or even impossibility — of rendering an entire area all at once. In order to make up for the limitation, the developers will usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> it in some way. Some examples:
<ul><li> A well-executed and well-received case: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SilentHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SilentHill">Silent Hill</a></em>'s fog helps the game's atmosphere so much that the fog (or sometimes snow) was retained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact">long after technical improvements had obviated the need for it</a>.
<ul><li> Tellingly, an HD re-release of the original games drastically increased the draw distance... and was considered the vastly inferior version because of it, to the point where the fog was <em>patched back in for the PS3 version.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> uses the fog as a major plot point. The sequel got around it by having all the rooftop levels at night or dawn.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII">Grand Theft Auto III</a></em> has heavy fog that just adds to the overall aesthetic of "crappy New York-esque city".
</li><li> The gas zombies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising2">Dead Rising 2</a></em> are accompanied by green fog because it makes it easier to render the increased amounts of zombies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Superman64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Superman64">Superman 64</a></em> has green "kryptonite fog" which allegedly explains why Superman isn't so super-powered in Lex Luthor's virtual world.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SanFranciscoRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SanFranciscoRush">San Francisco Rush</a></em>...well, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanFrancisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanFrancisco">San Francisco</a>. It makes a little less sense in <em>Rush 2: Extreme Racing USA</em>, which features various US cities, although the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles">Los Angeles</a> course changes the fog to <em>smog</em> instead, reflecting LA's notoriously poor air quality.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> was originally supposed to be a car racing game. But attempts at making the AI opponents more challenging resulted in the AI chasing after the player and crashing into them. Thinking that this was cool, the programmers retooled the game into a madcap crime simulator that spawned a mega-franchise.
</li><li> One level of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a></em> tasks you with infiltrating the Covenant starship <em>Truth and Reconciliation</em> to rescue human prisoners. Originally, this would have involved walking from the initial desert area of the level onto the ship by way of a ramp. But the team found that having both the desert area and the detailed ship rendered together in one continuous level would've been too much for the hardware. So they separated the two into two instanced areas, with the ship as seen from the desert being shown from a distance at night and its interior only being accessible by way of a "Gravity Lift" that pulls people up from the surface. The Gravity Lift would go on to be a common feature of Covenant structures in later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> games, whether for other spacecraft or their turret towers.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tenchu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tenchu">Tenchu</a></em> games take place at night because it was easier on the PlayStation's processor.
</li><li> As indicated above, multiple disc games often make certain areas inaccessible after certain points in the plot, to save on space on each disc. Each disc usually has some big event occur at the end of the disc that will remove access to certain side areas that are no longer useful to the plot in the next disc. It's annoying if you needed a certain item for a side quest, but allowing the developers to not have to try and fit the entire world and everything in it on the last disc, freeing them up some space for ending cutscenes, boss data, and the very definite final dungeon.
</li><li> The reason <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal">Portal</a></em> takes place in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse">Shared Universe</a> with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em> series is because the game had a small development team, so it originally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWorkRecycledGraphics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWorkRecycledGraphics">reused most of its assets</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em>. The final game uses mostly original assets, but still has some from <em>Half-Life 2</em>, such as the High Energy Pellets, which look and sound the same as the Combine's energy orbs.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong">Donkey Kong</a></em> owes its existence to this trope <em>three-fold</em>:
<ul><li> The original arcade game had a chubby, mustachioed Mario (then known as Jumpman) wearing a hat and overalls due to technical limitations. The technology at the time would not have been able to show Mario's hair sticking up when he fell, a mustache would be easier to show than a mouth at that resolution, overalls were the only piece of clothing that could also be seen with 1981 graphics, and only square hit boxes were possible. These same traits would later come to benefit Mario again in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64">Nintendo 64</a> outings, which have aged considerably better than other early 3D games as a result.
</li><li> The game also owes its mere existence to serendipity. In 1980, Nintendo attempted to release their latest arcade hit, a game called <em>Radar Scope</em> in the United States; however, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericansHateTingle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericansHateTingle">the game was popular in Japan, it flopped hard in the United States</a>. Looking for a way to clear out their warehouse of returned and unsold <em>Radar Scope</em> machines, Nintendo looked to create a game that would run on the same hardware as <em>Radar Scope</em> so that the existing machines could be easily converted to run it, but would also be a surefire hit in America. The result was <em>Donkey Kong</em>.
</li><li> Notably too, the original <em>Donkey Kong</em> was intended to be a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popeye">Popeye</a></em> game. Partway through development they lost the license, however, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShigeruMiyamoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShigeruMiyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> turned the concepts they had into original properties with Bluto becoming Donkey Kong, Popeye becoming Jumpman, and Olive Oyl becoming Pauline. Since Nintendo got not one successful and beloved franchise from this but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Mario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Mario">two</a></em>, it's safe to assume this worked out monumentally well for them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>:
<ul><li> When the very first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros1">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> was nearing completion, the playtesters deemed the Koopa Troopas, originally intended to be the basic enemy type, to be too tricky to beat for earlier portions of the game. However, very little space was left to program anything else into the code. So they came up with a simply-designed walking mushroom that only had two frames of animation, which were actually flipped versions of the same image. At the same time, this creature's resemblance to the Super Mushroom required them to change the item's look and behavior. Thus, a last-minute attempt to squeeze in something to make the game fairer led to the creation of the iconic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoomba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoomba">Goomba</a>.
</li><li> The Fire Flower <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUp">Power-Up</a> launches bouncing fireballs because straight-flying fireballs were too impractical and hard to program otherwise.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecurringCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecurringCharacter">recurring character</a> Waluigi was created for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioTennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioTennis">Mario Tennis</a></em> so that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wario">Wario</a> could have a tennis partner—allowing him to play doubles with Mario and Luigi, Peach and Daisy, and Toad and Yoshi. This is also why he doesn't generally appear in the <em>Wario Land</em> games, or any games that don't involve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoKartingWithBowser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoKartingWithBowser">competitive team sports</a>. Amusingly, though, this hasn't stopped him from becoming a very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">memetic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">fan favorite</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the key traits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceInvaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceInvaders">Space Invaders</a></em> is how the aliens get faster as you destroy more and more of them. This was originally an unfortunate consequence of the low processing power being choked by a large number of enemies, but the creators liked it and decided to keep it in.
</li><li> Probably one of the reasons games that were set in space were probably so popular in the early days of video games was how easy they were on both the part of the developers and on the hardware they ran on. Black screen with occasional white dots is very easy to draw.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em>
<ul><li> Due to technical limitations, the early games had a loading screen for each area. The designers took advantage of this by making the loading screen the animation of a door opening. The door, in fact, that the player was entering through. As with <em>Silent Hill</em>'s fog, these became so linked with the series that, even when they were able to effectively eliminate loading times for the first game's GameCube remake, they kept the door scenes in anyway. At least once, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare">surprise attacks</a> were hidden in these same loading screens (most notably the infamous "door of death" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2">Resident Evil 2</a></em>). In <em>Resident Evil Code: Veronica X</em> the developers tried to manufacture this tension, with deliberately delayed door openings accompanied by thudding heartbeat sounds and throbbing rumble controllers.
</li><li> The infamous live-action opening and equally bad voice acting from the original 1996 game was the result of having a budget so tight that the developers couldn't afford to hire professional actors.

<ul><li> Like the Mario example above, much of Link's now-iconic appearance — his hat, tunic, and pointy ears — was simply a result of what could be easily rendered with the NES's 8-Bit graphics.

Their solution: Set the game in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarroUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarroUniverse">Bizarro Universe</a> of the previous game's setting, where most of the characters are counterparts of people from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em>, who look exactly the same (allowing the developers to reuse the models) but who often have radically different names and personalities. Furthermore, they were able to store a more complex world on a cartridge with barely more memory than <em>Ocarina of Time</em> by means of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">"Groundhog Day" Loop</a>; resetting everything in the game except the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon">Plot Coupons</a>, the masks, the songs, and the non-ammo items meant that there were far fewer variables that the game needed to keep track of between play sessions compared to its predecessor (this is also the reason that non-Japanese versions of <em>Majora's Mask</em> that <em>do</em> let you save in the middle of the 3-day cycle at the Owl Statues have two save slots instead of three).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a></em> had a somewhat rushed production that required the team to cut several dungeons they planned to include. This influenced the whole Nayru's Pearl arc of the game; turns out that Greatfish Isle, where the Pearl and the dungeon containing it would have been located, has been torn apart by Ganondorf by the time you reach it, and locating the Pearl requires you to instead explore the previously-visited Windfall and Outset Islands.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em> boasts a persistent world, but runs into the problem of having to remember which enemies Link has slain and resources he's collected, which ones he hasn't, and what items he's left around the world and where. To cover this, the devs came up with the "Blood Moon", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadMoonRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadMoonRising">Bad Moon Rising</a> that appears every few nights and explicitly respawns all monsters but in the background also affects all items laying around and overall reverts the world to its untouched state. If one picks up enough items or kills enough enemies, the game will actually do an instant Blood Moon regardless of the time of day.

Much later in the game, a database error that wiped out several days' progress for many players led to the introduction of a "Time Arc", in which portals through time started opening up throughout the kingdom.
<ul><li> And on the creative side, there's another example. KOL celebrates holidays both via the in-game calendar and the real-life one, which aren't synced. Occasionally, that means that two holidays are being celebrated on the same day. One year Arrbor Day (where pirates plant trees to get wood to repair their ships) happened on the same day as Halloween. This combination of pirates, trees, and spookiness resulted in a special zone: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">Shivering Timbers</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland">Monkey Island</a></em> games, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestJohnsDealership" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestJohnsDealership">Stan</a> has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnmovingPlaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnmovingPlaid">Unmoving Plaid</a> pattern due to technical reasons in the first game, but it has been kept, even after the series became full-3D (and it required extensive effort to replicate under the conditions) and becoming a plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfMonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfMonkeyIsland">Tales of Monkey Island</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause">simply because it is so iconic of Stan</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em>:
<ul><li> With <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metroid1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metroid1">Metroid 1</a></em>, the iconic Morph Ball came into being because the programmers had trouble making an animation of Samus crawling through small passageways. Thus, they made do with a much simpler animation of a rolling ball.
</li><li> The similarly-iconic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShouldersofDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShouldersofDoom">shoulders</a> came about in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidIIReturnOfSamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidIIReturnOfSamus">Metroid II: Return of Samus</a></em> because, it being a classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy">Game Boy</a> game, they couldn't use alternate colors to differentiate between the starting Power Suit and the Varia upgrade as they did in the first game. This look has essentially become her defining outfit, to the point that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion">Metroid Fusion</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidZeroMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidZeroMission">Metroid: Zero Mission</a></em> are the only games in the series that don't give the massive shoulders with the Varia upgrade or even give her that upgrade from the start. And said games even have reasons for doing so: the former because Samus's Fusion Suit is made up of remnants from her removed Power Suit and the latter because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Samus doesn't get the shoulders until she receives an ancient, but more advanced Power Suit towards the end of the game.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em>, like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em>, hides loading times behind the doors. The doors simply won't open until the next room is loaded. During normal gameplay, you usually won't notice this unless you listen to your Gamecube or Wii's disc drive suddenly spin up as you approach or shoot the door.
</li></ul></li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> was remade for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a> as <em>The Twin Snakes</em>, just about all of the dialogue was re-recorded, despite most of it being identical to the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> version (and it even uses all of the same actors to boot, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleReprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleReprise">courtesy of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidHayter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidHayter">David Hayter</a>.) While it would make sense insofar as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsAboutTimedHits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsAboutTimedHits">mentioning the different buttons and such</a>, Hayter mentioned in an interview that when the dialogue for the original was recorded, it was done in an apartment that was converted into a studio. If that was used for the remake, then the GameCube's sound card would pick up outside noises, including <em>traffic</em>.
<ul><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear1">Metal Gear 1</a></em> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MSX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MSX2">MSX2</a> was originally envisioned as a top-down shooter. However, the hardware limitations of the platform meant that too many sprites on the screen would start to make the picture flicker. The game was thus re-tooled to focus on <em>avoiding</em> enemies and combat, and an iconic stealth franchise was born.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox">Star Fox</a></em>'s iconic Arwing fighter design was conceived largely because it could be made out of relatively few polygons. In addition, the "fly into the screen" approach was used because of the SNES's strength at drawing 2D backgrounds, further conserving limited processing power. <a class="urllink" href="http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/3ds/starfox/0/1">Full details are provided in this Iwata Asks interview.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Most of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero">F-Zero</a></em>'s science-fiction elements were a consequence of technical limitations. The use of hovering vehicles came as solution for sprite artists to not waste time drawing wheels (which would require several more individual sprites for each vehicle) and the concept of sky-high floating courses was to justify a perspective trick of the SNES's Mode 7, which turned a background layer (in this case, consisting of the racetrack and the environment "below" it) into the course itself. Because of this, Nintendo did not have to program in actual background elements around the racetrack, only needing the illusion of a city or whatever being viewed from top-down.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>, none of the Qunari had horns although their race is supposed to have them. This was because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare">BioWare</a> didn't have the time to create alternate designs for all the helmets just so your Qunari party member could wear them, so they opted to not give him horns at all and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> it by saying that Qunari born without horns are considered to be destined for greatness, while those who choose to leave the Qun cut off their horns as a way of showing their rejection (all the other Qunari in the game).
<ul><li> Similarly, golems are supposed to be 10 feet tall and appear that way in cut scenes, but Shale, a golem you can recruit, is much smaller and explains that it used to be the same size as the others until a previous owner actually chiseled down its legs because it kept getting stuck in doors. This is something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentGag">Development Gag</a> since the meta reason for this was just that — the character model kept getting stuck in doorways, but in the story, it helps explain Shale's disdain for humans after being treated that way.
</li></ul></li><li> The miasma in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyCrystalChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyCrystalChronicles">Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles</a></em> is the driving force of the <em>entire game</em>, but it was originally just designed to keep the whole team on screen at all times. Your party has to carry around a chalice that wards the miasma in its radius, and leaving the ward causes you to take damage, so nobody can wander off, so split-screen isn't necessary, so everyone gets to enjoy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">Scenery Porn</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QBert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QBert">Q*bert</a></em> and his enemies were supposed to speak in full English. However, the Votrax speech synthesizer used made things sound almost unintelligible, so this was changed to a sort of alien language that gave Q*Bert his famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SymbolSwearing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SymbolSwearing">profanity</a>. The only distinguishable sounds are "bye-bye" when you get a game over and "Hello, I'm turned on" when the machine is powered up.
</li><li> The second game of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain">Legacy of Kain</a></em> series, <em>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver</em>, was much larger during development, which led to it being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">Obvious Beta</a>. Among other cut content, Raziel's final brother Turel would have been fought, the Human Citadel would have been non-optional and contained a hidden area where the vampire worshipping humans lurked, and the ending was entirely unambiguous, Raziel successfully killing Kain and then activating the Silenced Cathedral to destroy every Vampire in Nosgoth. Crystal Dynamics was running out of time and there was only so much room on the disk, so a lot of content was cut and left out to be included in future games. Ironically, this would lead to a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad">Tropes Are Not Bad</a> though, because the series would go on to have an amazingly complex <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot">Kudzu Plot</a> centering on Kain and Raziel's trips through time.
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia1">Prince of Persia</a></em>, the game developers wanted to add another character; however, space on the game floppy was limited, and a new character could only be created if it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">Palette Swap</a> of an existing one. After tinkering a bit, the development team came up with a dark copy of the Prince: the Shadow Prince. This later became central to the game's plot: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Shadow Prince is generated when the Prince passes through a magical mirror, and the Prince must rejoin his split self near the finale of the game.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3">Far Cry 3</a></em>, Hoyt Volker was supposed to be the sole main villain. Then Michael Mando auditioned for the minor character "Lupo". He didn't get the part but they were so impressed by the audition that they decided to scrap Lupo and create an entirely new character for Mando to play, one which took over all advertising and even the cover of the game, and is still agreed to be one of the best villains of the franchise: Vaas Montenegro.
</li><li> How the plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bioforge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bioforge">BioForge</a></em> came to be: you're a cyborg (so you don't need fluid lifelike animations) and, due to a disaster, the base you're in is almost completely abandoned (no large amounts of on-screen characters needed).
</li><li> The red and white colors of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Famicom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Famicom">Famicom</a> were due to those colors of plastic being the cheapest at the time.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://all-things-andy-gavin.com/2011/02/02/making-crash-bandicoot-part-1//">This series of blog posts<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by the creators of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a></em> describes how the limitations of the hardware of the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> dictated almost every design choice, from level design to character design to even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrateExpectations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrateExpectations">one of the mechanics the series is most known for</a> (which in turn named the character). Basically, Crash turned out the way it is because technology sucked at the time.
</li><li> After the smash success of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroTheDragon1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroTheDragon1998">Spyro the Dragon</a></em>, Insomniac Games was trying to come up with a plot for the foregone sequel. While looking at the Japanese box art for the first game, they noticed that the katakana for Spyro's name looked like it spelled out "Ripto". They now had the perfect name for the villain of their sequel, and thus <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spyro2RiptosRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spyro2RiptosRage">Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage!</a></em> was born.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoubleDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoubleDragon">Double Dragon</a></em> was originally conceived as a sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KunioKun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KunioKun">Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun</a></em>, but evolved into an original IP because the lead director (Yoshihisa Kishimoto) wanted to make a game that could be marketable in the west without having to spend time working on a second version for the foreign market as he did with <em>Renegade</em>.
</li><li> The reason why Little Mac was made so little in the NES version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut">Punch-Out!!</a></em> was to make it easier to see your opponent, as the developers couldn't translate the wireframe graphics from the arcade version properly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SystemShock2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SystemShock2">System Shock 2</a></em> was made when 3D graphics were in their infancy and computers simply didn't have the processing power to render very many characters at once, let alone make them look human. On the other hand, sound design was easy. The result was a terrifying haunted house of an abandoned spaceship where players spend most of their time <em>alone</em>, always on edge waiting for the next inhuman abomination to show up out of nowhere and attack them. And since there were no living characters around to give out the plot, Ken Levine instead created the Shock franchise's now-iconic audio logs.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rayman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rayman">Rayman</a> was given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FloatingLimbs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FloatingLimbs">Floating Limbs</a> because this saved animation time and disc space for other content on the limited hardware of the time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shinobi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shinobi">Shinobi</a></em> for the PS2 has the hero wearing an extremely long red scarf. This originally started with them goofing around with the parameters, and they set it to 200%. They realized this allowed the player to keep track of the character much better, so it was left like that.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars2">Super Robot Wars 2</a></em> was meant to have <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AuraBattlerDunbine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AuraBattlerDunbine">Aura Battler Dunbine</a></em> in, but Banpresto couldn't secure the rights to it. Rather than simply give up on the idea entirely, the company decided to create an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalGeneration">Original Generation</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> in the form of Masaki Andoh and the Cybuster. Since then, the number of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em> games that are devoid of original protagonists can be counted on one hand and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsGaiden">Masou Kishin</a> plot, in particular, is the longest one of them all, and still ongoing as well.
</li><li> The designers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Facade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Facade">Façade</a></em> admitted that they deliberately made Trip and Grace such self-centered, denial-prone people in order to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justify</a> and disguise some of the limitations of the AI. If the player says and does something the dev team didn't anticipate, Trip and Grace will choose to focus on their own needs instead, or just ignore the player's actions entirely.
</li><li> The game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NancyDrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NancyDrew">Nancy Drew</a>: The Curse of Blackmoor Manor</em> was rendered in still frames (and the occasional FMV), which made it difficult for NPCs to appear during actual gameplay. So they wrote it into the script that Ethel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthHiBye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthHiBye">appears out of nowhere</a> after Nancy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">leaves the East Hall</span>, spooking her. This scene was received favorably by players, who thought it heightened the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">scary</a> atmosphere.
</li><li> The protagonist of horror game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ClockTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ClockTower">Clock Tower</a></em> is a weaponless, vulnerable girl who must flee or outwit enemies instead of fighting them. The developer wrote her as such because of the <a class="urllink" href="http://whatsyourtagblog.com/2015/01/22/clock-tower-spiritual-successor-night-cry-coming-to-vita-mobile-possibly-pc-with-your-help/">self-admitted sexist<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> beliefs he held at the time. However, players reacted favorably to this new style of gameplay, as it heightened their fear and made for a deeper experience than other horror games of the era (which centered around shooting and/or hacking enemies to death). Today, <em>Clock Tower</em> is considered a forerunner of the <em>survival horror</em> genre-defining aspects of which are emphasis on flight-over-fight mechanics and the protagonists' helplessness.
</li><li> One reason why <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> features a cast predominantly composed of girls is because ZUN, whose art is already considered mediocre at best, is even more terrible at drawing a decent looking male character. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElegantGothicLolita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElegantGothicLolita">Elegant Gothic Lolita</a> costumes most characters wear also reduce the need to have to draw properly proportioned limbs and bodies, leaving only heads and hands. While ZUN's art has gotten better over the years and art in official mangas and spinoff games is left to other artists, by now the series has become so synonymous with "girls shooting each other with lasers" that any serious attempt to shake up the status quo would likely be met with backlash, which was why ZUN ultimately swapped the male Myouren Hijiri with his sister Byakuren in <em>Unidentified Fantastic Object</em>.
</li><li> The entire storyline of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamSeries">Batman: Arkham Series</a></em> is essentially built around inventing new reasons to put Batman in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">fully explorable</a> Gotham City locales that are <em>big</em>, but not so big that they would take too long to render with appropriate levels of detail. From the beginning, the staff at Rocksteady apparently knew that it would be nearly impossible to bring a life-sized virtual recreation of Gotham City to the screen with the levels of detail that they wanted, so they opted for smaller, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosedCircle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosedCircle">closed-off</a> environments that are nonetheless filled to the brim with secrets, puzzles, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Eggs</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a></em> takes place in Arkham Asylum while it's locked down during a hostage situation, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity">Batman: Arkham City</a></em> takes place in a section of Gotham that's been walled off and turned into a hellish prison camp, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamKnight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a></em> takes place in a quarantined section of downtown Gotham during a chemical attack by the Scarecrow. Even in the latter two games, which take place in the city proper, the storylines are written so that the developers didn't have to put extra work into rendering pedestrians and city traffic.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan3">Mega Man 3</a></em>, the developers wanted a rematch against the robot bosses of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan2">Mega Man 2</a></em>, but there was not enough space for eight enemies' sprites. The solution? Make Mega Man fight eight times against a single enemy named Doc Robot/Dokurobo ("Skullbot") who mimicked their attacks and movement patterns!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">According to Rand Miller</a>, the game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myst">Myst</a></em> was originally intended to solely be an exploration game where the player mainly took in the story and copious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">Scenery Porn</a>. However the team needed to find a way to slow down the player enough to load the areas, so they implemented puzzles you had to solve to get to the Ages and wrote the story about how paranoid Atrius was about someone finding the books, resulting in the <em>Myst</em> series becoming one of the defining point-and-click puzzle game series.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em>, this is how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">Ganondorf</a>'s controversial portrayal as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovesetClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovesetClone">Moveset Clone</a> of Captain Falcon came about. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasahiroSakurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasahiroSakurai">Masahiro Sakurai</a> originally had no plans to include him as a playable character in <em>Melee</em>, but late in development, felt obligated to do so as he was the most popular <em>Zelda</em> character in a poll he conducted earlier. He eventually realized that Ganondorf's build would fit Captain Falcon's animations easily, and so his model from a GameCube tech demo was ported into the game with this in mind. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact">remains this way</a> in all future installments in spite of being portrayed as a sword-wielding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a> in future <em>Zelda</em> games, although he also had his animations redone in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl">Brawl</a></em> to resemble certain hand-to-hand moves that he does in various games in his home series, while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate">Ultimate</a></em> gives him a sword for Smash attacks but otherwise leaves him largely the same.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat9">Mortal Kombat 9</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestFighter">Guest Fighter</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ANightmareOnElmStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ANightmareOnElmStreet">Freddy Krueger</a> has a blurb in his story that explains why he's wearing a second claw-glove, even though he usually only wears one. This is to address the fact that <em>MK9</em> lets all the characters switch their stance on command, meaning Freddy's attacks must be consistent regardless if he's leading with his left or right hand (as Front and Back limbs will change each time a character's stance changes).
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> trope exists, in large part, because of the technical limitations that video games faced when the medium was still in its infancy (hence <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">Nintendo</a> being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a>). In a time when limited memory made it impossible to fit more than about an hour of material on a single game cartridge, the best way to prolong a game's running time was to make it as challenging as humanly possible, ensuring that it took at least several days (if not <em>weeks or months</em>) for all but the most skilled players to beat it. There's a reason games from the 1980s have a reputation for being difficult: their difficulty level may have been frustrating, but it was often the only way to make gamers feel like they'd gotten their money's worth out of a game. By the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">token</a>, arcade games tend to be much more challenging than console games for the same reason: the only way to make them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">economically feasible</a> is to ensure that they're nigh-impossible to beat on the first try, requiring players to spend more money on replays.
<ul><li> With the decline of arcades and technology allowing for longer, more elaborate games, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> trope has even found a new home in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedlyFreeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedlyFreeGame">Free-To-Play</a> model of games that are particularly popular on smartphones. Many of these games are designed to be incredibly hard (or incredibly easy at the first few chapters to draw in players before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultySpike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultySpike">Difficulty Spike</a> rears its ugly head) so that players are encouraged to spend money to receive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">a "cheat" or shortcut method to the next level</a>. Like arcade games, many F2P games would be incredibly short, and thus unprofitable, otherwise.
</li><li> Likewise, indie video games have a greater tendency to rely on high difficulty for artificial length compared to their big-name developer counterparts. Partially because many of them want to recreate the difficulty of their favorite childhood video games, and partially because their lower budgets cause them to be short otherwise.
</li></ul></li><li> Homebrew <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualNovel">Visual Novels</a>, especially the romance ones taking place in schools, often make the player character choose one among the several extra-class activities (like thematic clubs or sports teams) when it is clear later that he/she could have taken part of almost all of them at the same time. The official reason is "to focus more on the girl/boy the protagonist will end up dating", but could also be because of all the complexities at programming and loads of extra lines of dialogue and plot sections that should be added to take account of the role these activities would take place in the plot.
<ul><li> One example is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/KatawaShoujo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/KatawaShoujo">Katawa Shoujo</a></em>, where male lead Hisao rejects love interest candidate Shizune's invitations to join the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyPowerfulStudentCouncil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyPowerfulStudentCouncil">student council</a> if his choices bring him closer to Rin or Emi, but the other options are not all that time-consuming: Emi's "morning running team" runs at the earliest hours of the day and Rin's art club meets two times a week.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Fallen Child looks near identical to Frisk because when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TobyFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TobyFox">Toby Fox</a> asked Temmie to storyboard the intro, she got the number of stripes on Frisk's shirt wrong. This ended up a key plot point, as Asriel mistakes Frisk for Chara in the Pacifist ending.</span>
<ul><li> In <em>Undertale</em>, player choice is a HUGE aspect of the game, as just about everything you do affects the game world and the characters. However, <em>Undertale</em>'s sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Deltarune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Deltarune">Deltarune</a></em>, makes it clear from the very start that player choice does NOT matter, and that the story is completely out of your control. This is done partly for story reasons, but also because <em>Deltarune</em> is a way bigger and more complicated game than <em>Undertale</em>, so implementing that many branching storylines would be nigh impossible.

Most of the characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">who may or may not have survived the first game</a> (like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">Urdnot Wrex</a>, the Citadel Council, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">either Ashley Williams or Kaidan Alenko</a></span>) have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">drastically reduced roles</a>, with some being relegated to brief <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCameo">cameos</a>. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, this was because the sheer number of branching story-lines brought about by the first two games' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">Multiple Endings</a> were already taxing the software for the planned <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>. By keeping the number of returning characters to a minimum, the developers were able to keep the number of possible story-lines to a somewhat manageable level.
</li><li> Kanto in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">Pokémon Gold and Silver</a></em> is rather empty compared to how it was in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">Pokémon Red and Blue</a></em> (set three years prior in-universe), with dungeons and areas like Mt. Moon, the Safari Zone, and Cerulean Cave either scaled down or gone entirely. Even Cinnabar Island, an entire town, is destroyed. Of course, this is to be expected when putting two whole regions into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy">Game Boy</a> cartridge, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/GeniusProgramming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/GeniusProgramming">which is a miracle in itself</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver</a></em>, released for the more advanced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a>, added some of the missing areas back in.

</li></ul></li><li> For the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle">Mata Nui Online Game</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LEGO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LEGO">LEGO</a> hired Templar Studios to create a browser <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointAndClickGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointAndClickGame">Point-and-Click Game</a> promoting their <em>Bionicle</em> toys, but only let them use side characters and random nobodies, while the main products, the Toa, were set to star in a PC game. Templar took the task immensely seriously, and the limitations allowed them to put heavy emphasis on atmosphere — <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myst">Myst</a></em> was cited as an inspiration — and world-building, and create likable characters out of the everyday villagers, who kept the outlandish world and lore grounded in familiarity. The Toa only made brief appearances, making them mysterious and memorable. The game helped catapult the toyline into success and is widely regarded by fans as the finest piece of <em>Bionicle</em> media — meanwhile, the PC game, which had very little of what made <em>MNOG</em> so beloved, was scrapped due to quality issues. As a result, Templar was asked to wrap up the Toa's plot along with the villagers', which made for a fulfilling climax. Not only that, many characters fleshed out by Templar became major players in later stories when LEGO realized their popularity.
</li><li> The makers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YokusIslandExpress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YokusIslandExpress">Yoku's Island Express</a></em>, Jens Andersson and Mattias Snygg, initially set out to make a game in one year without a dedicated animator. Hence, they decided to "make a game about a ball" because that would be easy to animate. While the scope and timeframe for the game's development expanded quite a bit from that initial idea, they continued to retain the focus on the ball, resulting in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metroidvania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metroidvania">Metroidvania</a> controlled like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball">pinball</a> game.

The game gets around this by making the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> the second player in a meta-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingYourFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingYourFriend">Fighting Your Friend</a> situation.

<ul><li> Yahtzee declared that older horror games are more frightening than the newer ones, because the older games had to have "fog" due to technical limitations, and the monsters weren't as well fleshed out, leaving the details up to the viewer's imagination. And when it's up to your subconscious, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier">it's always scarier</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Yahtzee:</strong> This was part of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SilentHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SilentHill">Silent Hill</a></em> from the beginning. Konami wanted to make a full-3D survival horror game, but since they were making it on the PS1 they had to wind back the draw distance to about six inches and make up a story about supernatural fog. Result: instantly iconic horror, and by following the same principle, <em>Silent Hill 2</em> still looks fantastic despite the PS2's datedness.
</div></li><li> This was part of a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/extra-punctuation/6400-Silent-Hill-2.2">column<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> he wrote about several "rules" game developers should follow, one of which was something like "Thou Shalt Always Embrace One's Limitations", which is this trope in a nutshell.
</li><li> He also thought that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DriverSanFrancisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DriverSanFrancisco">Driver: San Francisco</a></em> was all the better for explaining the body-jumping mechanic and all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">Acceptable Breaks from Reality</a> as part of Tanner's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventuresInComaland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventuresInComaland">Adventures in Comaland</a>.

</li><li> More directly, the show <em>Zero Punctuation</em> itself came about because of this trope. Yahtzee wanted to do some video-style <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay">Lets Plays</a>, but lacked video capture equipment and software and wanted to do it on the cheap. So he decided to record his voice and draw a few doodles in MS Paint and compose it together into a video. After two videos someone from The Escapist saw his stuff, found it amusing, and offered him a deal. The rest is history.

To create his original incarnation, the author used a cheat code that makes <em>all</em> the non-player characters large, so it would be impossible to have the large Large Beetle in one shot with normal-sized characters.
</li><li> Link VS Cloud was the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/DeathBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/DeathBattle">Death Battle</a> to be done in 3D. However, this was less a stylistic choice and more practical, as the majority of Link's available 2D sprites were in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopDownView" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopDownView">Top-Down View</a>, which would've been unusual for a Death Battle since they are often similar to a 2D fighting game in appearance — meanwhile Cloud, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">debut game</a> was 3D, had never been playable in a 2D game at the time of the video's release, so he had <em>no</em> 2D sprites to work with.

<ul><li> The webcomic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BobAndGeorge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BobAndGeorge">Bob and George</a></em> is made of this trope. Originally the comic was supposed to be a hand-drawn comic about teenage superheroes.

However, the author, Dave Anez, was a self-admitted lousy artist and the hand-drawn comic wouldn't pan out. After trying and failing multiple times he gave up. By then the "filler" sprite comic had become so popular that it became the main comic and a storyline was written to bring the title characters into the plot. Subsequent storylines would frequently change direction in order to fill in plot holes.
<ul><li> Another prominent example is the existence of the Helmeted Author. Originally it was meant to be the normal Author character who was now wearing a helmet because it was impossible to render a helmetless sprite in certain positions. However, Dave later accidentally put both the normal and Helmeted Author sprites in one holiday comic. As a result, the Helmeted Author went on to become not only a separate character but a major recurring villain.

<ul><li> From <em>The Furious D Show</em>, a blog about pop culture and the business behind it, <a class="urllink" href="http://dknowsall.blogspot.com/2010/06/hollywood-babble-on-on-528-curse-of.html">Hollywood Babble On &amp; On #528: The Curse of the Dark Castle.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<div class="indent">I think it was Stephen King who said that horror has to be cheap because big budgets require big explanations. If a company is spending tens of millions of dollars on special effects, a filmmaker is compelled to show the entire monster in loving detail. That kills the mystery, and with it, the horror. It's actually better to cheap out, because then the filmmakers have to use darkness, and mystery to hide the fact that they're made of rubber and string, hence escalating the potential for horror.
</div></li><li> The author of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChaosTimeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChaosTimeline">Chaos Timeline</a></em> originally had planned to call the internet of this world "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman">Weltnetz</a>" but found out that German neo-Nazis use this term already for the existing internet, so he changed it to "Weltsystem".

<ul><li> A music editor decided to make the turrets from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal">Portal</a></em> sing. Some parts of the song didn't work out well, so the editor made a story about this crazy person who blew up Aperture Science Enrichment Center before he could finish. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnZxQiLGDtk">Watch it here!<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The running gag of Tallales missing his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">Nice Hat</a> in every episode past the third of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/WorldsGreatestAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/WorldsGreatestAdventures">World's Greatest Adventures</a></em> was due to, well, losing the prop.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd">The Angry Video Game Nerd</a>'s</em> review of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari5200" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari5200">Atari 5200</a> is just him struggling to hook the thing up and get it to work, and constantly running into problems like faulty hookups, faulty controllers, and even being scammed by a fake replacement controller he bought online. He never actually plays a game, because these were all real issues that he had trying to film the video for real and ultimately made that the focus of the episode since it fairly effectively illustrated the issues that made the console so unpopular.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/JonTron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/JonTron">JonTron</a>'s</em> <em>BUYING DUMB THINGS ONLINE</em> video when he's brought a package by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Amazon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Amazon">Amazon</a> that is a shamelessly bad special effect and obviously being held up by strings with drone sound effects. Jon wastes no time poking fun at how they actually did try to use the drone for real to disastrous results:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Jon:</strong> Oh hey there Mr. Postman Drone! The special effect that absolutely nothing went wrong with!
</div><div class="indent"> (Cut to chaotic footage of the drone actually carrying the box, crashing and smashing apart over the caption (EXPENSIVE MISTAKE SOUNDS) while various people yell "No!")
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Jon:</strong> Don't do anything crazy like almost kill my crew again!

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTales">VeggieTales</a></em> came into being because the creators were limited to armless, legless, hairless characters thanks to rudimentary CGI. Phil Vischer's first choice was an anthropomorphic candy bar, but his wife suggested parents would appreciate a hero who promoted healthier eating habits; hence the talking fruits and vegetables.
</li><li> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Goofy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Goofy">Goofy</a>'s voice actor Pinto Colvig left the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> studio in the late 1930s, the film-makers needed to come up with a quick solution to hide the character's voicelessness before finding a replacement. They did this by creating an entire series around a world of mute Goofy look-alikes performing everyday tasks, while a narrator (voiced by John McLeish) explained what the characters were doing to the audience. The <em>How to...</em> shorts went on to become the most famous of all the Goofy series and continued even after Colvig returned to voice the character in the mid-1940s.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> was an entirely CGI program, which made it quite expensive. As a result, it had a smaller cast than other <em>Transformers</em> shows, leading to a stronger focus on the characterization of the existing characters.
<ul><li> Early on, the show's story editors found Waspinator's character problematic because his buzzing, drawn-out speaking pattern wasted precious screentime. Their solution was to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyKilledKennyAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyKilledKennyAgain">kill him in every episode</a> (so that he couldn't talk). The running gag became very popular with both the fans and writers, to the point of entirely defining Waspinator's character and sparing him from being killed off at Hasbro's insistence.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot">ReBoot</a></em> was the first ever 3D animated series. Mainframe knew the technical limitations it was under and instead of trying to hide the fact that the software was still rather primitive, the company set the series within a computer, explaining why everything was so pristine and polygonal. This also allowed for several computer-based jokes to get crap past the radar as well as reusing character models and assets (even from other shows).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em>:
<ul><li> During Season 3 and 4, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FreddiePrinzeJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FreddiePrinzeJr">Freddie Prinze Jr.</a> was undergoing neck surgery, resulting in Kanan having less screentime to allow him to recover.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jacen</span>'s eye-color was supposed to be the same as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kanan</span>'s, but the animators mistakenly gave him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dume</span>'s instead. In a poetic way, it still works given that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dume is a part of Kanan through Force shenanigans</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>, the budget for the fourth book was cut by an amount equal to a fully animated episode. To fill the need for the thirteenth episode, the main developing team was forced to choose between firing most of the show's crew weeks earlier than planned or creating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow">Clip Show</a>. They obviously chose the Clip Show over firing their friends and tried to emulate the feeling of the prior show's "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AvatarTheLastAirbenderTheEmberIslandPlayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AvatarTheLastAirbenderTheEmberIslandPlayers">The Ember Island Players</a>".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> was a very high-concept show since its inception, but because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexHirsch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexHirsch">its creator's</a> inexperience with running a TV series and his doubts over its longevity, he chose to keep the first season focused specifically between Mabel and Dipper's relationship while side characters and the over-arcing plot were kept downplayed. While this did benefit the show in the long run, it still led to criticism towards many of the side characters (specifically Soos and Wendy) who many viewers felt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot">were uninteresting or lacked proper development</a>. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16nnyx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note16nnyx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16nnyx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This especially went double for Wendy as her VA <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LindaCardellini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LindaCardellini">Linda Cardellini</a> was committed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SanjayAndCraig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SanjayAndCraig">to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen">other</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow">television</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bloodline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bloodline">roles</a> and was also busy with her newfound family during <em>Gravity Falls</em>' run, meaning she was likely unavailable for recording sessions which only further strained her character's involvement in the show.</span>
