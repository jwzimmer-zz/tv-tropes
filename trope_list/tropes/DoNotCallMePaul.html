</li><li> Misaki Yata in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/K" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/K">K</a></em> - he thinks his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName">Gender-Blender Name</a> takes away from his tough-guy image.

<div class="indent"><strong>Gai</strong>: Jiro Yamada is just the boring old name my mother gave me. Gai Daigoji is the name that belongs to my soul!!!
</div></li><li> Son Goku of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> will always insist that his name is not Kakarot. While Kakarot is indeed his birth name, he was unaware of his Saiyan heritage until his mid 20s, so... He does eventually accept Vegeta calling him this, probably because he knows Vegeta is too stubborn to stop if asked. Indeed, Vegeta makes something of a point of always calling him "Kakarot", as he feels that Goku should be proud of his Saiyan heritage. If Vegeta refers to him by his Earth name, it's a sign that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHimself">Not Himself</a>. (This however only happens in dubs; he always calls him "Kakarotto" in Japanese.)
<ul><li> The only canonical time when Goku denied his birth name was when he learned from his heritage from Raditz, his older brother he never heard about, and he's absolutely terrified and disgusted by the viciousness of the Saiyan race he might have been belonging to. It's natural for Goku to reject his heritage at that point, since he didn't want anything to do with it. The non-canon movies, particularly movie 3 and movie 4 brought this up again, where Goku claimed to be an Earthling rather than a Saiyan and he kept telling Tullece that his name is Goku, not Kakarot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuperBroly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuperBroly">Dragon Ball Super: Broly</a></em> marks the first time ever in the franchise <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Goku introduces himself as also Kakarot. Goku introduces himself to Broly once they start to form a friendship at the very end of the movie, this is such a big deal there's even a theme tune to put emphasis on Goku fully accepting his Saiyan name, as such name now carries the good legacy of his good Saiyan parents Bardock and Gine, not of a bloodthirsty race anymore.</span> It's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">Mythology Gag</a> to the non-canon Broly's tendency to only say "Kakarot" and nothing else.
</li></ul></li><li> Yusaku Godai of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaisonIkkoku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaisonIkkoku">Maison Ikkoku</a></em> is only ever called by his first name by his parents and his grandmother in the original Japanese (some translations change this). The only time someone else used his first name, it was schoolgirl stalker, Ibuki Yagami (when he insisted she stop calling him Godai-sensei, since he wasn't her teacher any more, she says, "I understand, Yusaku-san.") Poor guy looked like it gave him hives.
</li><li> Played straight and inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TekkamanBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TekkamanBlade">Tekkaman Blade</a></em>. At the beginning of the series, Blade claims to have forgotten his name, which leads to Noal nicknaming him D-Boy. About 20 episodes later, when the crew finds out his given name (Aiba Takaya), he insists that his name is D-boy (For about half an episode anyway before spilling the beans.) It becomes an inversion toward the end of the series when he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "forgets that the Space Knights have nicknamed him "D-boy" and insists that they call him his given name"</span>. Played straight again when after defeating his brother, he sheds his birthname and nickname, claiming that he is Tekkaman Blade.
<div class="indent"><strong>"D-boy and Aiba Takaya are dead. I am Tekkaman Blade!"</strong>
</div></li><li> Zera, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LitchiHikariClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LitchiHikariClub">Litchi Hikari Club</a></em>'s self-proclaimed "Emperor of Ruin", becomes rather irate when addressed as Tsunegawa, his family name.
<div class="indent"><em>"Is my blood Tsunegawa? No. Is my flesh Tsunegawa? No. Tsunegawa is vague and intangible. According to the Hikari Club, I am designated as Zera."</em>
</div></li><li> Yoshiko from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LoveLiveSunshine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LoveLiveSunshine">Love Live! Sunshine!!</a></em> insists on being called Yohane. As for why, well, she's the group's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chuunibyou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chuunibyou">Chuunibyou</a>.
</li><li> Papillion Mask from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin">Buso Renkin</a></em> proclaimed that the only person allowed to call him by his real name (Kousaku) is the protagonist Kazuki.
</li><li> Raizo Yamada in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ValvraveTheLiberator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ValvraveTheLiberator">Valvrave the Liberator</a></em> insists on being called "<em>San</em>da" ("Thunder"). Pretty much no one goes along with it, but he'll still "correct" people on it, at times like... in the middle of a mecha battle in space.
</li><li> Natsuno Yuuki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Shiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Shiki">Shiki</a></em> dislikes being called by his first name. He gives up trying to correct people after a certain point.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> Light spends much of his time seeking the real names and faces of his enemies to be plugged into the titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDeath">Artifact of Death</a> (It won't work with nicknames).

By the end of the book, however, he admits he can't get used to it and decides that he will be known as "George" for legal purposes and to those who don't really know him, but to friends and family, he's "Sticky."

He doesn't actually mind this, except that "Piscine" sounds like "pissing," which people would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaliciousMisnaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaliciousMisnaming">maliciously</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMisnaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMisnaming">accidentally</a> use. Eventually, on the first day of a new school year, he got his nickname by rushing to the chalkboard and drawing a pi symbol with the words "My name is Pi Patel" every time the teacher was about to call him for roll.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTraitorSonCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTraitorSonCycle">The Traitor Son Cycle</a></em>, the Red Knight reacts with anger to being called by his given name, as for one, he's faked his death and is trying to hide that, and for other, the past he's left behind is still too painful to return to.

After that, she went by Daisy, which everyone went along with except Coulson who'd forget and call her Skye.
<ul><li> A subtler example from the same series: Fitz is the last main character in the first season to have his first name (Leo, short for Leopold) mentioned on-screen, and seems genuinely a bit annoyed whenever it's brought up, which is usually only in the context of formal introductions.

When she refers to him as such when they meet again, he reminds her that he doesn't like that name. He also uses "Cavil", but this is just an alias he was using while posing as a priest among the human fleet.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackLightning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackLightning">Black Lightning</a></em>, Lala really hates being called by his birth name Latavius Johnson.

Once he started idealizing his father and resenting his mother, he went back to Walt Jr. In season five, he gets fed up with the way <em>both</em> parents refuse to tell him what's going on and switches back to Flynn.

Why they gave up their name and chose the name "The Doctor" has only been hinted as being because of some terrible secret. Also, "the Doctor" is more than just a name. It's a promise ("never cruel or cowardly; never give up, never give in").
<ul><li> Clara makes an impassioned speech to the other Time Lords that "The Doctor" really <em>is</em> their name at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2013CSTheTimeOfTheDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2013CSTheTimeOfTheDoctor">this point</a>, because they have always <em>lived up to that promise</em>.

<ul><li> In a couple of the Big Finish audio stories, she even swears off "Ace" for a while, insisting that the Doctor call her "McShane" or Dorothy. However, since both of those instances are times where she's quite pissed off at the Doctor, she goes back to Ace once she gets over it.

As he later explained in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfessionCam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfessionCam">Confession Cam</a> (and to Ramsay after the service), Bobby was the name of his father, a cruel man who told Robert that he would never amount to anything, making it obvious why the name offended him.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em>, Sylar insists on being called by his new nickname, as opposed to his birth name Gabriel, which is part of his discarded, "normal" identity.

He's almost always "Gibbs" or "Boss". Those who he considers to be truly close may call him "Jethro". And only those who knew him as a child may address him as "Leroy" and most of those have passed away.
</li><li> Recurring villain Ari Haswari responds to "Haswari" (his Arab name), but not "Ari" (his Jewish name). So, of course, Gibbs calls him "Ari" just to piss him off.

Flake Lorenz doesn't like his given name, Christian, and has declared that Flake <em>is</em> his proper name. Christoph Schneider usually goes by either "Doom" or his last name.

Also ironic is that he hated the nickname at first (it's short for "Bono Vox", Latin for "Good Voice"). The Edge, from the same band, was originally named David Howell Evens, but says that now even his close family call him Edge.
</li><li> Don't call Rogue of The Crüxshadows Virgil or Roger.
</li><li> His ex-wife <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DitaVonTeese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DitaVonTeese">Dita Von Teese</a> has confirmed that no one other than his mother calls <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson">Marilyn Manson</a> "Brian". His friends and bandmates are split as to whether they refer to him as Marilyn or Manson.

Her name was legally changed to "Miley Ray Cyrus" in 2007 (although her co-writing credits on <em>Meet Miley Cyrus</em> are credited to "Destiny Hope Cyrus" in the CD jacket).
</li><li> Fergie is not to be called "Stacey". To seal the deal, she changed her legal name to Fergie Duhamel in August 2013.

</li><li> Also, many Jews and some Christian denominations believe God does not like to be called "God", preferring "The Lord". And many more Jews will get quite annoyed if you try to guess his real name and call him "Yahweh" or "Jehovah".

<ul><li> It is interesting to note that wrestling name conventions stick for a long time. For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> is <em>always</em> Undertaker or 'Taker. Unless, of course, you're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">Ric Flair</a>, who met him during his 'Mean' Mark Callous days and, as such, calls him Mark. It extends on most of the time, though there are exceptions. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LanceStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LanceStorm">Lance Storm</a>, for example, refers to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GregoryHelms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GregoryHelms">Shane Helms as The Hurricane</a>, even though he met him during the Shane Helms days.
</li><li> Pro wrestling locker room etiquette demands that new wrestlers must introduce themselves to the older wrestlers, and then call them whatever the older wrestler introduces himself as.
</li><li> Despite what some smarks think, the names you hear on TV are what they are called in real life. This was spoofed on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CelebrityDeathmatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CelebrityDeathmatch">Celebrity Deathmatch</a></em> where a demon mocked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> by calling him Mark. It was also alluded to during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MinistryOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MinistryOfDarkness">Ministry of Darkness</a> angle when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> said that "Mark" had begun to think his gimmick was real.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge">Edge</a> once mentioned in an interview that the reason he didn't like to be called his real name by fans is that the fans only know Edge, the wrestling character. They aren't familiar with Adam Copeland, the person who portrays said character. He has since changed his attitude after retiring from wrestling, preferring his real name when it comes to things not directly involving wrestling, such as his acting career.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a> has said in an interview of his own that, since he's been called "Punk" from his early teens, "Phil Brooks" is not a desired name while in the wrestling business.

</li></ul></li><li> Notable that part-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBigShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBigShow">The Big Show</a> actually <em>did</em> wrestle under his real name for a while when he made his WWF debut in 1999, before phasing it out. He also went to work under the ring name "Paul 'The Great' Wight" after leaving WWE for a time around 2007 before going back to "The Big Show" moniker upon his return.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a> did as well, sort of. In WCW he was <em>Jean</em>-Paul Levesque.

It is probably not coincidental that, with superstar movie career firmly established, Johnson fired that manager and hired his ex-wife in his place around the same time he returned into the WWE fold; since his 2011 special appearance run, he has not been averse to being called The Rock outside of the ring, unlike before. However, arch-rivals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a> still refer to him as "Dwayne" consistently in a mocking fashion.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UltimateWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UltimateWarrior">The Ultimate Warrior</a> actually <em>legally changed his name</em> to "Warrior" (a step up, to be sure, from "James Hellwig"). But this was by many accounts for trademark-related reasons and not personal ones. Other wrestlers have also changed their names to their wrestling names, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a> (formerly Steve Williams) changing his name to "Steve Austin" in 2007, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DiamondDallasPage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DiamondDallasPage">Diamond Dallas Page</a> (formerly Page Falkenburg) changing his name to "Dallas Page" in 2003, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Chyna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Chyna">Chyna</a> (born Joan Marie Laurer) legally changing her name to "Chyna" (for trademark reasons much like Warrior) in 2007.
</li><li> Andrew Martin, best known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Test" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Test">Test</a>, actually had his middle name changed legally to Test so he could continue to use the Test gimmick (which was owned by WWE). However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StacyKeibler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StacyKeibler">Stacy Keibler</a>, among others, would at times on WWE TV address him as "Andrew."
</li><li> Similar to Test, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Ryback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Ryback">Ryback</a> (born Ryan Allen Reeves) legally changed his first name to Ryback so he can compete using that name outside of WWE.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RickRude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RickRude">Rick Rude</a>'s real name was Richard Rood, so that wasn't much of a stretch.
</li><li> Used during a storyline where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EricBischoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EricBischoff">Eric Bischoff</a> was being put on trial to see if he could remain RAW GM. "The Masterpiece" Chris Masters was called in to testify on behalf of Bischoff, but Vince was able to discredit his testimony by proving he committed perjury, as his name isn't really Chris Masters, but Chris Mordetzky. This was quickly forgotten and his real last name was never mentioned on TV again.
</li><li> In most of his professional life, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho">Chris Jericho</a> goes by his nickname. However, for one night on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DancingWithTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DancingWithTheStars">Dancing with the Stars</a></em>, he subverted this by being announced by his real name Chris Irvine, as he was honoring his late mother by dancing to her favorite song. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Heartwarming/ChrisJericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Heartwarming/ChrisJericho">Aww</a>. Jericho once made an appearance on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a> going by "Chris Irvine" as well.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WilliamRegal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WilliamRegal">William Regal</a> is an interesting case; he finds it rude to be addressed as "Regal" due to English customs; he's typically addressed backstage as Darren (his real name) or "Steve" (his longtime former ring name).

</li><li> One form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XPacHeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XPacHeat">X-Pac Heat</a> is to chant a wrestler's former ring name at them, especially if that wrestler is now embodying a worse gimmick than before (a good example of this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattBloom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattBloom">Matt Bloom</a>'s transition from being Albert/A-Train in the early and mid-2000s to his return to the company as Lord Tensai in 2012, where he got several "Albert" chants upon his debut). There's also an inversion of this: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrayWyatt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrayWyatt">Bray Wyatt</a> is sometimes referred to by smarks as his previous unsuccessful gimmick, "Husky Harris", leading to Wyatt suggesting that the disappearance of Harris is due to Wyatt using him as a vessel.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MalcolmX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MalcolmX">Malcolm X</a> was born Malcolm Little, a name he never took to. He changed his name to Detroit Red as a teenager, and finally to "Malcolm X" upon joining the Nation of Islam. Even after breaking ties with the church, he never looked back at his old name. (He changed it again to Malcolm Shabazz or Malik el-Shabazz, but "X" stuck in the minds of the public.)

He started publishing short stories using both his real name and several pseudonyms (including Evan Hunter) as early as 1951. When informed by a publisher in 1952 that a novel he wrote would sell more copies credited to "Evan Hunter" than if it were credited to "S.A. Lombino", he didn't just stick with the pen name — Lombino <em>legally changed his name</em> to Evan Hunter. He exclusively employed the name Evan Hunter in his personal life from then on, and later wrote that he would not answer to "Sal" under any circumstances, not even if you had known him prior to the name change.
</li><li> A production snafu with Reebok and UFC ended up creating several fighter jerseys going by the birth names of many fighters who normally go by other names personally and professionally, including Cub Swanson (who hasn't gone by "Kevin" since he was a young child) and Yoel Romero (born in Cuba as Yoel Romero Palacio per <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishNamingConventions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishNamingConventions">standard Hispanic convention</a>, but like many Hispanics is known mainly by his father's surname of Romero). These were taken off their website quickly and corrected, though supposedly a few were sold before the errors were caught.
<ul><li> Legendary MMA fighter Tito Ortiz has never gone by his birth name of "Jacob," his parents have called him Tito since he was an infant. He will merely look at you blankly if you call him that.
</li><li> Interestingly, the UFC itself has a policy against letting fighters have stage names, and very few fighters are allowed to compete under nicknames only (IE, Andrei "The Pitbull" Arlovski is fine, but not "The Pitbull"), unless it's been a long established personal name they're widely known by. This includes Mirko Cro Cop (rumors are the UFC dropped his last name Filipović because it was too hard to say for American fans, despite him using it when he was in PRIDE), Kimbo Slice (because no one is going to pay to see Kevin Furgeson fight), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a> (since he was MUCH more widely recognized by that name from his time in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling">Professional Wrestling</a>.

But we can. When he got divorced, the terms of the settlement were that his now-ex-wife was entitled to and would receive half the income "Jim Owsley" made. So Jim Owsley stopped working in comics, and Christopher Priest began.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/LetsDrownOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/LetsDrownOut">Let's Drown Out</a></em> he explained that he mostly stopped using his given name when he first moved to Australia, and local associates asked what he wanted to be called (Australian nicknaming conventions being what they are); he said that he associated being called 'Ben' with unhappy childhood memories and difficult family relationships, so to him the handle of 'Yahtzee' is associated with creative freedom and greater self-expression.
</li><li> Yahtzee's former colleague, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Jimquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Jimquisition">Jim Sterling</a>, was born James Stanton, but doesn't use it <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324090022/https://ask.fm/Jimquisition/answers/135370745058">to distance himself from his abusive childhood<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

Indeed, as Jim's father was also called Jim, he says that his family call him (his middle name) Rod, his friends call him Jim and his fans call him Vic. When he appeared with his wife on the UK version of <em>I'm a Celebrity! Get Me Out of Here!</em>, it was a bit odd for fans to hear her referring to him as Jim when the voting lines and show presenters all called him Vic. You can also very occasionally hear Bob Mortimer accidentally call him Jim when they're performing, although he will immediately corrects himself.
</li><li> Allegedly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello">Elvis Costello</a> is also like this, preferring to be called his birth name (Declan McManus) by family or in a non-performance context.

You see, Elvis was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealMenLoveJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealMenLoveJesus">devout Christian</a> and genuinely humble man, so to his mind "The King" was, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">the King of Kings</a>, and "the King of Rock and Roll" was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FatsDomino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FatsDomino">Fats Domino</a> (he felt that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooBlack">he had only gotten the appellation because he was white</a> and that Domino was a far better musician). To his friends and associates, if he wasn't Elvis, he was "E".
</li><li> The writers of OAFEnet prefer to be called by the names they use on the site, and even call each other those names, despite having worked together for years.

There are several different stories as to why he changed it, but one can imagine that being called "Hopelessly" and "Hopeless" as a child had something to do with it.

</li><li> John, James, George and Richard... it doesn't have the same ring as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">John, Paul, George and Ringo</a>, does it? Not to mention, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieIzzard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieIzzard">Eddie Izzard</a>'s joke about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope">Pope</a> names wouldn't work.
<ul><li> Papal names themselves began with another example of this trope — a sixth-century priest named Mercurius was elected Pope, and decided that a name honoring a pagan god was not appropriate for the leader of the Christian church. He reigned under the name "John II".

Myers<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is almost a literal invocation of this trope — P.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson">Marilyn Manson</a> is, in case you couldn't tell, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageNames">not his real name</a>. Yet, even his dad, who Manson has described as "more of a rock star than myself" calls him Manson. For those who are wondering, he was born Brian Hugh Warner, his middle name coming from his father's first name. Originally all of the members of the band took stage names that were combinations of (female) sex symbols and serial killers as a commentary on the two things they felt America obsessed over the most, but none of the others is so well known as Marilyn due to him changing the band's name from "Marilyn Manson and The Spooky Kids" to just "Marilyn Manson", so most people never caught on. (The one who gets closer is Twiggy Ramirez, but he still plays in other projects under birth name Jeordie White.)
</li><li> Inverted by Paul Muni, whose birth name was Meshilem Meier Weisenfreund. His friends and close associates called him "Muni", an Austrian diminutive of Meshilem, which he had been called since birth. Strangers called him Mr. Muni. Only those who were trying to act like they were close (such as meddling executives) called him Paul.
</li><li> Zigzagged with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWayne">John Wayne</a>. People either called him Duke or Marion (his birth name). If you called him "John", it took him a minute to figure out who the hell you were talking to. In fact, he wasn't even in the room when his studio held the meeting where they decided to stop billing him as Duke Morrison and coined the name "John Wayne".
</li><li> WABC-TV reporter N.J. Burkett has the full name Newton Jones Burkett, but prefers to be addressed by his nickname.

</li><li> Over the years some people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiddleNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiddleNameBasis">have gone by their middle names instead of the first names</a>, dropping their first names entirely when being referred to, such as Stephen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GroverCleveland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GroverCleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>, Clinton <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardDawkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardDawkins">Richard Dawkins</a>, Thomas <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WoodrowWilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WoodrowWilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>, and Willard Mitt Romney. No word on whether any of these examples get mad if referred to by their first or full names, but they still seem to prefer their middle ones.
<ul><li> Then there is Hiram Ulysses Grant, who became Ulysses S. Grant due to an error made during his entry to West Point. Being called "US Grant" didn't hurt him any as a Presidential candidate.

As a child, he gave himself the nickname that would follow him through his military and legal careers, and as a kid beat up any of the other kids that called him Lynn.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em> creator Charles M. Schulz obviously used his given name professionally, but among friends and relatives he preferred to be called Sparky, the nickname he was first given by an uncle two days after he was born.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyBoy">Pretty Boy</a> Jason Sansome only ever goes by either his first name, or VeeOneEye, the name of his channel. In the same vein, PJ Liguori (aka Kickthepj) hasn't told anyone what those initials stand for. Jason has since had his surname changed to Viohni, in keeping with his channel name.
</li><li> The children of sixties and seventies rock stars who were given, er, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoNamesTheirKidDude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoNamesTheirKidDude">unique</a></em> names tend either to accept them philosophically (Moon Unit Zappa, daughter of Frank, just grins and bears it) <a class="urllink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/whatever-happened-to-baby-moon-unit-zappa-6169727.html">or else they change them at the very first opportunity.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Call <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DuncanJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DuncanJones">Duncan Jones</a> "Zowie Bowie" and he might punch you. Similarly, Dandelion Pallenburg-Richards, daughter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithRichards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithRichards">Keith Richards</a> and actress Anita, now expressly wishes to be called Angela (despite having had a Rolling Stones song written for her).
</li><li> Whenever Andy Griffith visited his friend and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAndyGriffithShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAndyGriffithShow">The Andy Griffith Show</a></em> costar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonKnotts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonKnotts">Don Knotts</a> in his last days, he'd try to reach him by using his first name Jesse, knowing how he'd disliked it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChevyChase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChevyChase">Cornelius Crane Chase</a> was given the nickname Chevy (a play on the title of the folk song "The Ballad of Chevy Chase", about a battle in the Cheviot Hills on the English-Scottish border) by his grandmother when he was 2, and Chevy Chase is the name he's answered to pretty much his whole life.
</li><li> While his acting credit is always "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner">William Shatner</a>", he goes by Bill and will correct an interviewer or a new acquaintance promptly.
</li><li> Seattle-based <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Burlesque" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Burlesque">burlesque</a> superstar Lily Verlaine does not answer to "Rachel Gourd", only "Lily" or "Ms. Verlaine". Likewise, fellow burlesque Seattleite Babette La Fave should not be addressed as "Paula".
</li><li> A large number of eSports athletes and shoutcasters commonly go by their on-stage handles. This is especially common for players and casters whose names are foreign and difficult or impossible to pronounce to English speaking fans, i.e. "Sjokz" for Eefje Depoortere or "Faker" for Lee Sang-Hyeok.
</li><li> Bulgarians tend to use nicknames for anyone that's been introduced in an informal environment. Anyone on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis">First-Name Basis</a> using a person's full first name is either mad at them, trying to maintain a boundary (parents or teachers), or is passive-aggressive. For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalTranslation">a person named Robert would be called Bob by his coworkers, Bobby by his friends and family, and Robert if he screws up</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TippiHedren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TippiHedren">Tippi Hedren</a> was born Nathalie Kay Hedren, but soon after her birth, her father started calling her Tippi (derived from a Swedish term for "sweetheart"), and she's always preferred that name.
</li><li> Former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cricket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cricket">cricket</a> star and current <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGearUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGearUK">Top Gear (UK)</a></em> presenter Andrew Flintoff doesn't like being called by his first name. He told fellow presenter Chris Harris on-air that he prefers his nickname of "Freddie". In fact, the BBC credits him as Freddie.
</li><li> Not just limited to people. Outside of very official documents, it's always "LSU" and "UCLA", never "Louisiana State" or "California-Los Angeles". Ditto for Texas-El Paso (who furthermore pronounce their initialism as "you-tep" rather than "you-tee-ee-pee" and Alabama-Birmingham. The University of Southern California also prefers to go by its initials, but that one avoids the same "ubiquitous" status because the same initials can refer to the University of South Carolina.
