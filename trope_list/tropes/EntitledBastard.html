He believes that he is the rightful heir to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">Clow Cards</a> by virtue of being Clow Reed's descendant, whereas Sakura is, in his view, an incompetent weakling. His entire rivalry with Sakura is built on entitlement. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Fortunately, he grows out of it</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">first series</a>, during their first meeting with Master Roshi after returning his pet turtle, Bulma fully expects Roshi to give her a gift in exchange despite the fact that she blatantly refused to initially help Turtle return to the sea, and tried to persuade Goku to feed Turtle to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews">Bear Thief</a> to save her own hide; Turtle even outright says that Goku's the only one who <em>really</em> helped him.
</li><li> During the fight against Frieza in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, Vegeta gets himself critically injured by Krillin as part of a plan to get a power boost by having Dende <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">heal</a> him (Saiyans become more powerful upon recovering from near-death experiences), and is genuinely shocked when Dende refuses to do so since Vegeta <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil">was just as bad as Frieza</a> and had slaughtered countless Namekians himself. He ends up doing so anyway after Piccolo, Gohan, and Krillin point out that they need Vegeta to stand a chance. For bonus points, the first thing Vegeta does after getting healed is punch Dende in the stomach for taking so long.
<ul><li> As a whole, this is Vegeta's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a>, along with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">pride</a> and wrath, before the final fight with Majin Buu. He believes he should be the strongest because he's the Prince of the Saiyans and born exceptionally gifted among his race, whereas Goku was born at the absolute bottom of the Saiyan pecking order. His entire rivalry with Goku is built on entitlement.
</li></ul></li><li> Despite being a sadistic bastard who regularly tortures others and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">Bad Boss</a> to the nth degree, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer">Babidi</a> has the gall to beg Piccolo to help him after being cut in half and left to die. Piccolo rightfully tells him to screw off. He manages to get Majin Buu to heal him shortly after, insisting that if he dies, no one will be able to set Buu free should he be sealed up again.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection F</a></em>, Frieza offers Vegeta a high-ranking position back in his army if he kills Goku for him. Despite the fact that Frieza slaughtered Vegeta's entire species, destroyed his homeworld, belittled him at every turn while Vegeta served him, and tortured him to death for fun back on Namek, he's genuinely shocked when Vegeta shoots his offer down in favor of killing him. Vegeta even lampshades it:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Vegeta</strong>: Use your head. Do you honestly think I would stay loyal to you after you blew up the planet I was destined to rule?!
</div></li><li> The Politicians in charge of the Free Planets Alliance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a></em> come across as this for the large part. The biggest example comes when they beg Yang Wen-li to go out and save their asses from an invasion by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>... while in the middle of trying to hold him under inquiry of <em>questionable</em> legality officially for his previous actions in saving their asses from a military coup not too long before. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> They don't learn a damn thing, do something <em>similar</em> to him later, and those actions end up forcing the Alliance to surrender to the Galactic Empire.</span> <br/><br/>The worst part is that they try to make it appear that they are afraid that Yang would commit a coup d'état of his own, which does not seem at first to be an unreasonable fear considering that the Free Planets Alliance arch-enemy was founded by a successful general turned totalitarian tyrant; but it becomes extremely clear as the series goes that they know that Yang has no dictatorial ambitions and are just terrified by the idea that he might go into politics and win elections legitimately.
</li><li> Paracule from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TowerOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TowerOfGod">Tower of God</a></em>. Plots to overthrow you and cries for your help the next day.
</li><li> The young Priestess Shion from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a>: Shippūden the Movie</em> acted like this, a lot. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out she just did that to keep people from wanting to be around her, 'cause people who get close to her often end up dead</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> many of Ranma and Akane's old enemies/rivals/unwanted fiancé will often come to the Tendō dojo pleading their help with some problem. Notably Sentarō, from the Martial Arts Tea Ceremony episodes, whose antics include kidnapping girl-type Ranma off the street in order to marry her. When he does get Ranma and Akane to help him, he takes advantage of the situation by trying to run off with Akane.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MutekiKanbanMusume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MutekiKanbanMusume">Muteki Kanban Musume</a></em>: Miki never has any doubts asking for help from the people she constantly bullies and abuses.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> showcases this with a worryingly large number of the wealthy, but best highlighted with one who obstructs an emergency exit with a cart piled with goods, flat-out <em>telling</em> Mikasa to her face that they're there just to die so people like him can live, while also pulling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections">Screw the Rules, I Have Connections!</a> when she threatens him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, there's a subversion: Post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, a group of impostors try to take advantage of the Straw Hats' infamy and recruit powerful pirates for their venture into the New World. Their captain, Fake Luffy, acts like this by using Luffy's reputation (especially his rather colorful heritage) to do what he wants — since he isn't the real Luffy, he's a bastard, but not an actual <em>entitled</em> bastard. It's one of the main reasons why Sentoumaru was able to tell they were fakes; taking advantage of his reputation to bully civilians is something the real Luffy would <em>never</em> do. The real Luffy also cares very little for his heritage, to the point that he seems completely unaware of it at times.
<ul><li> The World Nobles. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ironically, Donquixote Doflamingo, a <em>former</em> World Noble, is probably the worst of the lot. His actions boil down to him having a thirty-year long temper tantrum over the fact he was not allowed to return to Mariejois just because his father decided to uproot their family and make them live as commoners. That would be a mistake, as the country they moved to (which was completely unaffiliated with the World Government) found out about their status and, being victims of the World Nobles' cruelty, decided to take their revenge on them knowing that there would be no repercussions. While he does have a genuinely tragic past, that is no excuse for his deplorable actions. And — something that is frequently pointed out out-of-universe — it was <em>because</em> Doflamingo kept on acting like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">Spoiled Brat</a> that the citizens were tipped off about their heritage in the first place.</span>

Every single book she's ever written (such as <em>"Needy Baby, Greedy Baby"</em> is essentially a character assassination on Leonard, just for wanting normal motherly love. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">She couldn't be bothered to tell Leonard that she and his father were getting a divorce,</a> and yet she feels it unfair that the son she spent over thirty years emasculating and his wife Penny, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObnoxiousInLaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObnoxiousInLaws">whom she has done nothing but talk down to</a>, didn't invite her to their wedding.

He makes ridiculous demands that have to be followed to the letter, such as making Leonard drive him wherever and whenever he wants, and participate in activities that only Sheldon finds appealing. If he gets called out on his selfish behavior, Sheldon will have a fit where he will explain why everyone else has to cater to his genius intellect, and why he has no such responsibility to care about anyone else.
</li><li> Penny herself behaves like this sometimes. There are a number of instances where she doesn't realise that after she dumps Leonard, he is no longer obligated to pay for her food...or gas...or rent...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">but he does it anyway</a>.

She helps herself to one of Sheldon's onion rings and refuses to get out of Sheldon's seat, so he kicks her out of the apartment. She then refuses to serve Sheldon at The Cheesecake Factory, so Sheldon complains to the manager, which he does have the right to do, because of Penny's bad customer service. Penny then tampers with Sheldon's food again and later throws a tantrum because Sheldon cut off her access to his Wifi.

He continually whinges that he isn't being given enough power, land or money compared to his brothers, even after <em>twice</em> having been forgiven for rising up against King Edward IV. The latter occasion triggered another brief but bloody civil war that saw tens of thousands killed (including the kingmaker Warwick), his brothers forced into exile, and Queen Elizabeth stuck in sanctuary while bringing up a new baby.

Tori even points this out to her. Jade responds by promising to treat her better in the future, which never happens.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren">Married... with Children</a></em> Peg is this trope in spades. She freely spends more money than Al makes on frivolous items and blames him for not making enough money even though she contributes less than nothing to the household. This even goes to their sex life where she expects sex despite showing no respect towards Al and doing nothing to deserve it. Even when they do have sex she emasculates Al for not being good enough despite the fact it's her personality that makes him not wanna put in any effort.

She makes Chris popular, only for Chris to cheat on her and ruin her reputation. She asks Meg for help in knocking Chris down a peg, despite the fact that she has ruthlessly bullied Meg for <em>years</em> both on and off-screen; Meg points out that she has no reason to help Connie after everything she's done and tells her to screw off... but changes her mind after Chris throws a javelin into her shoulder for laughs.
