<ul><li> This happens at a pretty young age to Coco in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Basquash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Basquash">Basquash!</a></em>. After suffering a traumatic leg injury at the hands of a mecha, she became wheelchair-bound and unable to continue playing basketball, which is part of what kicks off the series' story.
</li><li> Invoked and subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> with Tatsuki, who broke her arm after getting into the top eight in a fighting competition between girls of her age group, but still managed to earn second place despite the injury. She says that had it not been for the broken arm, she could have won the whole thing.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em>, Doburoku Sakaki blew his chance at a professional sports career when he injured himself while recklessly trying to finish the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Death March</a> by himself. He seems to take it in fairly good stride, though and respects the drive and camaraderie of the Devil Bats.
</li><li> This is how the plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ICouldntBecomeAHeroSoIReluctantlyDecidedToGetAJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ICouldntBecomeAHeroSoIReluctantlyDecidedToGetAJob">I Couldn't Become a Hero, So I Reluctantly Decided to Get a Job</a></em> starts off. The protagonist Raul was the top of his class to become a hero, only for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">demon king</a> to kick the bucket. With peace brought into the world, the hero business was closed down and he's forced to work as a retail sales clerk, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">unable to find a job with abilities that he can't use in any other businesses.</a>
</li><li> An example outside of sports: Oji Tanaka, the protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLegendOfBlackHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLegendOfBlackHeaven">The Legend of Black Heaven</a></em>, was the guitarist for the titular heavy metal band. They had a single hit, and the group then drifted apart for reasons even they can't describe. Oji, now a browbeaten middle-management <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Salaryman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Salaryman">salaryman</a> with an unaccommodating family, is deeply bitter about his life as it is and as it could have been.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MawaruPenguindrum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MawaruPenguindrum">Mawaru-Penguindrum</a></em> provides another music example. Double H, the two idol singers that are all over the place, were originally Triple H before Himari's illness forced her to quit the band.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SilverNina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SilverNina">Silver Nina</a>:</em> In his high school days, Shutaro wanted to hit it big and own his own company. Ten years after graduating, however, he's forced to return to his small hometown in failure and poverty, kicking off the plot as he becomes his niece Nina's primary caretaker.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SlamDunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SlamDunk">Slam Dunk</a></em>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a> for Mitsui Hisashi is this. In junior high school basketball, he's an MVP. He's surely on the way to repeat such feats in high school... then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury">Game-Breaking Injury</a> kicked in. As he watched his friend Akagi get most of the glories in his place, Mitsui left the basketball court, bitter with the sport and become a delinquent. Subverted 2 years later, when he's given a chance to redeem himself and be a contender; a great contender he becomes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhTheMoviePyramidOfLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhTheMoviePyramidOfLight">Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light</a></em>, Joey distracts a number of duelists who want to challenge Yugi so that he can escape. When Yugi comes back and asks if the coast is clear, the duelists all charge at him and run over Joey and Tristen. Tristen tells Joey that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">respect him alright</a>, while Joey just mumbles that he could have been a contender.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ZombieLandSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ZombieLandSaga">Zombie Land Saga</a></em> takes this to its furthest extreme with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singer</a> Ai Mizuno, who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighVoltageDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighVoltageDeath">killed by a freak lightning strike</a> right around the time she'd risen to the top of the charts and sold her first CD. Once she's reanimated as a zombie, she discovers that the world has largely moved on without her, remembering her more for her untimely death than her accomplishments in life, while she is unable to return to a society that would fear and shun her as an undead monster if she were to step into the light of day again. Her character arc is about her finding her second wind with Franchouchou, an idol group of zombies disguised as the living, once she gets over the sheer absurdity of the situation.

<ul><li> In the 'Club of Heroes' arc in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GrantMorrisonsBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GrantMorrisonsBatman">run on</a> <em>Batman</em>, several of the Batmen of All Nations have fallen prey to this since the team-up which could have propelled them to international prominence and fame sputtered out after two meetings, one of which Batman himself didn't bother to show up for. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Wingman</span>, however, suffers most of all, since his bitterness at being denied what he sees as his chance to be in the big leagues leads to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> in that arc. Batman, naturally, is scathing:
<div class="indent"><strong>Batman:</strong> You don't understand. We don't do what we do for <em>fame</em>. How much were you paid to throw away your <em>morals</em>?
</div></li><li> It's common to portray many of Batman's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery">Rogues Gallery</a> as frustrated geniuses undone by trauma and external malice. Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, and Scarecrow are seen as individuals with enough scientific talent that they can contribute legitimately to society, but instead use their abilities for evil schemes.
</li><li> Batman himself often thinks that his parents will see him as having wasted his considerable potential becoming a crime fighter when he could have done far more for the world as a scientist, engineer and intellectual, skills he displays as Batman but conceals as "Bruce Wayne" to avoid drawing attention. This is, of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>, and some have Bruce Wayne as far more active and less of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit">Upper-Class Twit</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> annuals gave the Sandman an entire story built on this idea, complete with reference to <em>On the Waterfront</em>. One of the highlights was ruining his potential football career by fixing a game in high school (to help a friend square a mob debt, no less).
<ul><li> Ultimate Spider-Man portrays scientists like Doctor Octavious and Shocker this way. Genuinely brilliant scientists and technicians who as a result of circumstances end up becoming villains.
</li><li> For a long time in the comics, many saw Peter Parker as this. A science prodigy as a high school student who makes a living as a freelance photographer and was traditionally seen as the underachiever in his social circle. The fact that by his mid-20s he kept having the same life as his high school days (balancing his Aunt, his relationships, his rent, his superhero work) only cemented this. Recently, writers have made him a CEO of his own corporation specifically to challenge this idea, and also to update the setting since it strains credibility for Spider-Man to remain poor and struggling and <em>still</em> operate in a contemporary New York of high student loans, high rent and constant expenses.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Preacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Preacher">Preacher</a></em>, Jesse Custer becomes the sheriff of Salvation. His key officer is a woman who was going to join the Army, but her mother fell ill and she stayed to look after her.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> keeps thinking of how he could have saved the world and humanity with his great intellect if not for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman">Superman</a>, and that he actually hates developing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponsOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponsOfMassDestruction">Weapons Of Mass Destruction</a> and other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> devices. This is repeatedly shown as a self-delusion, however, and both in Pre-Crisis and Post-Crisis stories, Superman has contempt for Luthor for wasting his genius on petty schemes when he could have saved the world years ago if he wanted.

This decision ended with him being arrested, charged, and convicted with assault in a rigged trial. The legal proceedings made him miss the U.A. Entrance Exam while his new criminal record all but ensures that getting a job at any Hero Office will be all but impossible. Subverted in that he ultimately doesn't regret what he did despite the consequences of his actions. He completely gets over it after he realizes that he would have left all of his new friends to suffer under Kamoshida's thumb if he had never come to Shujin, allowing him to finally move on from his forlorn wish and look towards what he's able to do now as a Phantom Thief.
</li><li> After they beat back the newly emerging New Horde in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/SheRaInTheWake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/SheRaInTheWake">She-Ra: In The Wake</a></em>, Hordak still feels like a failure, having needed help in fighting what he views as the person who usurped his accomplishments away from him.

After winning his first world title he's portrayed as a paper champion in the third before coming back and then having a forced retirement due to blunt-force trauma from the fourth.

</li><li> After her little brother Jaehaerys became king (and generally held to be the <em>best</em> king Westeros ever had), Queen Rhaena spent the rest of her life grumbling about how he and his sister-wife "stole" the throne from her, even though she spent all her time in seclusion, had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">No Social Skills</a> even before the massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">Trauma Conga Line</a> that followed her marriage, and never showed any interest in actually ruling to begin with.

She assumes that Holland is going to major in pre-law, and won't let Holland tell her otherwise.

<ul><li> Cyrus Beene is one of the greatest political minds in America and by all rights a man that should've been President. Unfortunately, Cyrus isn't particularly physically attractive and an unhappy marriage made him come to the realization that he was gay. The former made the Presidency improbable — the latter made it a pipe dream, so Cyrus had to settle for Chief of Staff (all the power, none of the glory). Though he didn't voice it often, it's clear that he's very bitter about it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Essentially, Season Six was him making one last stab at that pipe dream, saying just the right words to manipulate Luna Vargas into doing the dirty work for him</span>.

She gave that all up for her marriage to Fitz in hopes of becoming First Lady. While that did happen, considering what it cost her, it's obvious some part of Mellie regrets choosing Fitz at all. Mellie even admits that real reason she stuck around after years of a dead marriage and finding out that her husband was cheating on her was in hopes that Fitz would make it up to her by helping her with her own political ambitions, making all the sacrifices worth it because it <em>had to be</em>.

Marcus is a top-notch detective and his cooperation with Sherlock has produced spectacular results. However, Sherlock realizes that Marcus's career has become too tightly tied to Sherlock. When Captain Gregson retires, the new captain might have a less enlightened view of police consultants like Sherlock and Joan, so they would be forced to move and Marcus's career would likely be sidelined. To void this, Sherlock passes Marcus's file to a friend in the US Marshall Service who's more than happy to offer Marcus a job. Becoming a US Marshall would be an ideal job for Marcus and would allow him to progress his career. Marcus is not happy with the meddling but admits that if he did not take the US Marshall job he would probably regret it for the rest of his life.
<ul><li> Sherlock discovers that a former Scotland Yard Detective Inspector is sabotaging Marcus Bell's transfer to the US Marshall Service as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy">Revenge by Proxy</a> against Sherlock. Sherlock does not know what he might have done to turn the man into an enemy and is surprised to learn that this trope is the reason for the feud. During his final days as a Scotland Yard consultant Sherlock was barred from going to crime scenes due to his drug-addled behavior but he nevertheless barged his way into the investigation of the murder of a Member of Parliament and solved it with a brilliant deduction in a few minutes. The Inspector was the lead investigator on the case and was responsible for tying up loose ends after Sherlock identified the killer. The Inspector quickly discovered that there was enough physical evidence to solve the case even without Sherlock's help. He could have solved the case himself within a day and reaped all the glory for himself. He figures that if he was allowed to solve the case on his own, the prestige of closing such a prominent case so quickly would have earned him a promotion and led to a stellar career at Scotland Yard. Instead, he was upstaged by Sherlock and is now teaching a criminal statistics course at a US college.

Still, he was pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFace">the face</a> of TNA, rather than the soon-to-be face of ROH, until he kept being shoved to the side in favor of former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> wrestlers, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinNash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinNash">Kevin Nash</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottHall">Scott Hall</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffHardy">Jeff Hardy</a>.

Eventually, Joe would follow AJ, Daniels, and Kazarian by leaving the company, and would go on to sign a full-time deal with the WWE.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Chyna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Chyna">Chyna</a>. To Chyna, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon">Stephanie McMahon</a> is to blame for her fall from grace.

</li><li> A downplayed example would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a>, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> commented on during a promo right before the WWE and World Heavyweight Championships were unified in late 2013. Cena was actually <em>fourth choice</em> to be the face of the company. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar">Brock Lesnar</a> was first choice, but after he left, the company turned their attention to Orton, leading to his first major push, where he defeated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisBenoit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisBenoit">Chris Benoit</a> <em>clean</em> to win the World Heavyweight Championship and was promptly kicked out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Evolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Evolution">Evolution</a>. (Un)fortunately, the reign was cut short, due to a variety of factors: a still inexperienced Orton wasn't over enough with the crowd as a heel to really get cheered as a face, but what really sealed the deal was Orton's poor backstage behavior, including one rumor where he wrecked a hotel room in a fit of drunken rage. While Orton continued to have a steady push, his backstage attitude prevented him from becoming the face of the company, at which point they turned their attention to the third and fourth choices, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista">Batista</a> and Cena, respectively, before settling on the latter when he proved to be the most popular.

Teddy had everything in the world going for him — and that became his downfall. As far as backstage attitudes go, Teddy made the above-mentioned Orton look like a <em>saint</em>. He was so bad that WWE released him <em>twice</em> due to his bad behavior. Over the years since then, Teddy has been similarly fired and blackballed from nearly every major wrestling promotion in North America, with more than one promotion admitting to firing him for his own safety, as their respective locker rooms were that close to lynching him alive. More than one fan has lamented how much Teddy has wasted his talents over the years.

He was a star high school running back that brought Arlen High to the Texas state championships, but a busted ankle pretty much ended his chances for the NFL. It's likely that his failure is why he's pushing sports and other activities toward his son. Nevertheless, Hank ended up content with selling propane and propane accessories.

</li><li> This is also true of some of the women characters. Marge Simpson while a dedicated housewife, occasionally wonders about what she gave up to be with Homer, Edna Krabbappel laments her poor love life and her boring job teaching disinterested fourth graders at a terrible school.

Said actions eventually resulted in his murder, when after years of abusive training Lance snapped and turned a .38 on him.
</li><li> Todd Marinovich, who briefly played for the Los Angeles Raiders. His dad, Marv Marinovich, was a coulda-been himself and resolved to train Todd from an early age to be the perfect athlete. It almost worked, and Marinovich seemed set for a lengthy professional career. The problem was that his sheltered upbringing - he had been forbidden from eating chocolates or takeaway food - failed him when he left home for college, and he quickly transformed into a drunk party animal who spent his free time smoking dope. He had enough residual strength and talent to last a year in the NFL but was eventually suspended for failing drug tests (he tried to avoid this by switching to LSD, which did nothing for his concentration). After a six-year layoff, he attempted to return to professional football, but his career was permanently derailed by injury and a new heroin habit. Frustratingly, he was still capable of producing good results, right up until the end of his career.
</li><li> Lenny Mancini was a promising and talented young boxer during the '30s and '40s, having actually become the # 1 contender for the world lightweight champion before he was drafted into the Army when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> broke out. He was wounded in action, and when he came back to the ring when the war ended, he simply wasn't the same. Instead, he supported his son Ray "Boom Boom" Mancini in his own boxing career, who in turn dedicated his title win to his father.
</li><li> Subverted by many people who succeeded later in life, such as <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/arts/design/20herrera.html">Carmen Herrera.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Gretel Bergmann was a world class high jumper in the 1930s, setting national records. She should have competed for her native Germany in the 1936 Games, but she was Jewish. In fact, the Germans initially let her on their team to placate the IOC and to prevent an American boycott. Once the Americans were on their way (and under the thumb of the pro-German Avery Brundage) the Nazis expelled her from the team, though she tied the German record a month before (and that height would have won her a medal in the event).
</li><li> The only two Jews on the US track-and-field team, Sam Stoller and Marty Glickman, were removed from the 4x100 relay and replaced by Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalfe. They were the only two healthy track-and-field athletes not to compete, even though their times were faster than the other two on the original team.
</li><li> Subverted by the Manning Family. While father Archie Manning was an NFL quarterback in the '70s (a good player on the abysmally bad Saints teams at the time) and both Peyton and Eli are Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks (Peyton with the Colts and Eli with the Giants), there's a third Manning brother (the oldest, actually) Cooper who was a hot prospect wide receiver in high school before a diagnosis of a spinal condition ended his career. He's not bitter about it, having gone into finance and later on getting his own football analysis show on Fox Sports.
</li><li> Jesus Chavez was a top Mexican boxing prospect whom many believed would have been the next great boxing star from México. He even gave Floyd Mayweather Jr. one of his toughest fights at the 135 division. However, that all ended when he got into a vehicular accident which permanently damaged one of his knee caps. He tried to make a comeback afterwards, but the injury clearly interfered with his boxing, forcing him to retire.
</li><li> Michael "The Force" Watson was a serious contender for the WBO Middleweight Title, getting a highly controversial loss (that the general public thought he won) against reigning champ Chris "Simply the Best" Eubank. In their rematch, he was unquestionably winning and ahead on all scorecards, beating Eubank soundly, when in the closing seconds of the 11th (out of 12) round, Eubank somehow managed to land a thunderous uppercut that left Watson dazed and groggy. When he came out for round 12, Eubank swiftly dispatched him to a TKO. Unbeknownst to everyone involved, Eubank's uppercut permanently damaged Watson's brain, sending him to a coma shortly after the match and rendering him effectively a vegetable for several months. Watson later woke up from the coma and miraculously regained his consciousness, speech, and movement over the years, but his career was finished as Watson is to this day partly paralyzed, suffering the lingering effects from that punch.
</li><li> A heartwarming variant: A New Hampshire college track star, Cameron Lyle, who registered as a potential bone marrow donor got a call that he was a match for a man with leukemia. Agreeing effectively ended his track career for the rest of his college life, but he said he'd do it again. Also rather awesome when you remember that donating bone marrow is far from painless.
</li><li> Russian gymnast Elena Mukhina, the 1978 All-Around World Champion, was considered one of the stars of the Russian team, and had a pretty good shot at a medal in the 1980 Moscow Olympics. Two weeks before the Games, Mukhina had a catastrophic fall while attempting a dangerous roll-out skill and was paralyzed from the neck down. (The skill and all other similar skills were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">later banned</a> because of the potential for serious injury.) However, by this point Mukhina was so fed up with her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">brutal training regimen</a> that, far from being upset at missing her shot, she was actually relieved that she wouldn't be going to the Olympics.
</li><li> Similarly, American Julissa Gomez was considered a potential contender for a spot on the 1988 US Olympic Team, but broke her neck in a vaulting accident at a smaller competition in May of that year. Though she was initially aware and responsive following the accident, Gomez was accidentally disconnected from her ventilator while in the hospital, and the lack of oxygen caused her to lapse into a vegetative state. She died three years later, never regaining consciousness.
</li><li> In a less extreme example, any number of athletes have lost their chance at the Olympics because of an ill-timed injury. Since the Olympics occur only once every four years, even if the injury wasn't career-ending, that sometimes turns out to be their <em>only</em> chance at an Olympics, because an athlete who was in the prime of their career leading up to one Olympics may be past his or her peak by the time the next Games comes around. (This is especially true in some sports, like women's gymnastics, where <em>most</em> athletes' peaks are a few years at most.)

<ul><li> The most famous example, in English history, is Edward the Black Prince, heir to King Edward III, a key commander at the Battle of Crecy during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHundredYearsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHundredYearsWar">The Hundred Years War</a>, seen by many as the "flower of chivalry".

</li><li> In the case of Indian history, the great example is the Mughal Prince Dara Shikoh (son of Shah Jahan of Taj Mahal fame). Dara Shikoh was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaithSmoothie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaithSmoothie">Interfaith Smoothie</a>, who translated the Gita from Sanskrit into Persian. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingYinYang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingYinYang">Aurangzeb was a religious fanatic</a>. As a result of the Mughal's fratricidal succession policy, Aurangzeb went in rebellion against his father and his brother, leading to Dara's death. Aurangzeb's conquests created widespread resentment against the Mughals, leading to many revolts and breakaway kingdoms, marking the end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenAge">Golden Age</a> of medieval India, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes">the decline of the Mughal Empire, the power vacuum of the 1700s that would eventually be exploited by the East India Company and greater religious intolerance</a>.

The historian Jules Michelet especially lamented the downfall of Louis Antoine de Saint-Just. At the age of 25, he entered politics and in his less-than-two-year career, he was co-author of the constitution of 1793, introduced wealth redistribution measures, won the respect of troops while serving as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePoliticalOfficer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePoliticalOfficer">The Political Officer</a>, he reorganized the Army of the Rhine from defeat to victory. His association and loyalty to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaximilienRobespierre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaximilienRobespierre">Maximilien Robespierre</a> led to his death at the age of 27. He would serve as an inspiration for young revolutionaries everywhere and he inspired Enjolras in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables">Les Misérables</a>. Michelet even went as far to assert that had Saint-Just lived, the rise of Napoleon might well have been averted, and R. R. Palmer wrote of him:
<div class="indent"><em>This young man is one of the mysteries of the Revolution.

He was a Protestant who was popular and liked by Catholic Irish, sought to create consensus for Home Rule in the Parliament and he was a partial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker">Trope Maker</a> of the "Boycott" protest tactic<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0b63w');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0b63w" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0b63w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Named after an English land agent Charles Boycott who was ruthlessly preying on poor tenants. In order to make a protest, Parnell proposed to his constituents that they refuse to treat Boycott socially, refuse to work on his lands, and refuse to sell or treat him socially in any way, with Boycott's name becoming a verb. This protest was used in many non-violent resistance movements, most notably in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India">India</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthAfrica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthAfrica">South Africa</a> and is still a major part of the global protest toolkit and lexicon</span>. He was regarded by historian A. J. P. Taylor as a founder for Irish nationalism. Yet, Parnell's career was undone by a sex scandal which led him to be abandoned by the fragile coalition that was kept around him, with the Catholic clergy especially abandoning him, creating divides between them and the Liberal Republican (such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesJoyce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesJoyce">James Joyce</a> who kept referring to Parnell in his books in a very positive, even hagiographic, manner). Parnell is seen as the one politician who could have healed the Catholic-Protestant Divide and many in Ireland and England think that if his career was not disgraced, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheIrishRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheIrishRevolution">The Irish Revolution</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles">The Troubles</a> could have been avoided entirely.

</li><li> The history of Ancient Rome and Greece offers several examples:
<ul><li> What would history have been like had Hannibal Barca conquered Rome? Or if Queen Boudicca liberated Britain? Or Spartacus triumphed in the Third Servile War? Of if Arminius succeeded in uniting Germany into a counter-Empire of Rome as he envisioned? Could Hannibal have sustained and consolidated his conquests and then built and ruled a united Carthago-Roman Empire? Could Britain have maintained its matriarchal traditions and become a proto-feminist Kingdom? Could slavery have been abolished in the classical world? The spectacular, prodigious displays of talent in these individuals brief careers, have made them a favorite of alternate historians and novelists.

His seven-year reign and victory over Queen Zenobia potentially extended the lifetime of the Empire. Another example, more well-known than Aurelian, is the emperor Julian the Apostate, famous for his attempts to halt the rise of Christianity. He is cited by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GoreVidal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GoreVidal">Gore Vidal</a> as a figure who could have preserved Rome's multi-religious and secular culture and halted the hegemony of Christianity, as well as provide competent, administrative reform across the Empire. He reigned for two years before dying in battle against the Parthian Empire. Mike Duncan, while skeptical of Julian, admits that he's someone "we'll never stop talking about".
</li></ul></li><li> Dave Mustaine was kicked out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a> shortly before they became famous. Although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Megadeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Megadeth">Megadeth</a> is still a respected and fairly well-known band, it's nowhere near as popular as Metallica.
</li><li> In the mid-'90s, people thought that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaytonFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaytonFamily">Dayton Family</a> was going to be the next big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangstaRap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangstaRap">gangsta rap</a> group. However, they were derailed by legal troubles and never made it out of their underground fanbase in Flint, Michigan.
</li><li> R&amp;B singer <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Jones_(radio_personality)">Miss Jones<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> had a lot of buzz in the mid-'90s after her guest appearance on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nas">Nas</a>' <em>Sugar Hill</em>, especially since she was a singer's singer. However, a lot of setbacks (as well as a reportedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">bad attitude</a>) derailed her music career. She went into DJing after that, hosting the morning show on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity">New York City</a> rap station Hot 97, before she got fired from the station over the song <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD6zcN4V4R4">"USA for Indonesia"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, aka the Tsunami Song<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note109xw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note109xw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note109xw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The linked version starts with four minutes of Miss Jones ranting at her co-host Miss Info, who happened to be of Korean descent and personally offended by the song's racist lyrics, which caused her to walk off the air in disgust. None of Miss Jones' comments towards Miss Info helped her case.</span>, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockJock">mocked the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami</a>. She's now a DJ for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Philadelphia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> radio station.
</li><li> Subverted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ConwayTwitty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ConwayTwitty">Conway Twitty</a>. Baseball was his second passion and he received an offer to play for the Philadelphia Phillies but he was drafted into the Army. After Conway <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReturningWarVet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReturningWarVet">got out of the service</a>, he made it big as a country singer; country music was actually his first passion.
</li><li> Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino is the considered the greatest Filipino politician who never became president, but even before his assassination, he said his long imprisonment caused him to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaithTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaithTurn">HeelFaith Turn</a> and made him quit politics.
</li><li> This trope is the reason why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RobertFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RobertFKennedy">Robert F. Kennedy</a> are seen as icons by American liberals. John was a famously photogenic President who proposed a series of massive anti-poverty and infrastructure programs called the "New Frontier", while Robert, as John's Attorney General, was his brother's most trusted advisor and a key player in his campaigns for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CivilRightsMovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CivilRightsMovement">civil rights</a> and against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">The Mafia</a>. Wondering how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> and beyond would have turned out had they not been assassinated is probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">the most popular</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a> scenario of modern, postwar American history, and a big part of the reason why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoShotJFK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoShotJFK">so many conspiracy theories</a> circulate around their deaths.
</li><li> After she made the cover of Time at the age of eighteen around the time <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrettyInPink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrettyInPink">Pretty in Pink</a></em> was released, big things were expected of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MollyRingwald" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MollyRingwald">Molly Ringwald</a>, who had made a splash with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SixteenCandles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SixteenCandles">Sixteen Candles</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBreakfastClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBreakfastClub">The Breakfast Club</a></em>. However, an acrimonious split with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnHughes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnHughes">John Hughes</a> failed attempts to gain more respect as a young actress, and her own personal crises led to her career going downhill by the end of the eighties. Since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSecretLifeOfTheAmericanTeenager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSecretLifeOfTheAmericanTeenager">The Secret Life of the American Teenager</a></em>, she's mainly been playing smaller parts, particularly mothers or mother figures, for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">an easy paycheck.</a> The remnants of her fanbase aren't exactly pleased with what she's become.
