Once she joins the harem, she buys out their high school to become the "chairwoman" so as to spend time with him, despite having no teaching credentials.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoysOverFlowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoysOverFlowers">Boys over Flowers</a></em>, the parentage of the student body of Eitoku Academy is implied to almost entirely be made up of ridiculously wealthy people, and the F4 are the cream of the crop.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardCaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardCaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em>: Tomoyo, Sakura's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggleBestFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggleBestFriend">Muggle Best Friend</a>, is absolutely <em>loaded</em>.

</li><li> The five girls of <em>Debutante Detective Squad</em> are said to each have wealth greater than the annual gross national product of Japan.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, the Briefs family owns the Capsule Corporation. Capsules are a perfect miniaturization technology, and the Briefs have a monopoly. The exact extent of their wealth isn't made completely clear. However, their mansion is so huge it has its own internal forests, and building a spaceship to meet their friends' interstellar travel needs, free of charge, is apparently a trivial act. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> also says their company <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">owns half of the worldwide vehicle market</a>, and they also sell everything from refrigerators to houses.
<ul><li> Taken to extremes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, where Bulma owns a private cruise ship large enough to house an entire literal <em>castle</em> with room to spare.

The cost for these "wishes" are automatically billed against a 10 billion yen limit (that's about $100 million). And all of it was arranged by the mysterious "Mr. Outside", who can apparently just give 12 people 10 billion yen <em>each</em> without it mattering overly much.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Golgo13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Golgo13">Golgo 13</a></em> charges three million dollars a job, and has done <em>at least</em> one job a month, every month, since 1968 (and that's assuming there aren't more assignments that aren't in the manga).

</li><li> The Kuramitsu family owns garden planets, as in planets for the sole purpose of the family and friends to spend nice weekends at. And their wealth is petty change compared to the Emperor. Given the Kuramitsu clan is royalty of the Jurai's rival empire of Seniwa, it's hardly surprising.

The distraught salesman frets that he's ruined, RUINED... until he looks down at the $500,000 check.

The trio is in awe of the stupendous mansion when they finally arrive, only to be told it's a <em>dog house</em> (for <em>one</em> Growlthe) and the real house dwarfs it. A few seasons later, we find out it's not the only property they own, and while the others are modest in comparison, they're still extremely lavish.
</li><li> The Unyuu family from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SketDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SketDance">Sket Dance</a></em> is so wealthy that they have an entire city built underneath their already vast mansion, because there's not enough space on the surface. Furthermore, their house is practically self-sufficient, and has its own synthetic weather system, farms, malls, etc. Mimori claims that her family's assets are worth 5 quadrillion yen (approximately 47 trillion USD, or almost <em>10 times</em> the entire nation of Japan's GDP).

</li><li> In <em>The Green Team: Boy Millionaires</em>, the only prerequisite for joining the Green Team is one million dollars. The boys paid fortunes to anyone who could offer them a worthy adventure. In their first and only (at the time) published story, they funded the "Great American Pleasure Machine", a sort of roller coaster ride that brings so much pleasure, it drives the villain of the piece insane. As a text page in <em>1st Issue Special</em> #2 (May 1975) explained, their jumpsuit uniforms had many pockets for money, with special locks, and they carried ticker-tape wristwatches, a chain of keys that would unlock any of their many labs and money vaults in far-flung lands, and a quarter-million dollars each that any of them could whip out at any time in the name of adventure.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Superman">Superman</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a>, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>.

Lois Lane calculates Luthor's income and determines that he won't stop to pick up a $100 bill from the ground, because it's not worth one second of his time.

This is backed up in story by having his own private island made for him (complete with secret base), inventing an automatic mental Twitter, and in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">Moment of Awesome</a>, buying <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Japan — yes, the entire country — to rebuild it.</span> Do anything indeed.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> tend to get a few of these too. Some are technical qualifiers such as Starfire being an Alien Princess who doesn't typically tap her stuff from her home due to being captured or exiled several times depending on when. However, in the 2000's, when they were just The Titans, they ended up bankrolling themselves this time, so that brought 2 big investors to the team. First was Jesse Quick, who ran her own company and managed to fight crime in her spare time. And second was the former Aqualad who became Tempest. He goes the route of finding sunken treasure to bankroll stuff. So much so they're able to create an enormous hologram of Titans Tower as well as an underground base without breaking a sweat.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Aquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Aquaman">Aquaman</a></em>, although it's not a major part of his character. When he's King of Atlantis, he has his own treasury, and when he's desposed for the nth time, he makes ends meet with his personal secret hoard of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PirateBooty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PirateBooty">pirate treasure</a>. It's a common habit of his to pay in reaturants with solid gold doubloons.
</li></ul></li><li> They're no stranger to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a>, either:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHercules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHercules">The Incredible Hercules</a></em>, the title character is able to purchase entire bars with gold he has in his pocket, and his diverse portfolio requires two superheroes a full week to even gather, let alone settle, in the wake of his (temporary) demise. One example alone that qualifies for this list: he was one of the initial investors in Stark Enterprises, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">whose founder</a> is listed below. When the size of the investment was calculated, a <em>second line of zeroes</em> was required. Assuming 1.25 inch margins on each side of the page and a 12-point font, this investment would come to at least 10 novemdecillion (10^61) dollars. (Though after the fourth novemdecillion dollars, who's really counting?)
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em>, Anthony (Tony) Edward Stark. Even without any funds, he's a gadgeteer genius who managed to build the Iron Man suit out of, basically, tin cans and string. That said, having loads of <em>spare</em> suits, many built in a lab in his own house most definitely counts. As does having a fully automated production facility in his garage that can build him another one in 5 hours. Case in point: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> thinks they should all get armor. <a class="urllink" href="http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c166/Ennead13x/Western%20Comic/Picture1-1.png">Tony's response?<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> And in <em>Mini-Marvels</em> Tony <em>does</em> give everyone powered armor just to prove how awesome he is. He also keeps fully working versions of previous armors in a trophy room, has destroyed them to keep them out of enemy hands, and apparently rebuilt them for the unlikely occasions when they'd come in useful in the future. Tony's ridiculous fortune is lampshaded in the pages of <em>Avengers</em> Vol. 4:
<div class="indent"><strong>Steve Rogers:</strong> "I thought you were broke."
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Iron Man:</strong> "<strong>My</strong> broke is not the same as <strong>your</strong> broke."
</div><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></em> can be quite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructiveSaviour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructiveSaviour">Destructive Saviours</a>. When buildings get knocked over, streets get blown up, and cars get pitched at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot">Killer Robots</a>, who gets the bill? And never misses that money? That <em>alone</em> would make Tony one of the more impressive examples.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUltimates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUltimates">Ultimate Iron Man</a>, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Marvel</a> universe, is as rich and wealthy as mainstream Iron Man. He also has an evil brother, Gregory Stark, and they grew up with a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingRivalry">Sibling Rivalry</a>. Whatever Tony did, Gregory always did something better. Including, of course, raising an even higher fortune of his own. Their rivalry grew into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel">Cain and Abel</a> levels in <em>Ultimate Avengers vs. New Ultimates</em>, and he died at the end of the conflict. And his huge fortune? It was inherited by his closest living relative... Tony Stark!
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ProfessorX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ProfessorX">Charles Xavier</a>'s inherited fortune made him able to turn the basement of a mansion into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateUndergroundBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateUndergroundBase">Elaborate Underground Base</a> with an absurdly advanced holodeck room, as well as building various vehicles, including helicopters and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane">a really advanced jet</a>. Plus the Cerebro. Those can't come cheap. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2y1kb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2y1kb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2y1kb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Although, with Magneto's help, all labor costs would pretty much become zero, meaning he's only really paying for parts. At least during the times when Magneto was his ally and not his arch-enemy.</span>
<ul><li> Eventually, his even richer girlfriend, Shi'Ar Empress Lilandra (who owned an entire <em>galaxy</em>) provided upgrades to much of Xavier's facilities.
</li><li> Note that the jet in question was a custom-modified SR-71 Blackbird, bought straight from Lockheed. Lockheed in real life never sold Blackbirds to anyone except the US government, since the technology was largely top secret. This illustrates that Xavier is both ludicrously rich and even more ludicrously well-connected. Or he just used his psychic powers to convince whoever was responsible to get him what he needed.
</li><li> Also, <em>everything</em> on this list — Cerebro, the mansion, the Blackbird, and other smaller planes and helicopters — gets destroyed whenever the plot requires them not to have it or wants to show "this villain is serious." And <em>everything</em> on this list will be replaced, often with a better version that more closely matches whatever it looks like in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFilmSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFilmSeries">the most recent film</a>, by the next time it's needed. This in addition to the sprawling facilities and Star Trek-level gadgetry. That places Professor X in Tony Stark's tier, but unlike the other characters with unlimited resources, we never hear about his business ventures, or trouble with any companies of his during the times Xavier is in space or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookDeath">believed by all to be dead</a>. Was his dad <em>so</em> rich that the X-Men can keep this up indefinitely without it being replenished, or is there an unseen Xavier Industries comparable to what Bruce Wayne or Tony Stark has?
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmmaFrost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmmaFrost">Emma Frost</a> (who herself is a case: she's grown wealthy, and inherited the family business even if she ran away from home <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily">for her own safety</a>) is known to have used her telepathy to get insider information for playing the stock market. Given that in his younger years, Xavier was decidedly less ethical about invading (and even altering) people's minds, one wonders if he did the same thing in order to enhance his wealth. Simply being heavily invested in other people's companies could give Xavier vast wealth without having to run a company of his own, if he picked the right companies.
</li></ul></li><li> Angel's no slouch either. While his fortune is not flaunted to the degree that Tony Stark's is, he's able to say "Oh, don't worry, I'll just write a check" to expenditures that would boggle the mind. He's also financed several of the teams he's been a part of (such as the Champions, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDefenders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDefenders">New Defenders</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor">X-Factor</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XForce">X-Force</a>) out of his own pocket.
</li><li> Reed Richards of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a>.</em> Again, you can miss it because it's not part of his character like Tony (or even Angel, who flaunts it <em>some</em>), but it's there. The Baxter Building is huge and super-luxurious, and the materials needed to make his many tools and vehicles and scientific equipment don't grow on trees (and sometimes require <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtanium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtanium">Unobtanium</a> that is ridiculously hard to come by.) Making another of something that blows up is <em>never</em> a problem, and he'll always pull out bigger and better versions of any of the team's signature gear. Basically, it turns out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless">Reed Richards is NOT useless</a>, and money from selling inventions that don't endanger the planet (sorry, no pocket Negative Zone portals) as well as the Four's celebrity status (they get cash from every film, action figure, etc.) has made him rich enough that a trivial little problem like "doing this would require ten times the amount of money that exists in the world" will <em>never</em> hold the Four back. Reed is so rich that he rakes in more money than the entire US GDP.
</li><li> Oneshot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cable">Cable</a> foe Jackie Singapore is noted to be richer than both Stark and Bill Gates, and 17% of Singapore's population thinks the country is named after <em>him</em>. It's also implied that entire countries make decisions based on his word, and that he can, among other things, get the two Koreas to actually agree on something.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn">Norman Osborn</a>/Green Goblin is so rich and well connected that he can get himself out of any charges as the Goblin, get a political position with ease, and form his own evil SHIELD army, HAMMER.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> villain Arcade is so rich that, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersArena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersArena">Avengers Arena</a></em>, he personally bankrolls the construction of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathCourse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathCourse">Death Course</a> the size of a small country, locates it on a private island off the coast of Antarctica, and packs it with so much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkesThirdLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkesThirdLaw">ridiculously advanced technology</a> that he is essentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> within its borders. In an early appearance, Arcade is able to steal Shi'ar technology from the Xavier Mansion, but having a sample of alien super-tech is one thing. Having the resources to reverse-engineer and duplicate it requires serious cash. Especially on the scale that Arcade does it. And prior to <em>Avengers Arena</em>, Arcade has been doing the same thing for decades on a smaller scale with dozens of iterations of "Murderworld". Whenever superheroes shut him down in one city, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney">buys his way out of jail time</a> (whether through hiring top lawyers or just outright bribery is never specified) and sets up a new Murderworld somewhere else. Every Murderworld is a combination <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateUndergroundBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateUndergroundBase">Elaborate Underground Base</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusementParkOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusementParkOfDoom">Amusement Park of Doom</a>, and he somehow has the resources to build such sprawling facilities undetected beneath <em>New York City</em>, among other places.
</li><li> Come <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllNewAllDifferentMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllNewAllDifferentMarvel">All-New, All-Different Marvel</a></em>'s relaunch, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Peter Parker</a> joins these men and women, having turned Parker Industries, a company <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan">Doc Ock started while hijacking Peter's body</a>, into a massively successful company around the globe. While he has some help with the fact that his step-uncle being John Jameson Sr. (that's J. Jonah Jameson's dad), it does give him a lot more freedom and the chance to enhance his webs. However, an interesting thing about this is that, while he does have a successful business, he's completely out of his league and has become a massive target for other foes, such as the Zodiac and the Ghost. It ultimately gets so bad that Peter ultimately decides to destroy everything to keep it out of Doctor Octopus' tentacles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretEmpire">Secret Empire</a></em>, financially destroying him.
</li><li> Roberto da Costa, a.k.a. Sunspot, is another example. His father was an extremely wealthy and influential Afro-Brazilian businessman, and when he died, Roberto inherited his company and all his wealth. While an Avenger, Roberto famously defeated A.I.M. not through violence, but by simply buying them out and firing all of their villainous higher-ups. He now funds the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewAvengers">New Avengers</a> out of his own pocket, and is not shy about flaunting his wealth to motivate his "employees"; when one of his scientists comes up with a successful plan to save the day, he rewards her by buying her a new Lexus.
</li><li> T'Challa, a.k.a. the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackPanther">Black Panther</a>, was an example until recently. T'Challa is king of Wakanda, meaning he legally controls the trade and distribution of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtainium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtainium">Vibranium</a> (Captain America's shield is made of that stuff and Adamantium), and according to the comics, Vibranium costs $10,000 <em>per gram</em>. And according to <em>Doomwar #1</em>, the Wakandan vaults have 10,000 tons of it. Do the math: it's all worth <em>$9.7 trillion</em>, more than the GPA of the nonfictional world. Unfortunately, a plot by Doctor Doom to loot the Vibranium forced T'Challa to use a failsafe that rendered the stockpile inert and potentially worthless, but that doesn't mean it will always be. While not quite as loose with his money as Iron Man or Angel, he's also used his wealth to make a few pretty significant contributions over the years. Case in point: he provided the Avengers with their first Quinjet, and continued to provide more advanced versions of the craft for a number of years.
</li><li> Danny Rand, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ImmortalIronFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ImmortalIronFist">Immortal Iron Fist</a>, is pretty fabulously wealthy too. He notably replaced Tony Stark as the bankroller of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewAvengers">New Avengers</a> during the period where they were branded fugitives after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar">Civil War</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SubMariner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SubMariner">Sub-Mariner</a> technically owns all the treasure on the sea floor (are <em>you</em> going to tell him otherwise?). If he ever needs cash, he's never found wanting.
</li><li> As Prince and sometimes King of Asgard, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">The Mighty Thor</a> is pretty well off. He once purchased an entire steel mill to forge battle armor by walking into the owner's office and dumping a bag of gold on the table, stating "The Rhinegold of myth is quite real". And years later, when Thor restored Asgard after suffering its latest "Ragnarok", he purchased a huge plot of land to place the city on, and he did this by leading the land owner into the Royal Treasure Chamber with literal <strong>MOUNTAINS</strong> of gold and precious gems, telling the man to "take whatever you want and leave". The man got help and filled his pickup truck, making no discernible dent in the treasure. Balder and even non-royals like The Warriors Three routinely buy things on Earth or make reparations for damage (or worse, pay for Volstagg's food orgies) with sacks of gold that they hand out freely.
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyMouseAndDuckComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyMouseAndDuckComics">Disney Mouse and Duck Comics</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987">DuckTales (1987)</a></em> and elsewhere, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse">Scrooge McDuck</a>'s wealth is one of his defining characteristics. He has so much money he can swim in it, which happens to be one of his favorite pastimes. He is the owner of a windowless concrete block, affectionately called The Money Bin, filled with so much cold, hard cash that the bottom layer probably collapsed into electron-degeneracy sometime in the early 1990s. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonRosa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonRosa">Don Rosa</a> makes a point that the money in the bin is what Scrooge earned <em>before</em> he became the world's richest duck.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3g6qr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3g6qr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3g6qr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Not an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyNarrowSuperlative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyNarrowSuperlative">Overly Narrow Superlative</a>—Scrooge's biggest rival in money-hoarding, Flintheart Glomgold, is also a duck, with humans not existing at all in the setting.</span> He has dozens of times more, in bank accounts and in investments, but the money in the bin is there because every coin and bill is a mark of victory to its owner; he can actually tell how he earned each one by looking at them, and would never part with one unless the story behind it is not worth remembering. As implied by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol">his name</a>, Scrooge is a satirical take on the idea that one can achieve vast wealth through nothing but obsessive penny-pinching; he always insists that (unlike his rivals) he earned it all "square," i.e. through legitimate work (though he rarely explains any of the details), and usually labels anyone who spends money on anything as a "spendthrift."
<ul><li> In one Don Rosa story it's shown that Scrooge has every federal and state organization, including the U.S. Armed Forces, at his beck and call because his taxes comprise about 90% of their income. When you put together all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks">Carl Barks</a> and Don Rosa stories, Scrooge could probably buy out every other person mentioned on this page. And yet he still figures he doesn't have enough wealth to buy even a tenth of a solid gold moon, when engaged in a trade with the wealthiest man from Venus for it. And then he trades it for a handful of dirt.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a> would probably be the only thing on this page that would give him a run for his money, no pun intended. This being a setting where your corporation IS a country, if they're not an entire continent, government, military and all and a few trillion dollars is chump change.
</li></ul></li><li> In some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks">Carl Barks</a> stories, it's stated that Scrooge can <em>not</em> transfer the money from his bin to banks because they already have so much of his money they have no place to guard more.
</li><li> In an early Carl Barks story Scrooge says that if he loses one billion dollars a minute, he'll go bankrupt in 600 years. That would be 315,576,000 billion dollars, or 315,576 quintillion dollars. Needless to say, this is astronomically more than there exists wealth in the entire world (Scrooge would lose that much in less than half a year). This is a variation of a line from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CitizenKane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CitizenKane">Citizen Kane</a></em> where it was losing a million dollars per year would lead to closing down in sixty years.
</li><li> In one story, Scrooge spends several millions of dollars merely because he has no safe place to keep them. (The Money Bin is already full, and it'd cost billions to build another one.) In the end, it's all for nothing because the money is spent on places that belong to him. He's so wealthy he can't remember all businesses he owns.
<ul><li> Although this does contradict one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987">DuckTales (1987)</a></em> where he says he has actually memorized <em>every</em> serial number on <em>every</em> piece of paper money he owns, a skill that makes him realize that the money that Ma Beagle paid him with was stolen from him. (This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>, of course, but still...)
</li><li> Another story has Scrooge getting screwed by storms on his resorts, because the insurance companies that secure the places are his as well.
</li></ul></li><li> Scrooge was the top person in the Forbes Fiction 15 for 25 years running, until he lost a round-the-world race to Flintheart Glomgold, where the prize was Scrooge's money bin. This was enough to knock Scrooge out of the Fiction 15 and put Glomgold at #2 in 2012 behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">Smaug</a>, with just the Money Bin). Total worth: 5 multiplujillion, 9 impossibidillion, 7 fantasticatrillion dollars and 16 cents. So rich, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventyZillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventyZillion">make up numbers</a> for it.
</li><li> Someone quantified it down to 25 trillion dollars in real life. Forbes put it at 65.4 billion dollars as of their last list, in 2013 (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.forbes.com/special-report/2013/fictional-15/">with Scrooge back at #1<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>).
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-hQf-F3hyU&amp;app=desktop">After extensive mathematics<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/GameTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/GameTheory">MatPat</a> calculated Scrooge's Money Bin alone to contain between $52.3 billion and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible">$333.9 trillion</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Not to be forgotten are his two billionaire rivals, Flintheart Glomgold (mostly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987">DuckTales (1987)</a></em>) and John D. Rockerduck (mostly in the comics), both of whom are trying to surpass his fortune. In the case of Rockerduck, spending a lot instead of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrooge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrooge">a tightwad like Scrooge</a>.
</li><li> In fact, especially in the European comics, Duckburg is usually portrayed as having a literal billionaire's club. Since there are usually only several hundred billionaires on the entire world, one wonders why they all decided to huddle together.
<ul><li> Most European currencies are worth quite a lot less than the American dollar, and since translations usually use the local one instead of the latter, it is often entirely plausible for a literal billionaire's club to exist in a real-life major city such as New York from that perspective. To give a couple of examples, 1 billion Polish złoty is about $270 million and 1 billion Swedish krona is about $110 million. Sometimes the numbers become ridiculously low, like in Hungary where you only need $3.6 million to get 1 billion forint, or Italy, where the popular <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PaperinikNewAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PaperinikNewAdventures">Paperinik New Adventures</a></em> comics originated and whose pre-euro currency lira made anyone able to muster up just north of half a million dollars a billionaire.

One of Regina's hobbies is collecting gemstones — not to wear for jewelry, or keep in a vault or museum, but to display on her dresser.

</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RichieRich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RichieRich">movie</a>, their wealth is stated at $70 billion, which in 1994 would put them #1 on Forbes' richest person list in a walk. (At the time, Bill Gates's net worth was about $10 billion.) It took 20 years for a single individual to break the $70 billion barrier (Carlos Helu, Jr.), and the current richest man, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has about $113 billion. This means that if the Riches were only as successful and philanthropic as Bill Gates in the past 20 years, they'd have over <em>$500 billion</em> to their name.
</li></ul></li><li> While maybe not as over the top as most others here, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics">Archie Comics</a>'s Hiram and Hermione Lodge, Veronica's parents, still rank high on the social ladder. Evidence would come from (a) Veronica's spending sprees, where she buys out whole boutiques, new cars, vacations, on a whim, and (b) the cost to repair the endless mayhem caused by Archie's visits. Also, according to <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiram_Lodge">The Other Wiki<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Veronica states that "Daddy has billions," which is likely due to the extreme rise of wealth in the real world since the introduction of the Lodges. In order to maintain the pretense that the Lodges are one of the richest in the world, her parents have to be billionaires.
<ul><li> Veronica claims that her father owns a (fictional) country.
</li><li> In an <em>Archie 3000</em> story, he buys a planet.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em>, Adrian Veidt became absurdly rich on the patent for the spark hydrants that power the electric cars of the Watchmen world. He also owns dozens of other companies, but his ultimate money-wasting venture is that of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">creating a massive "alien" creature on a private island which he then teleports into New York City and "saves the world" from</span>. Oh, and he owns a palace in Antarctica, too. The funny thing is that he was already rich as a teenager, then gave away the wealth and, starting from scratch, built a second fortune. The movie features Veidt on the cover of <em>Forbes</em> magazine, and the company included him in a "fictional 500" list of richest fictional characters on their website.

It <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">plays this trope for laughs</a> and features a character whose only trait seems to be his incredible wealth. Lord Snooty also has aspects of this trope, living in a castle and being a lord and everything, but occasionally he is very poor, even using the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalletMoths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalletMoths">Wallet Moths</a> trope. Lord Snooty's 2000s revival as Lord Snooty the Third uses this trope a lot more than the original Lord Snooty, and has never been shown to have any kind of un-absurdly-richness.

It's not uncommon for him to have more gold in his vault than exists on planet Earth, mined or still in the ground (Though thats probably more because fanfic writers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale">dont know how few gold atoms actually exist on Earth</a>, rather than to invoke this trope.) Some stories also have 'Potter family investments', which tend to be very long-term investments in very profitable companies. Though it's also common for fics to have the Potter wealth to be not nearly as large as it ought to be, on the premise that James Potter personally bankrolled the entire war against Voldemort until his murder.

</li><li> Harry finds out that he's ridiculously rich — he never really looked into the extent of the Potter vaults before, but Thor (formerly James Potter), did when he reclaimed them, with them being estimated at £1.5 billion. It helps that Potter senior was an early investor in Stark Industries (he met Howard Stark during WWII and was impressed by him) and, among other companies, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Wayne Enterprises.</a> Unlike most examples, however, neither Thor nor Harry does anything with them — Thor is Crown Prince of Asgard, so doesn't really need to and is perfectly happy to let the goblins manage his investment portfolio and Harry use the vault. Harry finds it personally embarrassing and doesn't mention it to people, unless, say, he wants to offer to replace the X-Men's heavily customised Blackbird (a casualty of the fight between Magneto and the Red Son in the second book) - which cost the equivalent of nearly $285 <em>million</em> per unit, even <em>without</em> customisation, and only 32 were ever made.

</li><li> It's also worth mentioning the previous owners of most of Smaug's treasure, the dwarves of the Lonely Mountain. Smaug never spends any of his hoard, but the dwarves were consumers and producers in a market society, and they lived under a mountain jam-packed with precious minerals. The kings of the Lonely Mountain would unquestionably stand as part of the Fiction 500 as well.

Put it this way: Elros and Elrond split up his money. Elros used his half to build a fleet and then a ginormous palace. Elrond used his half to build Rivendell. And that was after the dwarves had raided Thingol's treasury because he refused to pay them for their work making the Nauglamir. Which was also gone by the time Elrond and Elros got there. Basically, the guy was loaded. But, as per usual in Tolkien's stories: this ended up badly for him. In the same book: apparently the Noldor took quite a bit of cash with them when they went to Middle Earth (presumably in the form of jewelry and weaponry). Gondolin, the city founded by King Turgon, was said to be the largest and most beautiful city in Middle Earth, although "a pale reflection of Elven Tirion in the Undying Lands"(where, of course, you don't need money to have cool stuff). Given the size of Minas Tirith, Gondolin must have been eye-poppingly huge. Ost-in-Edhil, aka Moria, was apparently also a very wealthy city and some of it's wealth can be seen in Lothlorien.

Both Lestat and Armand started poor (even though Lestat was a nobleman). Lestat gained a small fortune from his maker, who committed suicide shortly after turning Lestat. By modern days, Lestat has no idea how much money he has. He has accountants for that. All he does is tell them when he needs money, and they wire it. It's implied they invest the rest. Given that he's a vampire, he doesn't actually need that much, especially after gaining the ability to fly. In <em>Tale of the Body Thief</em>, a man asks for $20 million for one day of swapping bodies with him. While for Lestat this is pocket change, he's still reluctant to just give the money to a potential charlatan. Armand owns an island. And not a small one.
<ul><li> Lestat's latest protege, Quinn Blackwood, comes from an insanely wealthy Louisiana patrician family. His great-great-grandfather Manfred owned a large plantation and won the services of an exclusive law/investment firm in a poker game, letting him invest the family wealth for the kind of returns Wall Street executives have wet dreams over. Most of the Blackwood family is fairly low-key; for instance, Quinn's grandfather "Pops" attends cock fights and enjoys doing landscaping, while the plantation house itself serves as a bed-and-breakfast. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldLady">Aunt Queen</a>, on the other hand, has spent most of her life jet-setting across the globe, visiting wondrous sites and staying in five-star hotels. When Quinn comes into his inheritance, his first thoughts are of Pops and how money doesn't necessarily buy happiness, but then he concludes that money can <em>lease</em> happiness for as long as he'd like. He indulges in gifts for his family and friends and other extravagant purchases, but even so, these are done <em>with the accrued interest</em>. Despite everything he buys, he literally cannot spend his money faster than he makes it back.

This in an economy where ten dollars a week would be a higher than average wage — most Ankh-Morporkians would be happy to receive a dollar a day. It has been calculated that if seven million a year has been piling up ever since Sybil's grandfather stopped paying for regiments, the Ramkin wealth would be around three hundred million dollars. Sam has so far endowed a hospital, and heavily subsidises relief for Watch widows and orphans. And unlike other city nobles, he makes a point of paying his taxes.

He's stated that he doesn't <em>want</em> to rule the world, and actually would like to break up his company once the war ends, but if he wanted to, he could do it in a heartbeat, especially because he owns a solar-powered superlaser that can either melt asteroids or cut alien battleships in two.

However, it is not till much later that we find out just how extremely rich he is. Sherlock and Mycroft need to find data that has been stolen from a bank's computer system so they make an appointment to visit the bank. The bankers think that they are there on behalf of their father and on very short notice organize a banquet for them that would easily feed a dozen people. When the bankers discover the real reason for the visit, they are disappointed since they were hoping that they might be able to get a small percentage of Holmes Sr.'s banking business. To put things in perspective, the data theft will cost the bank millions and ruin their reputation but having the Holmes family as clients is seen as more profitable than recovering the data.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Lannisters are by far the richest family in the Seven Kingdoms, and Tywin Lannister is often called the richest man in the Seven Kingdoms — it's mentioned in one episode that King Robert owes them 3 million in gold, and they <em>still</em> have enough left to fork over 80,000 for a tournament with no problem. "As rich as a Lannister" seems to be a well-known phrase, enough so that Tyrion Lannister is able to use it to bribe his way out of a dungeon. Another common saying is that Tywin Lannister is so rich that he "shits gold." According to <em>Forbes</em> magazine, he is worth 2.1 billion American dollars in the books. That makes him exceedingly wealthy even by the standards of a modern economy, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/03/richest-characters-on-tv-ranked-empire">Vanity Fair<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> even estimates him to be worth <em>2.4 trillion American dollars</em>. The second season briefly mentions that House Lannister trades with the Free Cities and as far as Qarth. However, we discover in Season 4 <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that the Lannisters' wealth may not be as secure as thought. In one episode Tywin reveals that they have not mined any gold in three years, and they are also heavily indebted due to the war as most of the Lannisters' wealth was spent financing Joffrey's time on the throne during the War of the Five Kings; it's the reason why Tywin ends up allying with House Tyrell. Even worse in season 7, when the Iron Bank confronts Cersei for not paying the debts, as her family's vault is <em>empty</em> and not to mention, losing alliance with the Tyrells, because she orchestrated the bomb that killed Lord Mace, Margaery and Loras Tyrell.</span>

Xaro <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches">started with nothing</a>, but is now wealthy enough that he could personally fund a successful invasion of the Seven Kingdoms and it wouldn't even be a huge investment, or so it appeared, anyway. A later episode reveals that Daxos' vault is actually <em>empty</em>. He's still wealthy, of course ... his house, furnishings, and jewelry are worth quite a bit, and he presumably has investments elsewhere in the city as well ... but he doesn't have the liquid reserves that he claims.

Showing how powerful TV was at the time, viewers wrote into CBS (the network of the show) asking for a handout.
</li><li> An evil example appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em>: Dale "The Whale" Biederbeck, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard">Fat Bastard</a> extraordinaire. He's so enormously obese that he's trapped in his bed, but he doesn't need to move — the world moves <em>for</em> him. In Dale's debut episode, Captain Stottlemeyer mentions that he avoids publicity by buying up entire newspapers (not runs of newspapers, the <em>companies themselves</em>). Dale himself is shown casually calling a congressman (while Congress is in session, no less) and deciding his votes, and later telling a professional baseball coach to change the current pitcher; everyone immediately bows to his whims. Even when he's sent to prison, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuxuryPrisonSuite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuxuryPrisonSuite">cell is outfitted as a hotel room</a>, and he has a network of informants and electronics that let him know everything that happens in the complex.

</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest">Person of Interest</a></em>, Harold Finch is rich enough to be able to buy up 51% of a major corporation on demand at one point. On another occasion he buys a luxury hotel and makes the person they helped that episode the general manager. In yet another case, he gave a dry cleaning clerk a full-ride scholarship to Harvard Law so he could bug a businessman's clothes. He also casually purchases a security company to set up a cover story for Reese. When the background check is too thorough for that he simply buys a credit bureau as well. It's strongly indicated he <em>stole</em> most of his money in a prior career as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCracker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCracker">The Cracker</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Averted in season 4 after the Machine has to create new identities for the cast to protect them from its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> Samaritan, cutting off Finch's access to his money.

It's pretty crazy.
<ul><li> There's also the Shiba family, who must have some pretty solid investments. Antonio seemed to work to pay his way, but in the two years they were active, Shiba family money was supporting five Rangers and their mentor at home <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and Lauren and her mentor in hiding</span> and we know at least the previous generation did the same thing, plus the house was rebuilt in between.

Aside from owning at least a few apartment buildings in New York (under the name Walker Property Management, implying Walker Inc. was an umbrella company,) we don't really know what it does or how much it's worth except for the fact that it has made Stan and Karen <strong>obscenely</strong> wealthy. Just a few examples:
<ul><li> In one episode, Karen is upset that Stanley put her on a budget. When Grace asks how much, Karen writes the number down, and Grace responds that she should be able to live on this since <em>Spain</em> does.
</li><li> When Stan's possessions are divvied up in his will in season five, Karen is left $978 million.
</li><li> In another episode, Karen's personal wardrobe is shown to take up several rooms—at one point, she remarks that she "heard an echo in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyInMink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyInMink">Fur Vault</a>."
</li><li> It's revealed in one Christmas episode that <em>Karen</em>, whose official job title is assistant in Grace's interior design studio, provides Grace with an annual holiday bonus.
</li><li> When Karen divorces Stanley, she stays in the penthouse suite of New York's Plaza Hotel, which is consistently ranked as one of the fanciest (and most expensive) hotels in the entire world.

The investments and personal treasury of a Guild hierarch are equivalent to the wealth of one of Creation's mightiest trade-nations and the operating budget of the most powerful army in the world. The personal wealth of the Scarlet Empress is able to back the currency used by the vast majority of people in the Realm (which, note, is Creation's single largest economy), as well as being the credit for its most powerful bank. Even those are minimal compared to the finances of some of the wealthiest Exalted of the First Age. Further, the nature of reality in creation (a consensual one supported by the Order-Conferring Trade Pattern that exists as a bulwark against primordial chaos) means that large transactions by fiction 500 characters can damage the trade pattern, and therefore, REALITY ITSELF. Stock market crashes are deadly in Exalted.

The US government is willing to sacrifice the greatest soldier the world has ever known to get their hands on his money.

This is easiest with the Spaceship victory, since in most iterations the forms of government that allow you to hurry production of the starship (and everything else) with cash are also the forms of government that allow you to get incredible amounts of cash in the first place.
<ul><li> The Venetian civ from Civilization V takes the cake, as they are specifically designed this way. Playing as them, you cannot found new cities and are stuck with one.

</li><li> In Civilization VI, Mali gets ridiculously large bonuses towards gold generation from trade routes that start in deserts, as well as a unique district with extra gold adjacency bonuses <em>and</em> discounts on gold and faith purchases. This lets them outright buy most of the things they need, such as units, buildings, Great People and (with the right Governor upgrades) entire districts. A Mali player will generally be the richest player in the game by far.

It's possible to end up owning the majority of homes, businesses and street vendor stations in the entire nation.

A single ISK (The ingame currency among players) is stated as equivalent of years' worth of an ordinary salary. Meanwhile, most ships costs millions if not billions of ISK, meaning that even starting characters have a wealth comparable to the GDP of entire planets. Player controlled corporations and alliances are empires in their own right, with some alliances control numerous solar systems, moons and entire fleets of capital ships as reserves, making them literal in-universe examples. Furthermore, because of the ability to calculate a dollar-to-ISK value, battles and scams in EVE can be measured in the dollars destroyed or stolen, sometimes hitting the million dollar range.

At least that is what the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> sees.

Akiyama's so rich that he now does not see any value in money at all since he almost nightly spends it on a bunch of drinks with some of his old homeless buddies, and even losing his entire fortune throughout the series barely bothers him. This all came from a bunch of scattered banknotes he managed to scoop up during the explosive conclusion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza1">the first game.</a>

He has so much stuff that even he doesn't know what most of it is. His primary weapon, the Noble Phantasm called the Gate of Babylon, is a doorway to a pocket dimension that contains thousands upon thousands of priceless and powerful weapons, all of which belong to him. Consider this in comparison to other servants who might have two or three Noble Phantasms at most. At the same time, he has a particular character attribute called The Golden Rule, which measures a character's ability to attract wealth to himself. His is Rank A, which means that no matter what the situation and no matter when or where he might be, he is always guaranteed to have enough money to buy whatever he needs or wants and that more will simply fall into his lap.

<ul><li> The only reference to exactly how wealthy either of them actually could be comes from when Station transfers 0.76% of his shares in EC-Tec to Lt. Potter worth 4.6 million dollars.

While other former sports stars may still rake in the millions with endorsement deals, Herman receives a literal boatload of money in the form of a yacht filled with gold coins in exchange for starting a podcast.

</li><li> Though per <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> none of them is quite as rich as Xanatos, fellow <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> cast members <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Renard</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Demona</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Macbeth</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Thailog</a> are definitely up there too. According to Thailog, his wealth combined with Demona's and Macbeth's would put him on equal footing with Xanatos. He comes up with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plan">plan</a> to make this happen in one episode.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoldieGoldAndActionJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoldieGoldAndActionJack">Goldie Gold and Action Jack</a></em>, Goldie Gold has a flying car, has loads of tech on her person and in her mansion, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyInMink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyInMink">thinks a fur coat</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyCoolClothes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyCoolClothes">is proper adventuring wear</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em>:
<ul><li> Señor Senior Senior's private island first had such a power load it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBlackout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBlackout">blacking out Europe</a>. The bulk of it was going to a sun lamp bulb the size of a hot air balloon. He's one of the five richest people on Earth in the Kim Possible universe. The other four are his card club: one is the 'queen of daytime television' (alluding to Oprah perhaps), one appears to be a possible Russian expy of Bill Gates (the Software Czar), one is Poppop Porter (the snack food king) and the last is the Smarty Mart founder and CEO.
</li><li> Ron Stoppable (briefly). He invented the Naco, the top-selling menu item at Bueno Nacho, and in one episode received a check for 99 million dollars in royalties for his invention. Kim described him as "just south of billionaire." He blew a great deal of the money on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuousConsumption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuousConsumption">Conspicuous Consumption</a>, clothes, bling, and a private jet for himself and Kim, before Drakken and Shego stole the balance, ending his brief tenure on the Fiction 500 list. A number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFic">fan fics</a> suggest that he's still getting Naco royalties, which his parents had enough foresight to invest in a trust fund for him, so he may still belong on this list.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em>, this trope is greatly exaggerated to levels that would make the pun in Princess Morbucks name proud. Seriously, the Morbucks-family either has more money than most well-developed countries or their wallet is literally bottomless. When Princess' father gets her anything that she wants, he means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">EVERYTHING</a>. Their mansion is <em>huger</em> than huge and they even own enough land for there to be a theme park and race car track on the premises. Princess' father was even able to buy <em>the city of Townsville</em> in one episode (although, since it was bought from the Mayor, it only cost a room of Turkish Delight). It still counts because Mr. Morbucks had previously offered five trillion dollars.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies">Totally Spies!</a></em> takes place in the Beverly Hills, California, one of the most expensive cities in America — all three of the main characters presumably come from rich families, and their rival, Mandy, is proven to come from an even richer family, such as when her mother <em>bought an entire high-end shoe company chain simply to get one pair</em>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse">Metalocalypse</a></em> band Dethklok as a whole is considered the seventh largest economy on Earth. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">They've just passed Belgium!</a>)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, Charles Montgomery Burns, especially with his device to blot out the sun over Springfield and his (albeit limited) ownership of the world's only trillion dollar bill.
</li><li> Lucius Heinous VII on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes">Jimmy Two-Shoes</a></em>. One episode shows he spends more on trival things for him than it costs to run his whole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega-Corp</a>. And his son Beezy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">spends even more</a>.
</li><li> Eustace Strytch from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfJimmyNeutronBoyGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfJimmyNeutronBoyGenius">The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius</a></em> often rivals Jimmy's brain with his wad of cash. He easily manipulates people with his money, is able to buy space ships and fly to Mars and gets anything he points at, constantly dragging along his butler.
</li><li> Eddie, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClassOf3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClassOf3000">Class of 3000</a></em>, is the richest kid not just in school, but likely the world. His father is the CEO of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct">Cola-Cola</a>'s "Earth Division," which makes him so ludicrously wealthy that he can afford to buy air time on every single television channel in existence, fund massive displays of love for his crush Tomika on a daily basis, and, in a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">fourth-wall breaking humor</a>, have <em>five</em> fingers on his hands as opposed to the usual cartoon four. Unlike most examples on this list, though, Eddie is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledSweet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledSweet">a genuinely kind, generous kid</a>—he never lords his money over his friends, instead happily funding their exploits and participating in all manner of activities with them.
<ul><li> Sonny seems to be like this as well—his sprawling mansion in the woods contains entire separate ecosystems contained in individual rooms, and he once casually mentioned that he owned over a million designer outfits.
</li></ul></li><li> An Al Brodax <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popeye">Popeye</a></em> cartoon does a spoof of the 1950s TV show <em>The Millionaire</em> with Popeye the philanthropist doling out $1 million personal checks to Olive, Swee' Pea, Wimpy and—yes—Brutus. He then goes out in his sailor outfit to see how his friends spent the money. After seeing what they all did with the money (none too wisely), Popeye gives the rest of his money to the sailors' retirement fund.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em> episode "Megatron's Master Plan", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Shawn Berger</a> has his own private army and builds a fake solar power plant for the specific purpose of luring the Decepticons to it so he could show everybody that he could stop them.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PBAndJOtter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PBAndJOtter">PB&amp;J Otter</a></em>, the Snootie Poodles have enough money to buy so many toys that their children become bored with the toys bought for them in the morning by the afternoon and they get new ones. In the song "That's the Way to See the Great Outdoors," they sing "We're climbing up Mount Hoohaw, though we coulda had shipped" and are apparently quite serious about it. In another episode, they're actually shown having their likenesses carved into mountains like Mt. Rushmore.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YogiBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YogiBear">Yogi Bear</a></em> short "The Runaway Bear" features a multimillionaire who has, among other things, double-decker tennis courts, a pool for each foot, and dozens of big, shiny cars (with a little car inside each big car).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em>: Squilliam Fancyson, Squidward's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">rival</a>.
