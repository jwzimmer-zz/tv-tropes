This often occurs at the climax of the movie, and is frequently (though not always) treated as being a heartwarming and positive affirmation of the power of True Love/Independent Women for the would-be bride. The fact that it's also a humiliating, heartbreaking, psychologically-scarring betrayal for the would-be groom tends to be glossed over. Often occurs after the priest has said, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakNowOrForeverHoldYourPeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakNowOrForeverHoldYourPeace">Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Peace</a>."
</p><p>Alternately, we get stories focusing on the heartbroken bride who is left at the altar, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">absolute cad</a> who ran away and left her there.
</p><p>This trope could be the result of societal expectations. Men are stereotypically expected to have a dose of dread before a wedding. It's supposed to be more shocking when it's the woman who backs out to be free and single, or run away with another man. Since this offers zero comfort to the poor schlub who just got dumped in front of his family and friends on <em>his</em> big day, writers are careful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableFiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableFiance">not to develop the would-be groom too much</a>  or they flat-out make him the villain  to keep audiences from sympathizing with him and calling her out on her recklessness. This trope is particularly common if the character (or her social/cultural background) cares more about getting married than whether or not the relationship is marriage material in the first place. She runs away when she realizes this is absolutely not what she wants.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>While it is <em>more common</em> in modern works for it to be the woman who is viewed sympathetically, whether she is the runaway partner or the jilted-at-the-altar partner, there are plenty of cases of it being played the other way. Generally, it depends on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticPOV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticPOV">gender of the protagonist.</a>
</p><p>If these characters think a bit more and made their escape before the ceremony, they become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunawayFiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunawayFiance">Runaway Fiancé(e)s</a> instead.

In her wedding dress. For added fun it's mentioned that the guys at the recruiting station were a little leery of inducting a girl in a wedding dress, until she mentioned that her father (who'd arranged the marriage) was a colonel in the Air Force. After they heard that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry">they signed her right up just to spite him</a>.

The bride is moved by his words to abandon her fiance, a man she doesn't love.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> Lola ran away from her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> with Loki the giant (who genuinely loved her) as Lola wanted to be free to choose whom she married.

Its also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">beautifully ironic</a> as when were first introduced to Lola, shes considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbhorrentAdmirer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbhorrentAdmirer">Abhorrent Admirer</a> who's utterly desperate for men to marry her though shes always rejected.

In Episode 22, she adds that the woman was running away from her own wedding. To Maki, the point of the story is that wanting something isn't enough; you have to have a plan to get it.

After spending a weekend with the groom's family, the bride confessed at the altar to the whole family that she had blackmailed the man (her subordinate at the New York publishing firm where they both worked) into marrying her to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CitizenshipMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CitizenshipMarriage">avoid being deported</a>.

Valium doesn't really seem to mind, though. Partially because he's a narcoleptic that has no dialog anyway, and partly because the only reason the two of them were getting married at all was because Valium and Vespa were the only Princess and Prince in the galaxy, respectively. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlySuitableSuitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlySuitableSuitor">Until Lone Starr finds out he's a prince too, thus fixing the problem</a>.

She tells her would-be groom that she's unsure about the wedding and the two agree to call it off. Once outside the church, though, she happens to see her original love interest Harvey... and it turns out <em>their</em> soulstones fit. Not <em>quite</em> an altar abandonment in that both the guy and the girl mutually agree to end the ceremony, but they still gloss it over for the guy. Uniquely enough the initial wedding was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthDateMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthDateMarriage">Fourth Date Marriage</a>, and Sabrina didn't think the proposal was serious at first.

She loves Juan, Juan loves her, but Juan has a large family, and so she refuses him. She continued her relation with Félix, who constantly lied to her and manipulated her, but at least he's single and has no sons. But, as the car was going to the chapel, she could not go on with it anymore, and run away. When the car arrived, the ceremony started. One of the front doors was opened, revealing Aurora's father... and then the other door, showing that Aurora is not there.

Much like the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace">Will &amp; Grace</a></em> example above, it's revealed the guy was a jerk who would no doubt have eventually made her miserable, but she's still blasted by pretty much everyone (who all quite reasonably ask why she waited until literally the last minute to dump him) except for his brother, who hates him and relishes the humiliation he'll suffer.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWanderer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWanderer">The Wanderer</a></em>, the reincarnated Lady Claire literally leaves her present day fiancé at the altar for her similarly reincarnated Knight.
</li><li> The very first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace">Will &amp; Grace</a></em> has Grace leave her groom because Will disapproved of him.

</li><li> Gilbert O'Sullivan's "Alone Again Naturally," the first three verses of which are an oddly-upbeat diddy about getting dumped at the altar.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em>: Angela and Hodgins run away from their own wedding — together — after they discover <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Angela's <em>still</em> married, as she'd mistakenly thought the wedding ceremony with her first husband (jumping through a fire) hadn't stuck.</span> They leave behind a horrified, confused group of people, with Brennan (the maid of honor) and Booth (the best man) standing at the altar with the priest. Brennan clears her throat awkwardly and asks what they're supposed to do.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>, Ted initially has some doubts about running away with his ex-girlfriend Victoria, but eventually agrees, on the condition that she leaves a note. During the ensuing hijinks, Ted discovers that Klaus, the groom, is <em>also</em> running away, and Ted uses this inside knowledge to clear Victoria of any blame. Awkwardly, the three of them somehow end up rooming together.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LifeGoesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LifeGoesOn">Life Goes On</a></em>, eldest daughter Paige, who has been having panic attacks in the days leading up to her wedding, waits until she's at the altar before asking her fiance if he really loves her. He admits that he does but that they're not right for each other and nowhere near ready. Sure enough, she goes dashing down the aisle to reunite with her true love, with her now ex-fiance's blessing.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityShow">Reality Show</a>, <em>Married by America,</em> two couples who met over the course of the show were to be married, and both ended like this. In one couple, it was the bride who backed out; in the other, the groom. It was pretty much the death-knell for wedding-themed reality shows (as opposed to just dating), since they've never ended well. Who would have thought marrying someone you've only known for three months was actually a bad idea?
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Martin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Martin">Martin</a></em>, Martin and Gina get fed up with their overbearing relatives and take off to the Bahamas with just a few of their friends. Give how well it went off, one suspects this was the plan all along.
</li><li> Subverted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">The Office</a></em>. While Jim and Pam do get married in front of all of their friends, it turns out they sneaked off and eloped before, anticipating that the gang might do something stupid.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PartyOfFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PartyOfFive">Party of Five</a></em>:
<ul><li> In season 2, Charlie gets cold feet and freaks out about his wedding to Kirsten. After some convincing from everyone he opts to go through with it. Then comes the reveal that Kirsten is calling the wedding off. She says if Charlie got cold feet then she couldn't marry him because he wasn't sure about the relationship. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> They eventually get married four years later with no cold feet</span>.
</li><li> A few episodes earlier, Kirsten and Charlie get fed up with the pressure of trying to plan their wedding and leave a note saying they've run off to Reno to get married right away. At the end of the episode they show up at the house saying they couldn't go through with it.
</li><li> These two really seem to love this trope. The season 2 finale has Charlie convincing Kirsten to leave her fiancée at the altar and get back together with him. Considering she was marrying the man only a couple of months after leaving Charlie, this was probably for the best.
</li></ul></li><li> One year before doing the first example herself, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SabrinaTheTeenageWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SabrinaTheTeenageWitch">Sabrina the Teenage Witch</a></em> had an example in the sixth season. Roxie decides to marry a witch boy, though she doesn't know he's a witch. To prevent the wrath of her tyrannical Aunt Irma, Sabrina pretends to be the bride and even tries to marry Peter in Roxie's place. Once the ruse is revealed, the wedding is called off. Roxie and Peter later postpone the engagement until they get to know each other better.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShakeItUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShakeItUp">Shake it Up</a></em>, Georgia and Jeremy realize they aren't ready to get married and break off their engagement at the altar.
</li><li> Engineered by Tom in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WaitingForGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WaitingForGod">Waiting for God</a></em> - Diana has been single for over 60 years and wants to remain that way, but her latter-years lover Tom is unsatisfied with his role as the last of a long line of equally significant lovers. After many hijinks as Diana tries to avoid having to marry Tom, Tom ultimately refuses to marry her instead. They then carry on their affair as normal, Tom accepting that Diana having been willing to marry him at all is good enough and he doesn't need to actually force the issue.
<div class="indent"><strong>Geoffrey:</strong> Dad! You're supposed to say "I do". <br/><strong>Tom:</strong> But I don't.
</div></li><li> An episode of the reality series <em>What Would You Do?</em> used this scenario for inspiration in which they staged both a runaway bride and later a runaway groom getting cold feet and escaping to a bar. The scenario was intended to see how bystanders would react to the situation. In all scenarios, be it bride or groom, the bystanders all convinced the cold-footed spouse-to-be to get to their wedding and supported them.
