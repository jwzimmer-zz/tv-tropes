</p><p>Alternatively, you might be one of those humans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalitySeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalitySeeker">looking for</a> easy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality">immortality</a>. Either way, once you finish scanning the brain, you end up with a file that you run in a physics simulator, and presto, you have a computer that remembers being a human. If you do it carefully enough, the original brain won't even notice it happening.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>This computer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transhuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transhuman">has a number of advantages</a> over a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallAHumanAMeatBag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallAHumanAMeatBag">meat human</a>. The simulation can be run many thousands of times faster than objective speed, if you've got enough computing power. It can be backed up with trivial ease. You can run multiple copies at the same time, and have them do different things, make exotic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindHive">personality composites</a>, and tinker around with the inner workings of the brain in ways that are either difficult or impossible to do with a meat brain. Additionally, there's the fact that it's impossible to kill as long as its data is backed up somewhere and there exists a computer on which to run it  you can just restart the simulation wherever you left off and the mind won't even recognize it.
</p><p>Critics of the concept are quick to point out that it presupposes an understanding of neurology (not just human neurology, but even the neurology of a common insect) far, <em>far</em> beyond what currently exists; and that without that knowledge, even the most powerful computer cannot do this. Proponents of the idea assure us that this knowledge is coming. Proponents who hope to live to see and actually benefit from it assure us that it's coming really really soon.

</p><p>The advantages bestowed by brain uploading are a bit overwhelming if you're trying to incorporate them into a story. It kind of kills the tension when the protagonist can restore from backup whenever the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> kills them. Authors have devised a number of cop-outs, which you can recognize by asking these questions:
</p><p></p><ul><li> What is the underlying mechanism of the upload? Is the computer simulating every atom in every neuron, or is the upload applying memories and personality characteristics to a default template?
</li><li> Is uploading destructive? Depending on which process you use, it may be possible to do it nondestructively, but many authors deem it convenient to have it destroy the original, to avoid the confusion of having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues">two copies of the same character</a> running around.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note07nh8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note07nh8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note07nh8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The easiest, and currently the only vaguely practical process would be to take the brain down to liquid nitrogen temps, then image it with a scanning probe microscope. Except that a SPM has to get the probe within nanometers of the surface it's scanning, so after you scan a layer of brain, you scrape it off with a diamond microtome and scan the next layer down. You end up with a map of the locations of each atom in the brain, and a pile of rapidly defrosting brain slices on the operating room floor. This is also the most destructive brain uploading process imaginable that doesn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">involve TNT</a>.</span>

Or does the brain's pattern need to be copied <em>exactly</em> to still function like a mind, leaving no room for radical enhancements?
</li><li> Can the upload be copied? If the answer is "no", the work might be on the soft end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfSciFiHardness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfSciFiHardness">Mohs Scale of Sci-Fi Hardness</a>, although it's also possible to make it a little harder by running the AIs on a quantum computer and saying something about the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">No-Cloning Theorem</a>". Or simply declare the recording to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloneDegeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloneDegeneration">analog.</a>
</li></ul><p>Widespread Brain Uploading tends to lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSingularity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSingularity">The Singularity</a> or something very much like it. Or it may be a <em>result</em> of said Singularity.
</p><p>There's also a pile of legal, moral, and theological questions and concerns that might be addressed in the story, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/BrainUploading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/BrainUploading">discussed at length on the Analysis page.</a>
</p><p>Compare with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualGhost">Virtual Ghost</a>, where the uploaded brain can control a projection of themselves to interact with the real world. Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeuralImplanting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeuralImplanting">Neural Implanting</a>, where computer files are uploaded to the brain instead of the other way around, though both tropes are occasionally used together.

He can't upload her mind directly, so he just programs as much information about his sister as he can, and for much of the series she attempts to emulate her. Then, after an accident wipes out all that data, Kokobunji declines to replace it, saying she should just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself">be herself</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitCrossboneGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitCrossboneGundam">Mobile Suit Crossbone Gundam</a></em> and its sequels like this one.
<ul><li> <em>Skull Heart</em> has an interesting example: the Jupiter Empire somehow got ahold of the original Gundam's battle computer, which had stored in it Amuro Ray's complete battle data from the One Year War. They used this to create a partial AI and uploaded it into a new Gundam... which went berserk and attacked everything in sight because someone didn't set the targeting parameters correctly. Although it's destroyed, it's briefly hinted, right as the machine "dies", that a true piece of Amuro's mind might have been present in the data.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Crux Dogatie</a> does something similar in the original <em>Crossbone Gundam</em> story: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As a very old, very decrepit man, he makes extensive use of robot stand-ins and ends up developing the original bio-brain system.

</li><li> <em>Steel Seven</em> has Callisto's Shadow transferring his consciousness into a bio-brain after his death on Earth, using his telepathic brother's mind as a go-between. This bio-brain is then loaded into the Digitus so that he can fight alongside his still-living twin in the final battle.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GalaxyExpress999" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GalaxyExpress999">Galaxy Express 999</a></em> has a couple of instances of a gigantic supercomputer being used to simulate the brain of a deceased human. Whether the series' main antagonists, the "Machine-Humans", also qualify or are simply disembodied human brains inhabiting robotic shells is not made clear.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar">GaoGaiGar</a></em> resorts to this when they need to build new robots but don't have the time to build the AI from scratch.
<ul><li> It's mentioned that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a> for KyoRyu and EnRyu took six months to develop. This results in the ridiculously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> Goldymarg and the child-like Mic Sounders.
</li><li> Mic Sounders Boom Robo was uploaded from Stallion White; this is why Mic was able to System Change to protect Stallion's sister Swan before his limiters were removed. No one's sure where the Cosmo Robo personality actually came from; maybe that's that that's what a young Super-AI actually acts like.
</li><li> Pei La Cain and Palus Abel, two of the villains from <em>FINAL</em>, are supposedly based on the actual masters of the Green and Red Planets. Given that three of GGG's units are children, biologically or metaphorically, of Cain or Abel, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Guy himself</a>, this results in brief angst. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Very brief</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em>:
<ul><li> When not focusing on sociology, the series likes to take a trip down this lane. Memories can be copied easily and reliably, but an individual's 'ghost', the verse's term for consciousness, can not be safely or easily altered or copied. Expensive and rare techniques called 'ghost-dubbing' actually upload this consciousness into an electronic format, but the result is always more limited or more insane than the biological version, and the biological suffers heavy brain damage and eventually death as a result, which is why ghost dubbing is <em>highly</em> illegal in the GITS universe, punishable by life in prison or brain-wipe. It's not really clear that the resulting electronic copies are the same mind, or just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">AI capable of pretending</a>. The resulting copy <em>can</em> be copied many times, but will degenerate each time it is copied. It also asks the question of what makes up a mind, the soul or the memories, when a boy receives all of his father's memories with interesting effects. Whether true mind-uploading is possible within the universe is still up at arms, as most of the attempts either don't try hard enough or don't involve humans in the first place.
</li><li> The second feature film, <em>Innocence</em>, features a multitude of ghost-dubbed dolls manipulated for the purpose of freeing the enslaved children used to dub them. It raises the question of whether, being imparted with some aspect of human consciousness, the dubbed dolls cannot be considered alive, and thus victims themselves in the film's violent plot.

Just how this could be possible when a brain should only be able to host one Ghost, and it's impossible for a Ghost to leave its original "data-storage" without highly specialized equipment as described above, is never explained. It's more likely that they're not entering that brain, rather just viewing particular data and encountering something not unlike the Individual Eleven meme.

<ul><li> Alpha-level uploads are considered sentient in their own right, and when they're first developed constructing them kills the human in question.

Most people prefer nondestructive uploads with periodic updates, for obvious reasons. It's also implied that it takes a certain strength of will and personality to become an upload... many of the first group of uploadees who undergo destructive scanning do not thrive in their new virtualities and many crash or became corrupted. Later systems presumably had this bug ironed out, though it is never explicitly mentioned.
</li><li> Beta-level simulations are generally not considered sentient, although a <em>particularly good</em> beta-level simulation that was trained over a very long period of time may well appear sentient if you don't know any better, to the point where it may as well be considered an AI.

Bodies are referred to as "sleeves" and society as a whole doesn't value life as much since you only suffer 'Real Death' if your cortical stack is destroyed — and cortical stacks are heavily armored. They can be destroyed, but it takes a good deal of effort to do so.

They then get downloaded into physical bodies again the first seven deaths, then spend their next eight rebirths solely in a virtual reality. Then they die for good. Nondestructive uploads can also be made, and their experiences reintegrated at a later date. This allows for the possibility of people uploading copies of themselves to have a passionate affair in a suitably private virtuality, and then redownload the experiences into their minds and fully appreciate them later without interfering with work or family life.

This is done by first building a physical analog of a human brain, but with several times the complexity, then once it has displayed the necessary capabilities, uploading the mind of one of the creators into it, and parts of the personalities of the others. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This results in the creation of a god, like in all Frank Herbert books.</span>

The result was basically a human-looking droid who answered to the same name and had the right memories and personality, but couldn't touch the Force and didn't feel any angst when captured and given a restraining bolt. General consensus was that doing this had been a mistake. There was also a Jedi character who'd uploaded herself into a spaceship somehow; the end of the book had droidboy getting destroyed and his girlfriend committing suicide while leaving her body intact so that spaceship girl could inhabit it.

It set out on its own and took over an (uninhabited) planet, but still maintains cordial, if slightly inscrutable, relations with humanity in the 2380s, when the story takes place.

ANA is the official government of Earth, definitely the most powerful faction in the human Greater Commonwealth, and possibly one of the most powerful physical or semi-physical factions in the galaxy. Important uploaded folks maintain organic bodies in storage for when they need to interact with physical humans or aliens. Less important people can have a body cloned for them upon request if they want to stretch their legs. Few do.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregEgan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregEgan">Greg Egan</a> loves this trope and the philosophical questions it poses:
<ul><li> In "Learning to Be Me", children are fitted with a "jewel" — a small solid-state computer that monitors all brain activity and emulates it, guiding (or forcing) a slaved AI to be a mental clone of the growing child. As middle age approaches, it is traditional to have the failing grey goo scooped out of your skull and let the jewel take over. If you <em>are</em> the failing grey goo, you have a horrible dilemma to face — but are you <em>absolutely sure</em> you aren't the jewel?
</li><li> <em>Permutation City</em> centers around the topic of brain uploading. In it simulations, including environments such as cities, are created for people who create virtual clones of themselves. For research purposes the protagonist himself uploads his brain multiple times, yet the virtual clones kept killing themselves so he chooses to make an experiment.

This gives them great control over their own minds: xenobiologists can make alien copies of their consciousnesses to act as emissaries and translators, artists can loan out their sense of aesthetics, space travelers can slow their perceptions and suspend their capacity for boredom, and so on. By the second part of the book, most characters are the "descendants" of uploaded individuals and have never been organic.

This procedure involves shutting down an area for miles lest any EM emissions interfere with the process. For the same reason, perpetual rain clouds are induced in the area to block solar radiation. The containers for the mind are large buildings full of gel. This makes one character to wonder if everyone will take up as much space after an upload. The other character thinks that anyone else's mind will probably fit into a suitcase. Unfortunately, the subject dies with only 98% of the process complete, making this a partial success.

The patient is immersed in a tub of microscopic machines, which infiltrate the body and begin to scan and record everything while destroying the tissue to power themselves. The scanned brain is then downloaded into a robotic body designed to mimic human appearance. However, because the scan is only of a few seconds of brain activity and because of the non-rewritable nature of the robotic brain, emotions recorded when someone is "finished" remain lingering for the rest of the time they remain alive in their artificial body. So if someone is finished on a good day, they'll always be in a fairly good mood.

Later on, his android body is damaged, so his "crystal sphere" is plugged into that of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> instead (thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlugNPlayTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlugNPlayTechnology">Plug 'n' Play Technology</a>). By the end of the arc, he grows an appropriately-aged clone for himself and downloads his mind into it.

According to the official story, at the moment of death, the net beams the total sum of the person's knowledge (including the memory of dying) into the aTan Corporation's databanks. If the person's resurrection has been paid (always in advance), the nearest aTan facility replicates a new body based on the saved template and downloads the person's mind into it. The real truth is that it's impossible for a neural net to send out so much information in a single burst, especially since it's entirely possible for it to be damaged or destroyed during the person's death. Instead, the net is constantly transmitting new memories, and the end of the transmission is treated as death. Attempts to block the transmission trigger a resurrection, except the new body might have all the person's memories but none of the consciousness. Should the original find a way to kill himself, the new body suddenly becomes a full-fledged person.

<ul><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/The100" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/The100">The 100</a></em>, Becca invented a means of downloading a person's mind onto a computer chip inserted in the back of their head. The original version of this technology was just supposed to store a person's memories for examination by others; they didn't retain consciousness while stored in the chip. However, Sanctum's scientists figured out how to implant the chip into another person's head, erasing that person's mind and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyBackupDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyBackupDrive">allowing the memories and personality stored inside to take over</a>. Becca's later refinement of the concept was the Flame, which can hold the minds and memories of multiple people, and be passed on from one person to the next, but without actually overwriting the new host's personality, merely letting them commune with the stored consciousnesses.
</li><li> Discussed in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AdamRuinsEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AdamRuinsEverything">Adam Ruins Everything</a></em> episode "Adam Ruins Death". Adam points out that copying our memories onto a computer, even when that becomes a possibility, will just make an advanced version of Siri. A clip shows an old man hooked up to a computer. The computer shows a simulated face that appears to be the man's uploaded mind. Then the old man realizes that <em>he</em> is still dying, no matter what. The episode's point is that death is inevitable and that we should just accept that it's going to happen and not expect science to solve that eternal fact.

Zoe-A is an uploaded version of Zoe Graystone who died in a terrorist attack. Up to her point of death, she was streaming data to her virtual avatar, so Zoe-A is an almost duplicate of the original Zoe. Other people who were uploaded with less data tend to have holes in their memories and personalities. Once the technology went public, many factions found their own uses for brain uploading; Corporations sold brain uploading as an insurance against death and a way for grieving families to stay in touch with the deceased. At the same time, a terrorist organisation figured that uploading their martyrs into a virtual heaven they've built was a good loophole to resolve the whole question of what happens after death.

In <em>Reconstruction</em>, it's revealed that the Alpha AI that Project Freelancer tortured to create <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralSplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralSplitPersonality">Literal Split Personalities</a> to harvest was based on a brain scan of the project's director, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leonard Church</span>, specifically to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">get around laws forbidding the mistreatment of artificial intelligence</a>, since he argued that any tortures he inflicted on the Alpha were more or less done to himself. The Beta fragment, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">better known as Tex</span>, is an unusual variant in that it was created not through psychological torture but as a side effect of the Alpha's creation, born from the Director's strong memories of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostLenore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostLenore">Lost Lenore</a>.

It does have its drawbacks, however. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumHandlingRequirements" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumHandlingRequirements">Only one-in-a-million people can actually use gen:LOCK</a> (you <em>don't</em> wanna know <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">what happens</a> if you try without being compatible), and only for a very short period of time. Staying in gen:LOCK for too long runs the risk of not being able to return to their bodies <em>at all</em>.
<ul><li> It turns out that there are some serious side effects to staying uploaded for too long, however. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Union "Nemesis" mech is the original mind of Chase, captured by the Union, tortured and broken, and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues">copied hundreds of times over</a> before being locked within the distinctly inhuman Nemesis chassis for far longer than it should be</span>.

</li><li> There's also an age limit on gen:LOCK pilots. Even if a pilot is compatible, the technology's dependency on high neuroplasticity - which decreases as one ages - means that a pilot can age out of the program. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leon is compatible but considered too old. When he uploads into a Holon out of desperation at the end of the first season, his brain is severely damaged when he tries to return to his body, leaving him comatose</span>.
</li><li> Another example is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Caliban</span>, who contains an early prototype of the gen:LOCK technology and carries <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a small part of Doctor Weller's own personality and knowledge in his chassis.</span>

Unfortunately, the process drives Stalin insane, and he launches a nuke at the "traitors" in the Kremlin. Understandably, the Soviets pull the plug on him after this.
</li><li> Francisco Franco does something similar with a supercomputer recovered from an Atlantean outpost. Since unlike Stalin he's still alive when the transition happens, he maintains his sanity. Things still don't really work out for him, though — various factions not happy with the idea of him ruling Spain forever rebel, triggering a bloody <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">Civil War</a> that ultimately results in the supercomputer and Franco's remaining loyalists squirreled away in a fortified compound, leaving Franco alive but powerless.
