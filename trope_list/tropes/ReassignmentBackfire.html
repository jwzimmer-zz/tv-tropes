After all, a planet that barely even has space travel could hardly have any trouble for her to get into, and there'd be nothing to report so her superiors wouldn't have to deal with her anymore.

However, she knows more than they realize, and takes advantage of her reassignment to quietly learn even more, while also secretly setting into motion a plan to foil the government conspiracy she's uncovered.
</li><li> Roy Mustang has a similar thing happen: he is transferred to the east because it is so dull. It backfires on the higher ups because they end up having to flee there because Scar was killing them in Central.

Tylor's superiors get more and more frustrated as the series goes on. They start by using the <em>Soyokaze</em> (Tylor's ship) as bait in important operations, gradually move to pointless suicide missions and by the end they are outright hiring pirates to kill him.
</li><li> Pretty much Episode 19's plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico">Martian Successor Nadesico</a></em>. The higher ups got tired of Yurika and attempted to shunt her out by hijacking a contest originally made to raise morale (and was already hijacked by Yurika by changing the prize to be captain for a day). Their plan backfired when the winner forfeited out of embarrassment and Yurika got it back by virtue of being second place.

Originally transferred there to become the laughing stock of the school and set an example to the other students, their situation takes a turn for the better when they are assigned the task of killing an almighty alien who properly teaches them in all regular subjects (including assassination skills). Together, they eventually become far more skilled than their "elite" schoolmates and a 10 billion yen bonus shall be given to whoever manages to kill him. However, they must do it in one year, or Earth is doomed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em> inverts this slightly — when the <em>Archangel</em> arrives in JOSH-A, the Earth Alliance brass reassign three crew members — Mu La Flaga, Flay Allster, and Natarle Badgiruel — to other sections as they feel they have greater purposes for the war and leave the rest of the Archangel crew at JOSH-A. However, Mu has a suspicion that something's wrong and discovers that it's a trap - the brass know ZAFT is setting up to attack and have armed a Cyclops System to wipe them all out and the <em>Archangel</em> is the bait as they believe that, because of Kira Yamato's time on the ship, it's "tainted" by his Coordinator presence and thus the <em>Archangel</em> can die with the rest of them. Mu stays with the <em>Archangel</em>, Flay is kidnapped by Rau Le Creuset and Natarle is the only whose reassignment sticks. Oh, and those on the <em>Archangel</em> become a real pain in <em>everyone's</em> sides.

<ul><li> Traditionally, the origin of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">The Mighty Thor</a></em> involves Odin sending the character to Earth in order to teach him humility before he ascends the throne as his heir. It works, but Thor ends up liking Earth so much that he is often extremely reluctant to return to Asgard, and even more to becoming its ruler. This is partially due to Thor being the son of Mother Earth herself, Gaea.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987">Wonder Woman (1987)</a></em>, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a> died, the Amazons made her mother, Queen Hippolyta, take up the mantle in her stead, as a form of penance for indirectly causing Diana's death. Hippolyta enjoyed being a superhero so much that she kept at it even after Diana came back from the dead, and eventually abolished the monarchy entirely.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/KnightsOfTheDinnerTable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/KnightsOfTheDinnerTable">Knights of the Dinner Table</a></em>: When Hard 8 reinstates Nitro's GM credentials, it is with the provision that he is only allowed to GM the Pee Wee Hackleague. Nitro proceeds to take his Pee Wee team all the way to the Garycon finals.
</li><li> A variation occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a> Season Eight</em>. Rona thought that transferring Simone from Chicago to Rome would soften her up (though Buffy herself thought she did it simply because she didn't want to put up with Simone anymore). Instead, Andrew annoyed her so much that she ended up going rogue, becoming one of Buffy's greatest enemies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XWingRogueSquadron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XWingRogueSquadron">X-Wing Rogue Squadron</a></em>: Soontir Fel is banished to the 181st Fighter Group — bad enough to be nicknamed the One-Eighty-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">Worst</a></em> — and quickly transforms it into one of the Empire's most elite units.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AAPessimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AAPessimal">A.A. Pessimal</a>, the nineteen-year-old Johanna Smith-Rhodes is first encountered as a conscript Army soldier who led an unsanctioned raid into a hostile neighbouring country, with the stated intention of killing a warlord who raided into her country. Suceeding in this and becoimg something of a heroine, she is posted, effectively, as a Marine, part of an armed escort aboard a ship with a valuable cargo. What she doesn't realise until she gets there is that hers in a one-way ticket - she has effectively been exiled to faraway Ankh-Morpork. Where the Guild of Assassins has been persuaded to offer her a choice - join us as a mature entrant or die trying. She learns later that her country does not want people who very nearly start an all-out war with a powerful neighbour, and considered exile would resolve a problem. Johanna begins a career as an Assassin and gets to be rather good at it. She also grows up and likes it in Ankh-Morpork. Her home country uncomfortably realises they didn't solve a problem. They simply moved it several thousand miles away <em>and</em> gave it a lot of in-depth skills training. Which proves useful both to the Guild <em>and</em> to Lord Vetinari.
<ul><li> Elsewhere, Alison Grose is one of the first women to graduate from the Fools' Guild. Forced by the machinations of Lord Vetinari to take a complement of female students, the Guild is at a loss as to what to do with them after they graduate. It is at pains to point out that while they have been forced by circumstances to <em>liberalise</em>, they are not <em>that</em> liberal. Alison, aware she is not especially wanted in Ankh-Morpork, gladly accepts an offer from King Verence of Lancre to become his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJester" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJester">Court Jester</a>. Verence, a much-respected Guild graduate and a King, beleives a female jester can't be any worse and may indeed be refreshingly different. The Fools' Guild therefore has to accept that like it or not, there is now a fully accredited Lady Jester out there. Alison thus takes full advantage of exile to a remote backwater Kingdom, one where the Guild cannot easily track or monitor what she is doing, to begin to develop the skills of Clown, Jester and Troubador in excitingly new and novel ways.

In an attempt to discredit the new chef, Linguini (who, unknown to Skinner, is simply a front for Remy the rat, who is a brilliant cook), he orders him to prepare an off menu dish using an obscure recipe that even Auguste Gusteau wrote off as horrible. However, Remy is able to modify the recipe dramatically and make the dish a scrumptious success that runs the kitchen staff ragged supplying all the patrons who now want to try it. To Skinner's shock, this busy night removes all doubts in the kitchen staff that Linguini is a master chef.

</li></ul></li><li> Kind of played with, in that at least on the first occasion (Basilisk Station) her career would have gotten a significant boost even without the crisis.

But he ended up doing the right thing, but not being able to get glory or promotions from it for complex political reasons.
<ul><li> And then subverted again when he gets reassigned to ImpSec, as the only branch that will take him, where all of his following spectacular successes are so highly classified that he can't tell anyone about them, nor can his superiors justify giving him a promotion without the uninformed saying that he's only being advanced because of nepotism.

</li></ul></li><li> In the second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl">Artemis Fowl</a> novel <em>Artemis Fowl: The Arctic Incident</em> elf LEP recon captain Holly Short is assigned to guarding an abandoned shuttle port where nothing has happened in literally a hundred years. Naturally, she encounters a huge goblin smuggling program which involves the use of a human contact and illegal weapons.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flashman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flashman">Flashman</a> is a good example of this. Harry Flashman, freshly expelled from Rugby School, joins the prestigious 11th Hussars. Within a year, he gets into a duel over a woman, and is posted to Glasgow, assisting the local militia against agitating mill workers. He seduces the prettiest daughter of the mill owner he's billeted with, and is forced to marry her. This doesn't sit well with Lord Cardigan, the commander of the 11th Hussars, and he gets posted again, this time to India (a location hated and despised by Cardigan). Flashman's skill with a horse and lance impresses the Governor General, and he's sent as an ADC to Kabul, on General Elphinstone's staff. He gains (stolen) credit with the natives as "Bloody Lance", the lone killer of five would-be assassins, and gains credit with the military and public when he's one of the few survivors of the Kabul Retreat, and "defends" a small fort outside the besieged Jalalabad — he's found surrounded by dead, clutching the flag to his chest. As the only (white) survivor, he feels free to not contradict the CO's assumption that he wasn't cowering uselessly in bed, and was in fact about to throw the flag to the attackers. He gets a hero's send-off from India, a hero's welcome upon his return, and a medal from Queen Victoria herself.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern">Dragonriders of Pern</a></em> series, this appeared to be the case with Masterharper Petiron, the old harper of Menolly's repressed, backwater fishing hold. Subverted later in <em>Masterharper of Pern</em>, when we find out that Petiron asked to be sent there, to make a fresh start where no one knew he was other than "the harper". And he chose this over the protests of his superior, his son Robinton.
<ul><li> It could also be said that Petiron wanted Robinton to be his own man and not be perceived as his father's son. He deliberately stepped out of the way to allow Robinton to become a better leader.
</li><li> Eh, by this time in the book, Petiron is the only harper who <em>doesn't</em> know that Robinton is a much better harper than he is.
</li></ul></li><li> Sort of subverted in Yulia Latynina's <em>Wizards and Ministers</em> (also, a political version): <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">Mr. Nan's</a> "all-powerful secretary" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Mr. Shavash</a> is suddenly sent out of the capital to a distant province. Some people think that this is an exile and a sign of disfavour. Others think that Mr. Nan is <em>deliberately</em> arranging this very trope. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's probably the latter, but everything goes horribly wrong for everyone involved before this plan could bear fruit.</span>
</li><li> In the third book of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber">David Weber</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Safehold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Safehold">Safehold</a></em> series, it gets played somewhat unusually. The commander in question is in fact incompetent, but the general doesn't want to fire him for political reasons, so he puts him in command of the rear of their defense of a mountain pass. Unfortunately, the other side gets around behind them, so they have to move quickly to escape the pass and redeploy. Unfortunately, the incompetent commander has to get moving before the rest of the army can go anywhere.
</li><li> Another variant occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Antares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Antares">Antares Passage</a></em>. Captain Drake has nothing against his Sandarian exchange officer, Ensign Philip Walkirk.

So he assigns him to command the Marine detachment, figuring that there's little chance they'll see any action. Later, the Marines end up boarding a Ryall transport. Fortunately, Philip survives unscathed.

<ul><li> Position of Master of Coin is supposed to be the weakest position on King's council. Basically, the job involves collecting taxes and providing money whenever the king needs it, with no prospects for gaining personal glory or fame, committing valiant deeds, or being remembered at all. Then King Robert assigned the position to Littlefinger...
</li><li> From the backstory, there's the rivalry between Unwin Peake, the scheming regent and Hand of the boy-king Aegon III, and Alyn Velaryon, the Oakenfist, a legitimised bastard and popular hero. Eventually Peake ordered Oakenfist to put down the then-ongoing Iron Islands rebellion; this would involve sailing his fleet clear around the continent, through the middle of an ongoing naval war between the Free Cities and the pirates of the Stepstones, to engage a numerically superior foe on his home turf. Unfortunately for Peake, the leader of the Iron Men was murdered by one of his salt wives and his rebellion fell apart, and on the way home Oakenfist managed to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">find the king's long-lost brother, Viserys, and bring him home</span>, making him an even bigger hero than before.
</li></ul></li><li> A bit of a variation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em>: the disgraced Seerow is stationed on the Hork-Bajir homeworld, which the Andalite superiors believe to not be in any way significant. Then the Yeerks arrive. The variation? Seerow is killed almost immediately; it's his daughter (who was stationed there with him) who becomes a heroine due to the reassignment.

Meant to be a meaningless title at best, and a very unsubtle insult at worst, he doesn't really expect Reynard to go there, let alone rule. Reynard promptly does so, and ends up becoming a war hero in <em>The Baron of Maleperduys</em> due to the actions he is forced to take in order to survive there.
</li><li> Wedge Antilles in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">Wraith Squadron</a> series is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> enough to take advantage of this trope. To create Wraith Squadron, he deliberately cherry picks skilled pilots who are about to be washed out or court-martialed. This is because it's easier than trying to cherry pick the best of the best, since rival squadron leaders would fight to keep their aces, but wouldn't care if they could get rid of an unwanted pilot.

He'd <em>hoped</em> to trim that to twelve, but for various reasons, only ten were fit to join the squadron at all, forcing him to round out the numbers by adding himself (as leader) and Wes Janson. Still, he had <em>expected</em> that he'd get a lot of irredeemables among the misfits, so he was still pleased that he was able to come up with anything near a full squadron.
</li><li> Sort of also applies to Thrawn, he was reassigned to his old stomping ground in the Unknowns to calm his political opponents. The fact that he made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass">Grand Admiral</a> on his tactical prowess rather than any political links made this a foregone outcome. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Although we find out later that his "exile" was a cover story for a mission to pacify and organize the Unknown Regions... which he did, to the tune of 250 sectors, one quarter of the size of the Galactic Empire at its height, and far larger than the Imperial Remnant by the time our heroes stumble upon it.</span>

She ends up around Nantucket during the Event, and her crew becomes the closest thing that the island has to a military during the turbulent early years of its adjustment to being sent back in time to the Bronze Age, thus making her a power player in the Republic of Nantucket.

The third commander was sent <strong>far</strong> away, across a gulf in space that takes years to travel through- ordered to reclaim colonies that humans had stolen from the Tau. The Ethereals gave him a lot of ships and personnel and figured they'd never have to deal with him again, because all prior wars against humans had ended in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a>.

<ul><li> Zigzagged regarding Zim. The titular character's assigners and rulers, the Tallest, make up a planet past the edge of their star map, and send Zim there so they will never see him again. They're shocked when, six months later, Zim reports back alive and well, saying that he has built his home base on some planet called "Earth". Earth still is a backwater planet with nothing of interest to the Irken race and Zim is ultimately too incompetent to conquer it, meaning that (outside of reports) the Tallest don't have to deal with him as often as before. During "Backseat Drivers Beyond the Stars" this comes back to bite them as Zim hijacks the Tallest's ship in order to bring them to Earth to witness his latest plan for world domination in person, almost killing them both and blowing up their ship in the process. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It backfires on them more permanently in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZimEnterTheFlorpus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZimEnterTheFlorpus">Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus</a></em>, where Zim's antics create the titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">Negative Space Wedgie</a>, which swallows up the <em>entire Irken fleet</em>, Tallest included.</span>
</li><li> This also backfired somewhat with their assignment to Invader Skoodge. The Tallest openly despise him, seemingly even more than they hate Zim. When he shows up for assignment they don't even put up a facade that he's important to them. They assign him to the home planet of the slaughtering Rat People and even provide an illustration of said Rat People preparing to rip Skoodge apart making it abundantly clear that they're sending him there to die. Then Skoodge ends up being the first invader to conquer his planet. While the Tallest have another planet added to their Empire, they still have to deal with the short, ugly, obnoxious, and still living Skoodge.
<ul><li> The Tallest decide to deal with this by giving Skoodge the 'honour' of a brand-new tradition: That the successful invader be loaded into a cannon and fired as the opening shot of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrbitalBombardment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrbitalBombardment">Orbital Bombardment</a> to cleanse the planet. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">If the show hadn't been cancelled</a> Skoodge was planned to survive this as well and eventually be assigned to Zim, making him a double example of this trope given Zim's tendencies for his plans to backfire onto the Irken Empire.

Optimus is assigned the unglamorous job of Space Bridge maintenance, but circumstances conspire to place him and his crew in the middle of events that could change the course of galactic history (and yes, this takes him to Earth). The thing is, Optimus wasn't assigned the crap job out of malice. It's just that with the disaster that lost Elita-1, Ultra Magnus had to make an example out of <em>someone</em>, and with Optimus taking the blame, Ultra Magnus was bound by protocol to do that to him (him getting the assignment was Ultra Magnus pulling strings <em>for</em> Optimus). Played more straight with Bumblebee, as him taking the blame for Bulkhead's clumsiness led to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeidermeyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeidermeyer">Sentinel Prime</a> sending him to work for Optimus. Subverted with Bulkhead, as although he was given the crap job like Bumblebee, because Bulkhead loves Space Bridges, any excuse to work on them makes him happy. Being elevated to the heroes of Cybertron was just a bonus.

Bumblebee was given a position as a mere beat cop after playing a major role in ending the war. At the end of the series, it's revealed that he (and other major Autobots) were given lowly positions so that the corrupt government could denigrate Optimus Prime and keep them from interfering with their plans for galactic conquest. Unfortunately for them, Bumblebee's job devotion and loyalty to Optimus's legacy took him far from Cybertron and put him in a position to foil their, and many other villains', plans.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VicePresidentWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VicePresidentWho">American Vice Presidency</a> is a good way for a political party to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs">get a troublesome member out of the way for at least four years</a>, but there's a serious downside to this strategy, as 8 of those gadflies ended up becoming President. For the first 50 years of the US presidency, every president served out his term(s) without incident, so the Vice Presidency was viewed as a deadend job, with the Secretary of State (a position that provided a rare opportunity for diplomatic experience) as the Heir Apparent to the President. This attitude persisted into the late 19th century, even as illness and assassination began to call it into question.
<ul><li> In 1841 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnTyler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnTyler">John Tyler</a> was selected as William Henry Harrison's Vice President, expecting to spend the next four years in obscurity.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChesterAArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChesterAArthur">Chester A.

Only six months into his term, however, Garfield was assassinated, and Arthur became President. Arthur's ascendency then turned into this for <em>Conkling</em> (who had only chosen Arthur because he was currently unemployed), as he populated his new cabinet with people from all sections of the party in order to unify it; his new cabinet just so happened to exclude Conkling himself, dashing his hopes to become Secretary of State and use that as a springboard to run for President in 1884. On top of that, due to the US government's patronage system laying at the root of Garfield's assassination<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note171gq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note171gq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note171gq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Charles J.

</li><li> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamMcKinley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamMcKinley">William McKinley</a>'s first Vice President, Garret Hobart, died in late 1899, the Republican Party found itself in need of a new nominee for VP in the upcoming election of 1900. Progressive Republicans favored <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, the crusading, grandstanding Governor of New York, as McKinley's running mate. That didn't mean much by itself, but the conservative, Establishment GOP brass <em>also</em> liked Roosevelt: partly because he was a good campaigner (something McKinley was not), partly because he was from the Northeast (like Hobart, who was from New Jersey, and unlike McKinley, a Midwesterner from Ohio), but mostly because Roosevelt was a crusading, grandstanding progressive, and the Vice Presidency would deprive him of the platform the Governorship of the richest, most populous State in the Union had given him to launch crusades and experiments in progressive policymaking. Less than a year later, McKinley was shot, and Teddy was the youngest president in US history. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">Considering that this was the FIFTH vice presidential succession in less than a century, they should have thought better of this plan.</a>
<ul><li> The history lesson wasn't lost on everyone within the Republican Party. Republican National Committee Chairman Mark Hanna famously said "Don't any of you realize there's only one life between that madman and the presidency?" His warning fell on deaf ears and his words on hearing of the ascension are said to be, "I don't believe it! The goddamn cowboy's President!"
</li><li> It is also believed that the "Titans of Industry", including Rockefeller and Carnegie, contributed greatly to McKinley's campaign, believing that he was the best candidate who would greatly support their business practices. After McKinley's death, Roosevelt would spend the next years demanding (and eventually succeeding) that the business monopolies be broken.
</li><li> Furthermore, in 1904, TR became the first "Accidental President" to win a second term on his own merit. To add yet another insult to the initial injury, in 1912 Roosevelt's Bull Moose party got more votes than Republican nominee <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamHowardTaft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamHowardTaft">William Howard Taft</a> (his successor, who TR felt was doing a bad job), causing the election to go to Democrat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WoodrowWilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WoodrowWilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>. This left Taft with the dubious distinction of being the only Republican candidate and the only incumbent president in US history to finish third in a presidential election.

A few years later, however, Harding suddenly died, leaving Coolidge as the new President. Downplayed compared to most of the other examples here, as the party bigwigs were actually quite glad to have the quiet and uncontroversial Coolidge take over just as Harding was being engulfed by the Teapot Dome scandal, but it doubtless left Harding's primary rivals kicking themselves over not trying harder to secure the running-mate slot for themselves, instead of throwing it to Coolidge so as to annoy Harding.

There is a <em>reason</em> for that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeweyDefeatsTruman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeweyDefeatsTruman">Dewey Defeats Truman</a>" headline, after all.</span> for a second term, forcing the party leadership to accept his agenda.

Though Buchanan served (in this as in all things) without distinction, the appointment fooled other Democrats into believing he had foreign policy chops, which lead to a long string of lackluster diplomatic posts, including a stint as Secretary of State. When he ran for president in the chaotic three-way election of 1856, voters assumed this long history indicated competence, and Buchanan's frequent trips abroad meant he had never formed any strong opinions on slavery, immigration, or industrialization, so he didn't alienate as many voters as the Republican or Know-Nothing candidates and carried the day. And the nation then got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">exactly what it had voted for</a>: a milquetoast president without convictions, who spent four years letting the country work itself to the brink of war before leaving office just in time not to have to deal with the consequences. The one time he <em>did</em> speak out on a current issue, endorsing the ruling in <em>Dred Scott v. Sandford</em> before it happened, it backfired spectacularly, as it even enraged Northerners who hadn't otherwise cared for the slavery issue one way or another before. Buchanan is one of the two or three candidates for "worst President in history", and is generally regarded as the ruler of America's only unanimously agreed-upon kakistocracy in history to date, right up there with Czar Nicholas II of Russia and Romulus Augustus, the last Emperor of Rome.

However, at her new job, Lewinsky befriended Linda Tripp and in 1997 confessed to her affair with Clinton on tape. Tripp turned the tape over to Independent Counsel Ken Starr, and the Lewinsky scandal was blown wide open.
</li><li> Pope John XXIII, elected after the nearly two decade reign of Pope Pius XII, was expected to be a "stopgap" Pope. His age (he was almost 77) and health were such that it was expected that he would reign briefly and quietly, and make no lasting impact on the Papacy. While his reign was indeed less than five years, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortLivedBigImpact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortLivedBigImpact">he used that time to call the Second Vatican Council</a>, setting in motion the biggest changes to Catholic worship and church procedures since the Counter-Reformation.
<ul><li> His predecessor to the name, Pope John XXII, may have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">planned</a> his way to the papacy by playing on this trope. After the death of Clement V, the cardinals failed to elect a new Pope for two entire years, because their votes were terminally split between three factions: the Italian bloc (who wanted the Papacy to return to Rome), the Gascon bloc (who were perfectly cool with the Avignon Papacy, as long as they enjoyed the same privileges as under the previous Pope), and the French bloc (who wanted to keep the Pope on French soil but without the special privileges). Lots of corruption and votes for sale all around, and no resolution in sight. Eventually, the King of France had enough of waiting—he needed a Pope doublequick so he could divorce his first wife—and forced a conclave, locking the cardinals up inside a convent with rationed food and water until they made up their minds. According to one story, the future John XXII (then still Monsignor Duèze) waited until his peers were weak with hunger, then pretended to be on his deathbed. He was 72 at the time. The rest of the cardinals promptly elected him, figuring he'd last a few months tops, and then they'd happily be back to the lucrative status quo of bribes-for-votes in a new conclave. Not only did John's reign as Pope last for <em>18 years</em> after that, but he was one of the most activist Popes in history, heavily involving himself in European politics and reorganizing the entire Church.
</li></ul></li><li> "Mr. K" (Yutaka Katayama), president of Nissan USA in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, was originally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> to America (away from corporate in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokyoIsTheCenterOfTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokyoIsTheCenterOfTheUniverse">Tokyo</a>) because of his "rogue" attitude. This eventually backfired for the parent company, as Katayama could talk to American car salesmen as equals, renamed the "Fairlady" sports car 240Z (legend has it he personally swapped the badges over on the first cars on Long Beach docks), and exponentially raised awareness and sales of the Datsun brand in the US... and that meant the brand's sales and reputation have never really recovered from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">name change</a> to "Nissan" after his retirement.
</li><li> When Egyptian President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GamalAbdelNasser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GamalAbdelNasser">Gamal Abdel Nasser</a> died in 1970, the Egyptian elite decided to leave Vice President Anwar Sadat—to whom the presidency had devolved by law—in place as a temporary caretaker, assuming he would be easy to manipulate in office and to force out should it prove necessary. Nasser had chosen his various Veeps on the basis of loyalty, pliability, and consistency: note that neither intelligence nor competence was a qualification, and indeed they were considered something of a drawback. Six months later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Sadat</a> proved to have been concealing both qualities for years, and purged the elites in the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge">Corrective Revolution</a>." His eventful administration included the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabIsraeliConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabIsraeliConflict">Yom Kippur War,</a> negotiation of peace with Israel, and his assassination in 1981.
<ul><li> This brings us to Sadat's successor, Hosni Mubarak. Sadat had followed Nasser's lead where Veep selection was concerned, so when he was assassinated, the whole government was scared of what the idiot at the top might do. If Mubarak had started any Sadat-style Machiavellian games, the military brass would likely have pushed back <em>hard</em>. However, Mubarak proved to care little for radical plans or purges, or anything other than enriching himself and staying in power. He was content to let Egypt run itself... into the ground, as it happened.
</li></ul></li><li> The German government tried to keep <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and his NSDAP in line by handing him the job of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">Chancellor</a>, figuring that the DNVP politicians in his cabinet could rein him in. It ended badly. It turned out to be a literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler">Springtime for Hitler</a>, as the subsequent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyAuthority">Enabling Act</a> gave him near-total control over the government. Hitler even saw through a second attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">reassign him to political Antarctica</a> when the Reichstag offered him the presidency after Hindenburg's death. As President, he would have been required to uphold the constitution, so instead he simply declared that the powers of the presidency were <em>transferred to</em> the chancellorship until he saw fit to appoint a new President (when he did, it was upon his own impending suicide).
</li><li> In 1939, the junior German commander Erich von Manstein argued that the General Staff's operational plan for the <em>Fall Gelb</em> (Netherlands-Belgium-France) offensive would never work as intended. He wasn't wrong: the chief of the General Staff, a covert opponent of Nazism, was quietly ensuring that the plan would be easily countered by Allied strategists, resulting in stalemate at the French border rather than a prolonged occupation. For his trouble, Manstein was assigned to command an infantry corps away from the main action. However, this meant he attended a reception for new corps commanders in early 1940, where he met Hitler over drinks and explained his alternative plan directly to the Führer. Hitler liked Manstein's ideas, which led to a decisive German victory over France and five long years of grueling occupation.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar">Julius Caesar</a> was sent over to Transalpine Gaul, a far-flung province mostly composed of constantly rebellious barbarians, so that Pompey in Rome wouldn't have to deal with him. Unfortunately, Caesar ended up conquering the <em>rest</em> of Gaul (modern day France), which made him so popular back home that he was able to gain enough support to overthrow Pompey.
<ul><li> Caesar was quite happy to be assigned to Transalpine Gaul as:
</li></ul><ol><li> He couldn't be taken to court over his massive debts while employed by the republic.
</li><li> He was allowed to <em>pacify</em> much of North-West Europe.
</li><li> He was originally allotted Italy by the Senate as his proconsular province, which would have given him nothing to do, no way of making money to pay off the aforementioned debts, and no way of making a name for himself.
</li><li> He also got Illyria and Cisalpine Gaul.
</li></ol><ul><li> Caesar had originally been assigned to look after the local province but this was in reality an insult, known as looking after the "woods and country paths". It actually took a lot of political skill to secure the impressive Transalpine, Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum for five years. Pompey was influential in Julius Caesar securing it, but it was because he was allied with Caesar at the time.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoléon Bonaparte</a>'s entire republican career was this: as far as the Directoire back in France was concerned, the Italian campaign was a sideshow just to keep the southern border vaguely covered, but he ended up winning the war while the rest of Europe went "huh?". Egypt was also a sideshow, and an attempt to get rid of him via bullet or tropical disease; he came back at the perfect time and position to hasten the fall of the Directoire and take over.
<ul><li> Although Napoleon himself didn't consider Egypt a sideshow, and, indeed, was furious when the combined efforts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritsWithBattleships" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritsWithBattleships">Royal Navy officers</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HoratioNelson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HoratioNelson">Horatio Nelson</a> (who destroyed his fleet at the Battle of the Nile and forced him to leave his army to British prison hulks) and Sidney Smith (who trained a force of Ottoman irregulars, British sailors, and Royal Marines into a formidable unit that repulsed Napoleon's attack on Acre) prevented him making anything useful of his African campaign. Indeed, their successes are what inculcated his lifelong hatred of the Royal Navy, and he later commented of Smith: "That man made me miss my destiny".
</li></ul></li><li> The 332nd Fighter Group from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, better known as the Tuskegee Airmen, were trained by racist instructors who washed trainees out for the very smallest of mistakes, in an attempt to prove that African-Americans were unsuited to be fighter pilots. It backfired spectacularly, and the result was a hand-picked elite that wiped the floor with everything it met. Their fighter group held the best bomber protection record of all USAAF fighter groups in the European Theater in WWII, with a loss rate of roughly half the average. That is, they lost 25 bombers to enemy fighters while the average loss rate for USAAF fighter groups in Europe was about 50.
</li><li> A political example: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephMcCarthy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephMcCarthy">Joseph McCarthy</a> was on his way out of the Senate after allegations of bribery surfaced in 1948. He most likely was looking at impeachment or at the very least censure, but either way, his political career was over. Realizing what an embarrassment McCarthy was to the Republican Party, the party leaders tasked with fundraising event schedules assigned him to speak in Wheeling, West Virginia in 1950, the most obscure place they could think of sending him. The speech he delivered gave us the infamous quote "I have here in my hand a list of 52 members of the Communist Party in the State Department" and seven years of McCarthyism. The stunt served as a political life preserver (since he could accuse any opponent of being a Communist), and the subsequent witch hunt actually made the job of finding Soviet spies <em>harder</em>. McCarthy was effectively bulletproof until 1954, when the ArmyMcCarthy hearings discredited his approach.
</li><li> While not so much a "backfire," there are many examples of troops sent for a rest or for training to a "quiet" sector and then being <em>exactly</em> the right men on the spot to deal with a surprise attack. Two from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NazisWithGnarlyWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NazisWithGnarlyWeapons">Nazis with Gnarly Weapons</a> alone are the 352nd Division, which just happened to be practicing anti-amphibious tactics at Omaha Beach, and the 9th and 10th SS Armored Divisions which were sent to Arnhem to regroup, right where the unequipped-to-deal-with-tanks 1st Airborne Division was about to drop. In both cases they were notable exceptions to the "teenagers and old men" the Allies had expected to meet.
</li><li> "Bad" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirPutin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirPutin">Vlad Putin</a> became Prime Minister in 1999. At the time, it was a thankless, mostly useless position, during a time of Russian turmoil (he was the <em>fifth</em> person to take up the position that year). It was expected to ruin his career like it had done to so many before him. It... didn't.
</li><li> Chiune Sugihara was a Japanese diplomat who, because of his mouthing off to superiors (a huge taboo in Japan at the time), got reassigned to remote Lithuania. From there he wrote himself into the history books by saving 6000 Jews from the Nazis.
</li><li> Father Jean Vianney was not thought well of by his teachers in seminary, who considered him a slow student, a poor homilist and a substandard candidate for the priesthood. Still he was ordained, leaving the question of "what to do with Pere Jean?" It was decided to send him to the backwater town of Ars, which had such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">reputation for ungodliness</a> after the then-recent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">revolution</a> (wherein the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Constitution_of_the_Clergy">Civil Constitution of the Clergy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and then the policy of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dechristianization_of_France_during_the_French_Revolution">dechristianization<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> had driven the majority of France's most committed clerics into hiding, exile, or the guillotine) that his superiors figured he would at least find it hard to <em>lose</em> any souls. When he arrived, Father Jean took control of matters and found his priestly calling in the confessional. He became a legend in France, with people coming from far and wide to have the tireless confessor give them spiritual advice. Today, the "slow student" and "poor homilist" who was intended to have merely watched as Ars disintegrated further, is known as <em>Saint</em> Jean Vianny, patron saint of parish priests.
</li><li> More or less the case with Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte. Napoleon couldn't stand him and was happy to see him become the Crown Prince of Sweden, a country that had just suffered a devastating defeat at Russia's hands — the Parliament had chosen Bernadotte, but he wanted to have Napoleon's approval. Surely Sweden had devolved to such a minor role in European politics that Bernadotte couldn't do any harm even if he wanted to... But the new prince quickly took his adopted country's affairs in hand and ended up playing a key part in Napoleon's defeat. His direct descendants <em>still</em> occupy the Swedish throne as of 2017. Nobody but aristocracy nerds has ever heard of the current claimant to the Napoleonic dynasty....
</li><li> Qian Xuesen was a Chinese scientist working on the Manhattan Project who was accused of communist sympathies after refusing to work on nuclear weapons that could be used against China. He was stripped of his security clearance, kept under house arrest, and later expelled from the United States on the grounds that he was a national security threat. Afterwards, he was crucial in developing the Chinese missile program, including those nuclear weapons which threatened the national security of the United States. Oops!
</li><li> There used to be a saying in German politics, "Hast du einen Opa, dann schick ihn nach Europa" - If you have a granddad (old tatter) send him to Europe (put him in a EU position). However, Martin Schulz, whose prior highest elected office was Mayor of Würselen<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6236n');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6236n" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6236n');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> never heard of Würselen? Exactly!</span>, soon established a high profile for himself in the EU parliament and ultimately came to be known even among the rank and file members of his party when he rose to president of the EU parliament and candidate for head of the EU commission (narrowly losing that election to Jean Claude Juncker) before he was chosen as a stopgap to run the 2017 campaign of his social democratic party as candidate for chancellor. He managed to poll higher than his party had in years, but then his support somehow collapsed over the summer and as of November 2017 he's still head of his party but seems far from any political power.... for now....
</li><li> Angela Merkel started her political career in post-reunification Germany on the virtue of her being a woman from the East and Helmut Kohl needing a woman from the East. She was made minister of women and youth and later the environment, two positions that were universally regarded as afterthoughts, but which had the distinct advantage of not attracting major scandal<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note71nuh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note71nuh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note71nuh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Merkel <em>was</em> involved in drafting a rather controversial bottle deposit law and with the nuclear waste facilities but both those scandals did not come to light until years later and are rarely seen as being tied to her</span>, so she gained inside experience of government but no "baggage" of any faction within or outside her party opposing any policy position she held. In 1998 the CDU lost the elections and Merkel lost her job, but slowly but surely she managed to eliminate inner-party rivals, in part because many of them - such as Kohl or Wolfgang Schäuble - were involved in a political donation scandal in which she hadn't had a possibility to become involved due to her position. Her coup de grace however happened in 2002. Back then it was widely expected that Gerhard Schröder would lose the upcoming elections, so who would be candidate for chancellor would be immensely important. Merkel, however, "graciously" backed down in a now-famous breakfast with Edmund Stoiber of the CSU held in his home in Wolfratshausen. What Merkel seem to have intuitively known was that Schröder is a damn good political campaigner and whatever his faults, he had a keen instinct that the German electorate was decisively <em>not</em> in favor of the Iraq War then already seeming likely. Schröder also showed "crisis manager" capabilities when he personally flew to help flooding victims in East Germany. So Merkel by reassigning herself to political Antarctica in 2002 was poised to become candidate for chancellor following the next elections and even Schröder's campaigning in the 2005 early elections could not save him as a substantial faction of his party broke away under Oskar Lafontaine, an erstwhile friend and colleague but now bitter political enemy of Schröder. Merkel basically just had to wait for the SPD to give into the inevitable and walk to a Grand Coalition under her leadership.
</li><li> An indirect example is Jeff Sessions, as his reassignment has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes">caused all sorts of problems</a> for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">new boss</a>. Trump offered Sessions, an early supporter of his campaign, the post of United States Attorney General. Sessions accepted the post and resigned his Senate seat, leaving Alabama's Republican governor to select a replacement until an election could be held. Seems okay so far, right? Unfortunately, Governor Robert Bentley was currently under investigation for inappropriate usage of campaign funds and inappropriate relations with a woman other than his wife, so anybody he picked would likely also be tainted by scandal. Bentley selected Alabama State Attorney General Luther Strange for the seat (coincidentally also letting Bentley select a new Attorney General to investigate him). Strange stood for the Republican primary but lost to Roy Moore, a former justice of the Alabama Supreme Court who was twice kicked out of office for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">refusing to obey court orders</a> and who also held a number of extreme positions on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw">the Constitution</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist">religion</a>, along with a number of accusations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt">inappropriate conduct with underage girls</a>. Net Result: Moore narrowly loses to Doug Jones, and Alabama sends its first Democrat to the Senate since 1992, cutting the Republican majority there to one seat and energizing the Democratic Party nationwide. If Sessions had stayed put, he would almost certainly have been reelected when his seat next came up in 2020. Instead, he found himself <em>de facto</em> fired from the AG position and running <em>behind</em> (of all people) the former head coach of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CollegiateAmericanFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CollegiateAmericanFootball">Auburn Tigers football team</a> in the Republican primary for his old Senate seat against in the middle of a pandemic that has done nothing but make the GOP look bad, with Doug Jones laughing from the sidelines.
<ul><li> And it gets a bit worse for Trump: During his confirmation hearings, Sessions denied having any contact with Russian government officials, only to be caught in a lie when it was found that he had met with the Russian Ambassador more than once, and so was forced to recuse himself from the investigation of possible Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. This left Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to appoint former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a Special Counsel<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note87dn3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note87dn3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note87dn3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">after the controversial firing of FBI director James Comey, which lead to accusations against Trump of obstruction of justice, especially after Trump basically admitted he fired Comey to make the investigation go away because it was undermining his administration (and one could obviously point out that an innocent man would let the investigation run its course, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHelpingYourCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHelpingYourCase">Trump instead made himself look like he was suspicious and/or so egotistical and thin-skinned that he couldn't stand letting it continue any longer</a>)</span>, with a very broad mandate to investigate anything related Russian election meddling, and thus keeping the scandal from going away anytime soon, nevermind multiple associates of Trump being investigated, arrested and even becoming informants for the investigation.
</li></ul></li><li> Nicodemo "Little Nicky" Scarfo, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMafia">boss of the Philadelphia Mob from 1981 to 1991</a>, was once exiled to Atlantic City by Angelo Bruno in 1963 for two reasons: one, he insulted Bruno's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheConsigliere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheConsigliere">consigliere Joe Rugnetta</a> by not only refusing to marry his daughter, but also badmouthing her by calling her ugly. In response, an enraged Rugnetta sought to have Scarfo killed, but Bruno, known for preferring cooperation with violence as a last resort, declines it out of respect to Scarfo's uncles, the Piccolo brothers, who were old-time mobsters. Second, Scarfo pled guilty to manslaughter for fatally stabbing a longshoreman with a knife over an argument in 1963 and spent 10 months behind bars. In response to these events, Scarfo was sent down to Atlantic City to oversee the Philly Mob's operations there. Ironically, being banished there worked in Scarfo's favor, as various rogue elements within the family conspired to overthrow Bruno over the years, and he was killed in 1980 by renegade henchmen for kowtowing before the New York mafia over a dispute regarding Atlantic City and not letting the family deal in narcotics, but the renegades were later killed by the Genovese crime family for killing a boss without the Mafia Commission's approval. Also, Atlantic City, which had been in decline since the 1950s, once again rejuvenates when New Jersey legalized gambling, and this enabled Scarfo and his nephew Phil Leonetti to cash in on the construction boom and the labor unions. Bruno's successor, Philip "Chicken Man" Testa, promotes Scarfo to consigliere, but Testa also met a violent end like Bruno a year later, when another renegade faction conspired to kill him. These hits would vault Scarfo to the position of boss in 1981 after Testa was killed, but his tumultuous reign was frequently marred by violence, internal turf wars, indictments and general incompetence, leading to the family's decline after Scarfo was stripped of his title in 1991.
</li><li> Joseph Stalin was seemingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs">Kicked Upstairs</a> when given the position of General Secretary in the CPSU. It was one mostly seen as worthless because it lacked any real ideological power. Stalin was jokingly nicknamed "Comrade Card-Index" by his rivals. However, what they failed to realize is that despite the position having very little ideological power, it had a LOT of practical power, allowing him to fill up positions with his own supporters. The position of General Secretary was the title of the de facto ruler of the Soviet Union up through 1990 before being replaced by the President of the Soviet Union (on August 29, 1991 the General Secretary of the CPSU position was abolished along with the Communist Party).
</li><li> Admiral Yi Sun-Sin, known for having built the Korean navy from basically nothing as his country was invaded by Japan, and having never lost a battle or a single ship, started his career so successfully as to make his superior jealous. He was subsequently framed as a deserter, imprisoned, tortured and stripped of his rank. He was then allowed to join again as a private. From that post, he quickly rose again, providing both competence and leadership during the chaos of the Japanese invasion, and becoming the main actor in the Korean victory.
</li><li> Sir Isaac Newton's tenure as Master of the Mint. At the time, the Mint was considered self-running, and the position as Master was a sinecure handed out to people like Newton so the Crown had an excuse to pay them a salary so that they, in turn, could do more interesting stuff like (in Newton's case) maths and astronomy. Newton, however, did what no-one expected, and took the make-work job dead seriously. He cracked down hard on counterfeiters, invented the process of milling coin edges to make shaving coins impossible, and tracked down and led raids on counterfeiters' workshops. He was also a driving force in moving England away from a bimetallic currency standard, and onto a gold standard, a move which was about the only thing that prevented the economy of the British Isles from collapsing completely when the Spanish flooded the metal market with cheap New World gold. Sir Isaac was, in fact, knighted because of his work at the mint and not for his scientific endeavours, and his tomb in Westminster Abbey is adorned with financial motifs, not scientific ones.
</li><li> In the American Civil War, Union General Lew Wallace was stripped of his command for his performance the Battle of Shiloh, in which he seemingly sent his 6,000-man division every direction except towards the enemy, not arriving on the battlefield until 7 pm on the first day as the fighting was dying down. Though he would never receive another front-line command, his backwater assignments would still give him new chances at glory. After Shiloh, Wallace was assigned to the military Department of Ohio, in which he was placed in charge of the defense of Cincinnati. Faced with an incoming Confederate army advancing from Braxton Bragg's Kentucky invasion, Wallace was able to assemble an odd mix of regulars, militia, black laborers, police officers, and civilian volunteers into fighting force so large and formidable that the Confederate army ultimately decided against attacking the city. Then in 1864, Lew Wallace led 6,000 troops at the Battle of Monocacy against Jubal Early's 15,000 man invasion force. Faced with an army more then twice his size, Wallace's men were eventually overwhelmed and forced to retreat to Baltimore, but they had held up Early for a full day, giving the Union time they needed to bring up reinforcements to secure Washington D. C. against Early's threat. Today, Wallace is best remembered for writing the book "Ben Hur" after the war.
