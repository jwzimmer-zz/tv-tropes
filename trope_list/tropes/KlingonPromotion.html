</div></div><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>In an organization with a ranked hierarchal structure, you can get a promotion by showing aptitude for the work, impressing senior ranked individuals, fulfilling certain criteria, having a place open up due to retirement, resignation or death, and probably kissing a lot of ass. Or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKillItYouBoughtIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKillItYouBoughtIt">you can kill them and take their job</a>. The former is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellThisIsNotThatTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellThisIsNotThatTrope">not this trope.</a> The latter is.
</p><p>This is a sister trope to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKillItYouBoughtIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKillItYouBoughtIt">You Kill It, You Bought It</a>. However, in that one, you kill someone, purposefully or accidentally, and gain something of theirs (whether you want it or not). That could be a physical object or something more metaphysical, like a role in life or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse">curse</a>, and you dont need to have a system that puts the character in a position to get the job. This requirement of a rank to get into for a Klingon Promotion means it will show up in connection to different sorts of organisations.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>For instance, the Klingon Promotion will turn up in organisations that favour ruthlessness and the heavy dominance of a leader. Hence the trope name referring to the Klingons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>, who are often portrayed as accepting assassination of a superior (with varying justification) as a legitimate option for career advancement. Youll get it in royal or noble lines of succession where individuals can obsess over the fact that if only 72 people would die in a very short period, they could become King.
</p><p>A common subtrope is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChallengingTheChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChallengingTheChief">Challenging the Chief</a> trope where the role of boss goes to whoever's the biggest badass, who can kill or defeat any other badass in ritual combat.
</p><p>Perhaps the focus will be on a character who uses this method often to get ahead in the world. They could easily then be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">The Starscream</a>, and if we get the chance to follow them going through several stations in life, advancing themselves with cunning, guile, and possibly the odd bottle of arsenic, we might get to see them as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> and maybe a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">magnificent one</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>This trope tends to enforce its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperTrope">Super-Trope</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperiorSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperiorSuccessor">Superior Successor</a>.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">Asskicking Equals Authority</a> is when you get a <em>society</em> that works based on this trope. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilPrince">The Evil Prince</a> tends to see the world this way, due to his position. Occasionally, a superior can forestall it with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillMeNowOrForeverStayYourHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillMeNowOrForeverStayYourHand">Kill Me Now, or Forever Stay Your Hand</a>. May result in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow">You Are in Command Now</a> if the replacement is lacking in qualifications for the position they gain and/or pulls off a Klingon Promotion <em>by accident</em>.
</p><p>In practical use, this is a dangerous gamble on the part of the killer, since if he kills a superior who has popular support, he will most likely be killed very quickly himself before he gets an opportunity to enjoy his new power. Also, most don't take well to an unproven upstart killing a superior who has experience and the wisdom to rule effectively, especially when it threatens the status quo. However, no one will mind the killing of an officer who has failed too many times, as long as the killer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow">knows what he is getting himself into now and everything that goes with it</a>. Most of the time, an individual who decides on Klingon Promotion probably does so with the backing of parties sponsoring his actions, thus protecting him from retaliation (leverage). And even then, there still might not be anything to protect them from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather">certain avengers</a> for whom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">It's Personal</a>. This is similar to how most real-life politicians rely on the support of others to get them in a position of power and keep them there.
</p><p>Fictional societies that function on this rule often display <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">its downsides</a>. When leadership is predicated solely on being quicker on the draw than the opponent, there is no guarantee that any leader is at all qualified for the position they want, resulting in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrantTakesTheHelm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrantTakesTheHelm">repeated misrule</a>. Long-term planning is next to impossible since leadership changes hands often and violently, leading to stagnation. Nobody can count on anyone else not to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">betray them on a whim</a>, which tends to make morale drop to rock bottom. Worst of all, no leader is likely to have the time, ability, or even motivation to improve the situation, since they are too busy fending off usurpers. Woe betide the organization when more than one candidate attempts a power play at once: the organization will likely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar">tear itself apart</a> before one of the usurpers comes out on top. This is a common cause of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWillFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWillFail">collapse for evil organizations</a>. Expect a moral about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfTrust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfTrust">trust</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">comradery</a> to come from heroes who encounter these situations.
</p><p>If someone did it by killing the former leader stealthily and impersonating them, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAndReplace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAndReplace">Kill and Replace</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, there are three ways to become a Captain. One requires achieving Bankai and demonstrating it to at least three of the other Captains (including the Captain-Commander); one requires receiving recommendations from at least six of the sitting Captains, and having approval from at least three of the remaining seven; the last, and the most ruthless one, is to kill a sitting Captain in a one-on-one in front of two hundred members of the Captain's division. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">11th Division</a> exclusively use this final option, partially because being Kenpachi requires the shinigami holding the title to be the strongest in his generation of captains.

Played with in that he didn't kill his father for that purpose but was quite happy to take advantage of this trope afterwards. Further played with in that none of the nobility and fellow royal family members recognized his authority until he used his Geass powers to force them to accept his rule. This is despite the fact that Charles himself became the 98th Holy Britannian Emperor in the exact same manner.</span>
<ul><li> Earlier, this is attempted by Kewell Soresi.

Fortunately for Orange Boy, Viletta and Suzaku intervene to save him.

Meanwhile, DarkKnightmon, after gaining the X-Antibody, wants to become one of the Seven Great Demon Lords himself. Since all seven have already been identified, he can't exactly lay claim to the title any other way unless one of those seven is out of the way. (The fact DarkKnightmon is hopelessly outclassed even by the weakest of them apparently is not a deterrent to his ambitions.)

Zabi patriarch Degwin becomes the leader of Zeon in the first place by having Zeon Zum Deikun assassinated (or getting really lucky; it's never <em>proven</em> that Degwin ordered the assassination, or for that matter that he even <em>was</em> assassinated in the first place given that he had pre-existing health conditions that could have caused his fatal collapse, but several characters believe it to be fact, including Deikun's son Casval aka <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Char</span> who uses it as justification for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a>). Then, late in the series, Degwin gets a taste of his own medicine when Gihren uses the Solar Ray to kill him before he can sue for peace, thus becoming Zeon's new leader. Gihren's victory is <em>much</em> shorter-lived than his father's, though, as his sister Kycilia in turn confronts him with his crime before shooting him dead on the bridge in full view of all the ship's crew. She then succeeds Gihren as Zeon's leader before meeting her end in the Battle of A Boa Qu.

</li><li> The original Marvel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers">Transformers</a></em> comic series had a lengthy chain of Klingon promotions in the Decepticon army. What made it truly bizarre was that <em>Starscream never fulfilled the trope.</em>
<ul><li> At the end of the original limited series, Megatron and the Decepticons were left crippled and helpless. Shockwave turned up while the Autobots were celebrating their victory and blew everyone away, deemed Megatron incompetent, imprisoned him and assumed command.
</li><li> Megatron eventually escaped and reclaimed his leadership position... only to lose it <em>again</em>, when Shockwave preyed on his paranoid fear of the (then-presumed-dead) Optimus Prime. Megatron blew himself up and Shockwave again took command.
</li><li> Ratbat, essentially the Decepticon supply manager, showed up on Earth to ensure that Shockwave was using Decepticon resources efficiently (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">It Makes Sense in Context</a>). Shockwave ends up presumed dead fighting the Autobots because Ratbat doesn't want to waste gas fishing him out of Earth's atmosphere. Ratbat assumes command.
</li><li> Scorponok, a powerful Decepticon leader in his own right, arrives on Earth around that time and operates independently for a bit, eventually jockeying for supremacy with Ratbat. Scorponok eventually shoots Ratbat in the back and assumes full command of the Decepticons on Earth.
</li><li> Back on Cybertron, Megatron eventually returned and reclaimed command of the Decepticons there. After Ratchet caught him in an exploding transdimensional portal, Thunderwing assumed command.
</li><li> Scorponok fends off assassination attempts by Megatron, Starscream, and Shockwave, only to bite it fighting Unicron. In addition, Thunderwing (who'd been MIA since he'd stolen the Creation Matrix) was killed by Unicron as well. Bludgeon, up until now a basic grunt, assumes command because Megatron, Starscream, and Shockwave are all MIA, and no one else left on Cybertron is qualified. (Shockwave and Starscream decided to steal the Ark and leave the dying planet, inadvertently taking Megatron with them.)
</li><li> Bludgeon lasts into the subsequent G2 series but is killed by a rebuilt Megatron, who stays in charge until the series is canceled.
</li><li> The Marvel UK series complicated things further, thanks to its post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformersTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformersTheMovie">Movie</a> future timeline, the Galvatron from that timeline traveling to the present day of the comics, and featuring several Decepticon leaders on Cybertron jockeying for position and getting killed off.

<ul><li> The Sith "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfTwo">Rule of Two</a>" is exactly this trope. Every Sith Lord takes an apprentice. An apprentice can only become a Sith Lord himself with the death of his master, even if the apprentice is the one who kills him. He then customarily takes on an apprentice of his own and the cycle continues. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">Such betrayal is not only common,</a> it's actually <em>expected</em> of the apprentice. If the master has become weak or foolish enough to be killed by his apprentice, then obviously it was time for a new Sith Lord to take over anyway. And if he fails to take advantage of a (real) opportunity to replace his master, he's clearly not ready to be the Sith Lord. But woe unto the green apprentice who tries too soon to take his master's place. Especially if the master is still relatively young enough to afford the time to train a new apprentice. It may not necessarily cost the apprentice his life, but he will likely learn a very painful lesson.
</li><li> The funny thing is that, according to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars Legends</a></em>, the "Rule of Two" was actually made to curtail <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">this behavior</a>. Before it, the Sith organization <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar">practically ate itself</a> since <em>everybody</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">constantly tried to pull this trope at once</a>; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">the rule was instituted by the sole survivor of one such moment gone horribly bad.</a> It was also noted somewhere that without the rule, several existing Sith apprentices could team up to kill their master... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">and then promptly try and kill each other</a>. The last remaining would be far weaker than his master (only better or luckier than his accomplices), thus weakening the Sith overall relative to the Jedi.
</li><li> In the films themselves, we have the Skywalkers: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em>, Anakin (the eventual Vader) kills Dooku,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0vkcc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0vkcc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0vkcc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which itself is an inversion, being a Klingon <em>Demotion</em> for Dooku as he is killed on Sidious' order to free up his position for Anakin</span> current Sith apprentice  which, unbeknownst to him at first, put him on the path to become the new one. Then, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>, Darth Sidious (Emperor Palpatine) wants Luke to kill Anakin and become the <em>next</em> apprentice...
</li><li> Ironically, again according to the Legends, both Sidious and Vader would try to violate the rule themselves  Vader by explicitly taking a secret apprentice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed">The Force Unleashed</a></em>, then Sidious by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">intending to cast even Luke aside and rule alone, immortal and eternally</span>. And <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarthPlagueis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarthPlagueis">Darth Plagueis</a></em> reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sidious had taken Darth Maul as his apprentice and trained him for years <em>before</em> actually ascending to the rank of master himself. He then corrected the violation of the Rule of Two by murdering Plagueis.</span> (The other Force-sensitive agents they use don't count, as they aren't trained in Sith tradition, and some may not even have been aware of it.)
<ul><li> The Sith who formalized the Rule of Two also anticipated <em>this</em>, and fully expected it to be self-correcting. When a second apprentice gets brought into the mix, normally either the current apprentice is about to kill his master, or the current master is about to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">dispose of the current apprentice in favor of a more useful one</a>. Or, if the second apprentice is unworthy, <em>he</em> gets to be the one discarded. In all those scenarios, the Rule of Two is restored. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Indeed, at the end of his reign as Sith Lord, Darth Bane and his apprentice Darth Zannah <em>each</em> had picked a new apprentice of their own. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">Bane was worried that Zannah was going soft because she hadn't tried to kill him and thus decided to replace her, while Zannah had chosen that exact moment to overthrow Bane.</a> Ultimately, Zannah killed Bane and took Bane's would-be second apprentice as her own.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Interestingly, it appears from the Legends that numerous Sith cults remained isolated and secret, never challenging or revealing themselves to the active <em>Two</em> at any given time, in case the line ever failed. For example, while it never actually played out until the very end of the thousand years of the Rule of Two, there was always the risk that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutualKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutualKill">the master and apprentice would kill each other</a>.

</li><li> This was endemic in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>, particularly in the earlier books:
<ul><li> Because the number of people who can hold any rank in the Unseen University was fixed by tradition, nobody could be promoted unless a slot above them opened up through the death or promotion of a more senior wizard. As a result, creating an open slot by killing a higher-ranking wizard was the preferred means of promotion (via the "Dead Man's Pointy Shoes" rule). The catch, however, is that wizards usually have so many magic wards that they can take a full-on thaumonuclear explosion to the face, forcing them to resort to more practical means, making daily UU living for high-ranking wizards an exercise in forensics. <br/><br/>This came to an end, however, when Mustrum Ridcully became Archchancellor and proved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">nigh unkillable</a>; and, Wizards being creatures of laziness, they soon came to realize a less competitive work environment is rather enjoyable. Added to this, now the senior faculty are all settled and long-standing members, they've probably realized in the old days each one of them would be a target for an up-and-comer; therefore it is in their best interests to act as a group now. It probably helps that a generation's worth of ambitious wizards killed each other off in <em>Sourcery</em>; the faculty originally brought Ridcully in to lead them because nobody was left who wanted the job.
</li><li> There is also a persistent rumor that if a student Assassin manages to inhume one of his teachers, he will be graduated to full member of the Assassin's Guild on the spot. But since it is <em>definitely</em> known that trying to inhume one of the teachers and <em>failing</em> will get the student expelled not only from the guild but from life as well, no actual attempts have occurred during any of the books.
</li><li> Also, Vetinari (maybe), although in his case he replaced <strong>the replacement</strong> of the Patrician he assassinated.
</li><li> For that matter, back when Ankh-Morpork still had kings, there were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighTurnoverRate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighTurnoverRate">a number of monarchs with very brief reigns</a>. The record was King Loyala the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledMidSentence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledMidSentence">Aargh</a>, who ruled for all of 1.4 seconds before being killed by his successor.
</li><li> Way back in the first book, the Thieves' Guild apparently worked like this, since the leader's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo">Number Two</a> apparently lost an eye to the leader's pet ravens.

The accepted way to become the minotaur emperor is to defeat the previous emperor in a duel. However, an Imperial Duel is an <em>incredibly</em> formalized affair, the incumbent emperor can ignore challenges if he wants to (though doing this too often/ignoring a challenger with a strong enough reputation will quickly earn an emperor a reputation for cowardice and/or corruption, not a good thing for the leader of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">Proud Warrior Race</a> to have) and if the emperor is killed <em>outside</em> of an Imperial Duel, that's assassination and isn't well-regarded. Doesn't hurt that the emperor's main job is to be a sterling example of minotaur values for the people to look up to and be inspired by — though he sets policy in a broad sense, most of the day-to-day running of the empire is carried out by the bureaucracy.

Every man there is a salt slave, with the leader being one Tz'shal who advises the new arrivals that anyone who wishes to be first at Klima need only kill him.

However, it's made explicitly clear that such duels are <em>very</em> formal, and must be officially declared, carried out in front of witnesses, and conducted according to strict standards of honorable combat — a breach of any of the above, the duel's results aren't valid and no power changes hands.

Every ranked warrior is given a number with the lowest numbers indicating the best fighters. To progress through the ranks you have to defeat everyone ahead of you one rank at a time. If the current holder of a rank is unavailable, you wait till he/she returns or is declared dead. This trope gets inverted as you get to the top ranks as at those positions the fights are merely a test of skill rather than a fight to the death and actually killing your opponent is considered to be extremely bad form. If you show yourself to be a superior fighter the current rank holder will give up the position willingly since for the Seguleh leadership, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">Asskicking Equals Authority</a> is a religion. A full inversion occurs when it comes to the top position of the One. The position cannot be challenged for and is a lifelong appointment.

Executives of the mega-corporations that control the world compete for promotion in road duels. You don't have to <em>kill</em> the person you're challenging, though a lot of that depends on the corporate culture of whoever you're working for. The custom came about during a time of economic crisis. The economy was fluctuating so badly there was no means of telling who was competent or not, so executives were being laid off just because they were late for work.

Before that, she "predicts" that he'll be killed by one of his lieutenants (after reading the mind of one doubting lieutenant). Years later, Nova is tracked down by a Ghost Academy recruiter. When the gang leader (who has gone insane over months due to the abuse of a telepathy blocker) is about to shoot him, Nova mind-controls the doubting lieutenant and has him shoot the leader in the head.

In two cases, it's the Klingons, who apparently roughly keep to the rules mentioned (with the rather important provisos that you could pretty much always accuse the Regent of incompetence since something is always going wrong <em>somewhere</em> in the Klingon Empire, and that the Klingons apparently regard any Klingon who can get in a position to formally challenge the Regent as qualified).

</li><li> Mirror-Spock specifically mentions that he doesn't want to become captain of the <em>Enterprise</em> over Kirk's body, as Mirror-Kirk has many friends in the fleet, and Spock's command (and life) would be extremely short.

</li><li> Mirror-Spock also cautions Sulu, who rightfully points out that the order would fall on him next should Spock fail to carry out his orders.

Only a direct subordinate can make the challenge, and only after a severe infraction (cowardice, extreme failure, dereliction of duty). In the same episode, Worf challenges Martok for fleeing the Jem'hadar. It's a ploy not unlike Riker's, as Martok had been badly affected by his experience as a Dominion prisoner—being challenged and defeating Worf restores Martok's fighting spirit and that of the demoralized crew. Once he realizes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelToBeKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelToBeKind">Worf was trying to help him</a>, Martok declares him a sworn brother of his House.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Clans</a> practice a weirdly sanctioned form of this trope. If a Clan warrior believes their superior is incompetent, as a warrior they have a right to challenge the suitability of their commanding officer's qualifications to command. This usually comes in the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialByCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialByCombat">Trial by Combat</a>, and while death in trial is not the goal, it's also not uncommon, either, since losing such a trial is usually a career-killer regardless of whether you're the challenger or challenged. The catch is, though, that merely defeating or killing a superior officer is not enough; the officer above them must approve of the subsequent promotion, though seeing as how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">Asskicking Equals Authority</a> among the Clans, an officer losing to their subordinate is usually evidence enough that they were not worthy of commanding that subordinate. Also, as they detest subterfuge due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a>, Clan warriors will <em>not</em> simply backstab or assassinate a superior officer in a clandestine manner to advance themselves as a general rule, and those who do are considered dangerous aberrations by the rest of Clan society, often hunted down as no better than bandits and pirates. Klingon Promotions in Clan society are done <em>above</em> board, thank you very much.
</li><li> It's never been conclusively proven, but something like this is <em>very</em> heavily implied to be the reason that the second commander of Wilson's Hussars, Michael Langstrom, died suddenly in battle after his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure">continued incompetence</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">blatant cowardice</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">endless blame-shifting</a> led to the destruction of most of the unit.

<ul><li> For drow of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em> setting, treachery is an acceptable method of achieving advancement, provided the assassin does not get caught. No different from any other culture perhaps, except that it's oft-cited conventional wisdom and the word of their goddess Lloth. This doesn't apply only to individuals, but to whole noble clans as well. If one noble family becomes extinct, every lower-ranking clan moves up in the hierarchy.
<ul><li> The twist, however, is that any noble who survives can report the murders. Which usually leads to <em>every</em> other noble clan teaming up against the offenders to punish their "crimes" (and protect their own skins). As a result, attacks on the castles of noble families rarely leave <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather">any survivors</a>.

</li><li> The drow princess Liriel Baenre discusses this system (and drow society in general) with a couple of curious surface dwellers in the novel <em>Windwalker</em>. She uses the example of a renowned master swordsmith and an up-and-coming rival, and notes that there are two accepted ways for the younger smith to get the older one's position — he can genuinely dedicate himself to becoming more skilled (which usually takes years of effort, planning, and more than a little magic) or he can kill the other smith (which <em>also</em> usually takes years of effort, planning, and more than a little magic). Liriel notes that although the stereotypical image of drow is that they would prefer the second way, in actual practice that's not always the case.

<div class="indent">Klingon warriors fight (for practice) all the time in all manner of duels and other contests. All warriors, Klingons or otherwise, are a very competitive group constantly on watch for any weakness in their enemies or rivals. But it would be foolish for any professional military force to operate this way. You might see the best engineer in a generation die in a meaningless duel in the Academy just because someone with half of his IQ had twice his cunning. Officers with two decades of combat experience might be killed by junior ensigns half of their age who have no clue how to run a starship or command a battalion.
</div></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarFleetBattles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarFleetBattles">Star Fleet Universe</a> fiction story <em>Mutiny on the Demonslayer</em>, Commodore Jark Valgan attempts to assassinate his superior, Admiral Korvik, so as to take his position.

In the Third Imperium's history, there was a period where naval admirals would kill the current Emperor and take the title themselves. They were called the "Emperors of the Flag". In 2nd Edition <em>MegaTraveller</em>, Archduke Dulinor assassinated Emperor Strephon and tried to take his place, but failed.
<ul><li> The "Right of Assassination" was established centuries earlier after Porfiria, chosen by lot by a secret meeting of the Imperial Moot, assassinated and succeeded Cleon III, who was the Third Imperium's equivalent to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">Caligula</a>. However, ascension by assassination still required the approval of the Moot, which the Flag Emperors and Dulinor did not have.

<ul><li> The Skaven, and how! The entire race is built around the concept of backstabbing = good, and they follow it with gusto. There's probably not a single Skaven who is not planning to off his superior/tormentor/brother. Higher up in the ranks you have to get creative, as demonstrated when Grey Seer Thanquol of <em>Gotrek and Felix</em> fame offed his competitor for the position of army general with an accident involving a loaded crossbow and an exploding donkey.
</li><li> Pretty much the way the Greenskin army hierarchy works — if you want to be the Warlord, you need to kill the old Warlord. Ogres follow a similar style of leadership, with the added expectation that the winner eats the loser alive to cement his claim.
</li><li> Attempted by Malekith, would-be third Phoenix King of the High Elves, when he poisoned his predecessor and killed the council of princes that selected the king. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">Long story short it didn't work</a>, which is why Malekith is currently more well-known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">the Witch King of the Dark Elves</a>. The Dark Elves, incidentally, also use this trope heavily, all the way up to Malekith who has kept his position of head honcho for millennia by being tougher, meaner and more vicious than his entire kingdom. Malekith also serves as something as a control mechanism on this trope: Anyone who wants to try getting a promotion needs Malekith's approval first, or they'll find themselves deposed no sooner than their superior lies dead.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ork hierarchy tends to work this way, ditto the Dark Eldar: if you succeed in killing the previous Warboss/Archite, the former officeholder clearly didn't deserve the job. This trope is so important to the orks that it's part of their actual <em>biology</em>. An ork that does well in fighting will naturally grow in size, allowing him to boss around smaller orks and challenge orks at his own size. Winning makes him even bigger and lets him boss around orks at his former size and losing will (if it doesn't kill him) make his rival bigger and capable of bossing over him; either way the hierarchy is preserved. It should be mentioned that, to orks, the notion of a smaller ork challenging — to say nothing of <em>defeating</em> — a bigger ork in a scrap for leadership is literally inconceivable (i.e. not only physically impossible but something an ork is incapable of thinking about), which explains why it's never happened.
</li><li> The Dark Eldar are a particularly stellar example as literally the <em>only</em> method of advancement is to kill the person holding the desired title. Orks may simply intimidate other Orks into servitude with their superior size and bash the skulls of anyone who disagrees, but this trope is so fundamental to Dark Eldar society that bodyguards have to be hired from outside their Cabal (the closest thing they have to an organization) because none of their subordinates are trustworthy. Incidentally, Asdrubael Vect, the leader of the most powerful Cabal, is one of the oldest and most powerful beings in the galaxy.
</li><li> Chaos, as well as some of the more psychotic loyalist chapters, have this trope as well. The Horus Heresy short story <em>Inheritor</em> reveals that this is how the titular character, Eliphas (the Chaos hero unit from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a>: Dark Crusade</em>), earned his epithet: he killed his Chapter Master during the Word Bearers' purge and took command of his Chapter. Lorgar said that Eliphas hadn't earned his new position, he had merely "inherited" it.
</li><li> This is both averted and played straight with the Moritat. The Moritat are a death cult, but it's considered taboo to kill a fellow Moritat unless you have a damn good reason. The singular exception is the leader of the cult, the High Reaper. She will take one apprentice and groom him/her as her replacement. How does (s)he gain the rank? Take a guess.

Alternatively, you can avoid this trope by being the most prestigious hero and winning by default when the king eventually dies.

<ul><li> The way the game was originally designed, during the moment where Gradenko or later Zhukov gets killed, instead they would be fighting to the death. A pistol conveniently lands in front of you. And then, you got to choose who to shoot — Stalin or Gradenko. This opens many worms since Gradenko was an Alliance defector.
</li><li> In the Soviet ending, just as Stalin celebrates victory in Buckingham Palace, the tea he drinks turns out to be poisoned by none other than Nadia, with his science advisor Kane (yes, Kane) as an accomplice. After a brief struggle, Stalin's last words call Nadia a bitch. Nadia responds by shooting Stalin multiple times. Long story short, you get told you are being promoted to premier. Nadia subtly insults you by explaining that the Brotherhood of Nod will require you to keep things in Russia running while they call the shots and make their preparations, which should take until the 90's when Russia will become expendable. Cue Kane shooting Nadia in the back. Kane considers shooting you as well, but decides that you're worthy of the title <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil">Comrade Chairman</a> as long as <em>he</em> is the <em>future</em>.

Their god, the Daedric Prince Malacath, sees this as a good thing; in order to protect themselves, the orcs have to prove that their leader is strong enough to protect them all. Chief Yamarz of Largashbur is implied to be the source of the stronghold's curse as he uses his cunning to weasel his way out of problems instead of facing them head-on, leading to the local giants to attack the stronghold. He tries to kill the Dragonborn after they fight their way to Volendrung, Malacath's hammer, proving he was never worthy to be chieftain in Malacath's eyes.

The first time we see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah">Seymour</a>, he has just taken over his late father Jyscal's position of Maester (roughly equivalent to some sort of sub-Pope) in the Church of Yevon. At that time in the game this can seem a bit odd since at that point Yevon is apparently a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaintlyChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaintlyChurch">Saintly Church</a> dedicated to stopping <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounter">fiends</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Sin</a>, while having the son take his father's place smacks of nepotism. Because Seymour is established as having already been a high-level church official, however, a player can gloss over this without suspecting the true corruption at the heart of Yevon. Several hours later in the game, it is revealed that Seymour killed his father discreetly in order to get said position, cementing his status as a viable villain and adding to a strong impression that the Church of Yevon is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch">Corrupt Church</a>. (It was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">Operation Mi'ihen</a> that started said impression.) Some time yet later in the game (it varies, depending on how much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a> the player had to do to defeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Evrae</a>), it is revealed that not only did Seymour kill his father for his position, but that all but one of his peers, (<em>including the Pope-equivalent and de facto ruler of the world</em>), were aware of his actions and condoned them as a way for Seymour to become a Maester, thus proving that it really is Klingon Promotion at its finest.
</li><li> The backstory of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em> states that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod">Mad God</a> Anankos took over the Kingdom of Valla by killing its true sovereign <em>and</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel">his once</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend">Only Friend</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing">its unnamed King</a>.

</li><li> Though military promotions for the Elites are based solely on how many <em>enemies</em> they've killed, political promotions work similarly to the Brute system, as shown in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloTheColeProtocol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloTheColeProtocol">Halo: The Cole Protocol</a></em>, where a newly-ascended <em>kaidon</em> (feudal lord) easily kills three assassins sent against him. He then appears before his keep's elders and proceeds to execute the elder who sent the assassins, which is their version of a vote of no-confidence. Why? Because the elder didn't challenge him openly. The only reason he didn't slaughter the elder's entire family but had them exiled instead, was because the elder fought back at the last second, showing he had some honor left. Fittingly enough, the <em>kaidon</em> we've been talking about just happens be Thel 'Vadam, better known as the Arbiter introduced in <em>Halo 2</em>.

Shayera confesses to her romantic rival Vixen that she is unsure of Earth ways of rivalry; "It's not like I can poison your water or something. *sigh* I miss Thanagar." As Vixen leaves after their workout, Shayera casually tosses her a water bottle. Vixen pauses for a moment, claims she's not worried, then disposes of it.

Basically, Luthor admits he was planning on biding his time before taking over, but Grodd's plan is so stupid, he might as well do it now, and does.

Stumpy tries to formulate a complex plan to kill Mr. cat so he can become the boss instead, though he never gets the chance to carry it out.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ShadowRaiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ShadowRaiders">Shadow Raiders</a></em>, that's the policy for the rulership of planet Bone. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">although we discover near the series' end that Femur couldn't entirely stomach killing his brother, the king at the time, and merely imprisoned him on the Prison Planet in order to take the throne.</span>

Palpatine is forced to step in personally to cut the numbers back down to manageable levels <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by killing Opress</span>, and Ventress goes into hiding.
</li><li> In nearly twenty-five years of being in various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> series, Starscream accomplished this exactly once in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformersTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformersTheMovie">The Transformers: The Movie</a></em> by declaring himself leader of the Decepticons after having a severely damaged Megatron dumped into space alongside other defeated Decepticons. And mere hours later <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Galvatron (a reformatted Megatron) came back to do the same thing to him.</span>
<ul><li> This is, essentially, how the Decepticons work. The same for the descendants, the Predacons. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> Megatron even points out after an attempted assassination by Tarantulas that he's ok with treachery. It's <em>incompetence</em> he hates.
<ul><li> When Rhinox is infected with a virus that turns him into a Predacon, he immediately starts plotting against Megatron... and nearly succeeds. Rhinox is really smart. Trying to make him ruthless is probably not a good idea. And then Megatron goes and does it <em>again</em>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder16" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
Naturally, this can happen in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, even in our <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">so-called enlightened modern era</a>, but it's generally more of a historical phenomenon.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>: The kingdom of Assyria decided its inheritance of the throne by just having a civil war, where the princes were invited to attack each other and the last one standing would become the new king.
</li><li> This was par for the course in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire">The Roman Empire</a>:
<ul><li> Relatively few Roman emperors would be succeeded by their children, at least in part because of this phenomenon. Often, it was considered politically expedient to do this, because the Emperor's children were crazy or incompetent. In fact, Imperial succession was technically <em>not</em> hereditary and involved the Emperor appointing his eventual successor — sometimes it worked (<em>e.g.</em> the era of the "Five Good Emperors"), but often it didn't (because the Emperor would appoint his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism">crazy or incompetent offspring</a> as his heir). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard">Praetorian Guard</a> kick-started the trend when they killed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Caligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Caligula">Caligula</a> and all his possible successors other than Claudius to ensure he would be Emperor. However, you also had a lot of competing interests — there could be as many as six different claimants to the throne at any one time, and there were some years where more than one emperor was overthrown in succession — 69 AD saw four emperors, 193 AD saw five, 238 AD saw six, and there were 25 different emperors between 235 and 284.
</li><li> Republican Rome had a variant — if you successfully prosecuted a Roman Senator in court, you obtained their rank. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Cicero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Cicero">Cicero</a> in particular advanced his political career this way, making a habit of suing people who were higher in rank and destroying them in court.
</li><li> The <em>rex Nemorensis</em> was the chief priest of the goddess Diana at a shrine near Lake Nemi. At least according to legend, this priest had to be an escaped slave, and obtained the position by killing the prior priest in ritual combat. They would hold the position only as long as they could defeat all new claimants. If this method of selection wasn't entirely apocryphal, it had ceased by the early Empire.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire">Byzantine Empire</a> was happy to continue this tradition, with its vague system of succession meaning that it was common to become Emperor by killing or deposing the previous one. One notable example is Basil I, a peasant who was good with horses and invited to the court by horse-racing fan Emperor Michael III (<em>a.k.a.</em> "Michael the Drunken") — he convinced Michael to depose his co-emperor Bardas (claiming Bardas wanted the throne for himself), then murdered Michael and became Emperor outright, beginning the Macedonian dynasty.
</li></ul></li><li> The Visigoths had 35 kings between 395 and 720 AD, eleven of whom were murdered by their successors. The Visigoths had an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectiveMonarchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectiveMonarchy">Elective Monarchy</a>, but Gothic law also said that a new king should be elected immediately after the previous one dies, in the same location as his death — and who could be closer to the dead king than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">guy who killed him</a>?
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AkechiMitsuhide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AkechiMitsuhide">Akechi Mitsuhide</a> is often accused of having tried to do this in assassinating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga">Oda Nobunaga</a> in the Honnō-ji Incident in 1582. Historians differ as to whether he had this in mind during the assassination (some claim he did it to prove his loyalty to the Emperor and prevent Nobunaga from flouting his authority), but he definitely did try to consolidate power as the Shogun. He lasted eleven days before he was himself deposed and killed by the forces of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ToyotomiHideyoshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ToyotomiHideyoshi">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a>.
</li><li> Crown Prince Dipendra of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nepal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nepal">Nepal</a> <em>kind of</em> did this in 2001 when he became the perpetrator of what became known as the Nepal Royal Massacre. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan">murdered the King and Queen</a> and several other relatives. This made him King — except he then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderSuicide">shot himself in the head</a>. He was declared King of Nepal while he lay in a coma in hospital, then died after a three-day "reign". This led to the reign of Dipendra's uncle Gyanendra, who was not expecting to be King and botched the job so badly (adopting a particularly authoritarian style) that a non-violent revolution led to the abolition of the monarchy entirely and the establishment of a republic.
</li><li> During the Middle Ages, the Abbasid Caliphate saw this happen routinely. At least one caliph ruled for only a day before being assassinated. Rulers eventually started a tradition of sending their sons into exile to cut down on the random dethronings.
</li><li> The Ottoman Empire tried to prevent this for a while when the sultans would imprison their heirs in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuxuryPrisonSuite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuxuryPrisonSuite">Luxury Prison Suite</a> in Kafes (literally "the Golden Cage"). These future sultans, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CabinFever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CabinFever">would grow up in the confines of the Cage</a> and often turn out even crazier (and stabbier) than their predecessors.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMexicanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMexicanRevolution">The Mexican Revolution</a>, one day (19 February 1913) saw three people being President. Francisco Madero started the day as President. However, Madero had already been taken prisoner by the forces of General Victoriano Huerta, along with several members of his cabinet. One of the cabinet members, Foreign Minister Pedro Lascuráin, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnOfferYouCantRefuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnOfferYouCantRefuse">convinced</a> by Huerta's men to talk Madero and the vice president (José María Pino Suárez) into resigning, with promises that Huerta would spare them and guarantee their safe passage to exile if they did so. Madero and Pino Suárez agreed (seeing little other choice), leaving Lascuráin next in line and therefore president. He was president for just long enough to appoint Huerta Minister of the Interior—next in line after Foreign Minister—before he resigned himself (by some accounts, after only 15 minutes as President, though some give him a whole hour in office), giving Huerta the presidency. What turns it into this trope is that Huerta, for his part, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILied">had Madero and Pino Suárez killed three days later</a> on the way to their ship. (This act is widely believed to have doomed Huerta's regime by making Madero a martyr to democracy and a useful rallying point for opponents of Huerta, rather than the somewhat divisive and kind of disappointing figure he had been during his actual presidency.)
</li><li> Dingane, the half-brother of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ShakaZulu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ShakaZulu">Shaka Zulu</a>, became the second king of the Zulu Empire after conspiring with another half-brother (Mhlangano) and a member of a rival tribe (Mbopa of the InDuna) to murder Shaka in 1828. Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">he murdered Mhlangano</a>, assumed the throne, and ordered all of Shaka's supporters and his royal kin executed.
</li><li> The "Five Dravidians" refer to a succession of five Tamil kings who ruled parts of southern India and Sri Lanka around the beginning of the first century BCE — and all five took power in this way. King Valagamba was ousted (although not killed) and replaced by Pulahatta; who was killed and replaced by his Chief Minister, Bahiya; who was killed and replaced by his Prime Minister, Panya Mara; who was killed and replaced (after lasting eight years — he was the only one to last more than three) by his Chief Minister, Pilaya Mara; who was killed and replaced by his Chief Minister, Dathika; who was killed and replaced by Valagamba, who took back his throne.
</li><li> There are a few interesting traditions that arose out of attempts to preempt a possible Klingon Promotion:
<ul><li> The Medieval French slogan "The King is dead; long live the King" evokes an immediate transfer of power from one King to another, implying that a legitimate successor has always been in the works. The tradition migrated to Britain, where the modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishPoliticalSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishPoliticalSystem">Parliament</a> officially ratifies the monarch's successor (through the Act of Settlement 1701 and subsequent amendments; they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar">fought a war</a> to get there).
</li><li> The British Army instituted rules against duelling other officers in the 17th century, as a way of preventing them from challenging senior officers to duels on trumped-up matters of honour, then moving up in rank after they win.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem">American Political System</a> doesn't allow this (despite some of the nation's students <a class="urllink" href="http://shitmystudentswrite.tumblr.com/post/70931460211/sic-semper-tyrannis">believing otherwise<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), mostly through the operation of the Constitution, but partly by tradition. The one time this <em>could</em> have happened was during the Watergate scandal, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a>'s vice president Spiro Agnew resigned (for unrelated offenses), meaning the next in line to be president was Speaker of the House Carl Albert — a Democrat. In theory, Albert could have called for Nixon's impeachment, blocked any vote to confirm a new Vice President, and if Nixon was thus ousted, become President himself despite being from an opposition party. Albert refused to do so, finding such a maneuver inherently undemocratic (and also believing that Nixon could beat impeachment, at least at that time) — he instead moved quickly to have Republican <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeraldFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeraldFord">Gerald Ford</a> become Vice President. Albert would later claim that if he couldn't do that before Nixon resigned, he would have appointed a Republican Vice President and immediately resigned himself.
<ul><li> It <em>could</em> happen, though, theoretically; if a vice-president were to murder the president and keep people from finding out they did it, they would be the president.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the animal kingdom, animals who practise polygamous breeding habits like lions, elephant seals, or elk have this. A male controls a territory and has breeding access to all the females in it. A new male comes in and fights for the territory: if he wins, he now controls the territory and can breed with all the females. Such fights aren't always to the death, but it's not uncommon and even if it isn't immediate, injuries inflicted in the fight combined with being forced out of what's usually prime territory can result in the loser's death.
