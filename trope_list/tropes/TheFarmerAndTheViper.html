She is then told a ghost story about a woman in black who asks for transport, then spirits her gondolier away. That night, the woman in black asks Akari for a ride to a graveyard. Akari takes her (This is notably not the only example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a>, because the anime consistently encourages naivety). Akari goes on her way, but the woman, in a weird subversion, grabs her hand and tries to spirit her away, specifically <em>because</em> she was impressed with Akari's kindness. The anime implies this to be a bad thing but never makes it really clear. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cait Sith saves her, though, so we never find out.</span>

How does Lilith repay such a kind act? By immediately plotting to force Momo to make more. Unfortunately for her, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotDumb">Momo was clever enough to put in a back-door.</a>

Raditz begs Goku for mercy, promising to leave Earth if Goku does so; over Piccolo's protests, Goku grants Raditz's mercy... and Raditz promptly knocks Goku down and ruthlessly breaks his ribs, all while rubbing in his face how stupid it was of him to fall for it. When Gohan critically injures Raditz and Goku has him restrained so Piccolo can finish him off, Raditz tries the same trick again; unfortunately for him, Goku isn't dumb enough to fall for the same ploy twice.

</li><li> Don Krieg and his crew were starving after their fleet was destroyed by Dracule Mihawk. Sanji fed them over everyone else's protests. Don Krieg "thanked" him by attacking him the moment he felt satiated and declared his intent to claim the floating restaurant as his new flagship. Sanji likely knew this would be the outcome, but having nearly starved to death once himself, wouldn't wish such a fate on <em>anyone</em>.
</li><li> In the Fishman Island arc, Robin references this trope; when Jimbei asks her to free the slaves Hammond is using for his Slave Tank, Robin is disgusted by what Hammond is doing, but expresses concern that the freed slaves will attack both her allies and enemies, hating Fishman Island after what they've been through. Jimbei says that they can simply fight them off if this happens and that he can't stand <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Hody's men acting like the Celestial Dragons</a> any longer, persuading Robin to free the slaves, who help the Straw Hats against the New Fishman Pirates.
</li><li> Still in the Fishman Island arc, a flashback gives us a variation, in that kindness isn't repaid with <em>evil</em>, but still with unkindness. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After the pirate Fisher Tiger brought the little ex-slave girl Koala back to her home, he was ambushed by Marine soldiers, who knew he would be coming. The reason being that Koala's hometown sold Tiger out to the Marines, in exchange for not taking Koala back to the nobles who enslaved her (though the latter didn't know about it); a decision possibly made easier by the fact that Tiger was a fishman. Sure, it's not kind of them to do that, but considering their reasons, it can't be called "evil", and it's pretty hard to blame them.</span>

He slaughters them and takes all their money purely because he was jealous of how happy they were. However, since Enishi wasn't irredeemable nor did he simply see the family as mere pawns to be used (normally the viper is the viper because they have no feelings for anyone and Enishi did it because of his jealousy not because it's a defining character trait), the trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">downplayed.</a>
</li><li> Subverted in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiPizzaCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiPizzaCats">Samurai Pizza Cats</a></em>. Bad Bird is about to fall off a cliff, and Speedy grabs him by the arm just before he falls. Bad Bird asks why he's helping him since he's an enemy. Speedy realizes he's right and lets him fall.

Said boy is the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGreyMorality">protagonist</a></em>.
</li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GoblinSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GoblinSlayer">Goblin Slayer</a></em>; because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGoblinsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGoblinsAreDifferent">this world's goblins</a> are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">absolutely incapable of moral behavior</a>, but possessed of enough base cunning to lie and feign otherwise, this invariably happens if someone is foolish enough to show a goblin mercy. These goblins become "Wanderers", roaming the land and migrating from nest to nest, teaching other goblins the various tactics that they saw used against themselves or their first nest — whilst many of them starve to death, those that survive make other goblin nests more dangerous, and often mature into more powerful forms themselves. This is <em>especially</em> true of goblin infants, who are seemingly born with the awareness of this tactic ingrained in them. Oh, and a Wanderer will <em>always</em> try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISurrenderSuckers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISurrenderSuckers">strike back at the person who showed them mercy the moment their guard is down</a>, if they can. Our first exposure to a Goblin Lord is one who <em>immediately</em> attacked and murdered the adventurer that spared his life, and kept on doing just that, preying on the noble sentiments of adventurers. This is one of the reasons why the titular protagonist adheres to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a> philosophy; he knows that goblins cannot be redeemed.

In the afterlife, even the gods refuse to heed his side of the story, save the god of Life who is <em>literally ripped apart before his eyes</em>, and when he finds himself being judged by the god of death, even death mocks him as an unrepentant liar and, unable to banish him to oblivion, shoves his consciousness into a virus to force him to atone for unleashing plagues, the charge of which he's falsely convicted.

On an expedition to the Yeerk homeworld, the Andalite Prince Seerow felt sorry for the Yeerks, who were fully sentient, but limited by the need for their hosts and Kandrona rays.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SummerKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SummerKnight">Summer Knight</a></em> the protagonist gets himself beholden to Queen Mab, the wicked ruler of the Winter Court of the Fae, and they agree to settle his debt by him performing three tasks for her, albeit while retaining the right to veto any one task on principle. After Mab gives him his first assignment and turns to leave, Harry incredulously asks her what makes her believe he will accept it and she tells him the story of the "Fox and Scorpion" and assures him "You will accept this case, wizard. It is what you are. It is your nature." By the end of the book, she's proved completely correct; in the process of fulfilling his task, he discovers a much larger plot, one that any rational person would admit it's <em>way</em> above his weight class for him to get involved, but Harry — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">being</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">Harry</a> — couldn't help himself but go beyond what he was obligated to do and try to save the day.

</li><li> The villain Achilles from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersShadow">Ender's Shadow</a></em> series has a pathological need to kill anyone who has ever seen him helpless — including but not limited to a girl who lifted him from low-ranking thug to leader of a prosperous gang, a nun who got him off the streets entirely and enrolled him in a good school, and a doctor who dared use anesthesia to help fix his bad leg.
</li><li> An interesting inversion takes place in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheExecutioner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheExecutioner">The Executioner</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a> Mack Bolan sets off on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> when his family dies in a murder/suicide indirectly caused by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllDevouringBlackHoleLoanSharks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllDevouringBlackHoleLoanSharks">Mafia loan sharks</a>. A faction of the New York Mafia Commission, pointing out that their own organisation was created when former enemies made peace, suggest offering Bolan a deal in which he would now work for them. A rival faction is opposed, with one mob boss who's missing several fingers mentioning a pet alligator he tried to raise as an allegory. Although an undercover Fed urges Bolan to take the deal he rejects it, saying he can't let the Mafia even <em>think</em> that they've won.

</li><li> If any lesson is to be taken from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Otherland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Otherland">Otherland</a></em>, it's this: never date anyone whose last name is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Dread</a>. And who likes to be addressed as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingArthur">More Dread</a>." And whose idea of romancing you is setting a priest on fire for your amusement ...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables">Les Misérables</a></em>:
<ul><li> Jean Valjean is taken in by the priest when no one else will after being paroled following nineteen terrible years in prison. Valjean assaults the priest and steals his silver in the night, but while escaping, he is caught by the police as a suspicious character. The priest tells the police that he gave Valjean the silver, and lets him go. This second act of kindness actually <em>changes</em> Valjean's nature, as he strives to be good in return for this following act of compassion. It's shown that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HadToComeToPrisonToBeACrook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HadToComeToPrisonToBeACrook">being put in prison had thoroughly corrupted him in the first place</a>. His crime was stealing bread to feed his sister's children, for which he got five years, with the sentence extended for every time he escaped.
</li><li> This trope is ultimately the reason Javert chooses to commit suicide. Valjean is a wanted criminal, so legally the only thing to do would be arresting him (something which Valjean has promised, by that point, not to fight). Thing is, Valjean also just saved Javert's life at the barricades, so Javert cannot, in good conscience, betray him like that. The only solution Javier can think of is to remove himself from the problem by killing himself.
</li></ul></li><li> Aristophanes quotes Aeschylus in <em>The Frogs</em> as saying: "Best not to rear a lion's cub in the City, but if you do, its ways must then be served."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall">Redwall</a></em>:
<ul><li> Veil Sixclaw repaid the Abbeydwellers for saving him by attempting to poison one of them. Then again, they may have saved his life but even before he attempted to kill them they always treated him as if he was going to anyway. His foster-mother Bryony, the only one who trusted him, considered this as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a>, but it didn't help. Worse yet, even at the end of the book <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and his life</span>, he himself feels like he is evil or just born bad, even though he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">saved Bryony, sacrificing himself to do that</a>. It's also notable for being one of the few books where Redwallians are portrayed in a less-than-sterling light. They're good in themselves here, but their actions toward Veil are ambiguous at best, just as he is ambiguously good or evil. Bryony also seems very uncertain about him even afterward, and both seem to think she should have let him go long before.
</li><li> This trope also applies to Chickenhound of <em>Redwall</em>, who is kindly taken in by the Abbeydwellers after they find him lying muddy, bloody, and unconscious in the middle of the road. He repays the gesture by stealing a bunch of random trinkets and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killing Methuselah</span>, although in his defense the latter was mostly an accident. About the only thing he <em>does</em> do that's him being nice to the Redwallers is tell them about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cluny's plans to tunnel into the Abbey</span>, which turns out to be incredibly useful, but wasn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">entirely altruistic on his part</a>.

The captain ends up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killing Mother Mellus</span> and stealing a trophy cup, but the trope is inverted when the minion ends up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">killing ''him''</a> and returning the cup to the Redwallers, whereupon he becomes a good friend of theirs and is allowed back to the Abbey for visits.</span>

Nakor tells him the "scorpion and the frog" version of the story and explains that he won't have to break his oath to Kaspar, because it's in Kaspar's nature to betray him first, which would render Tal's oath void. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sure enough, Kaspar turns on Tal and sends him to rot in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz">The Alcatraz</a>, leaving him free to enact his revenge.</span>

When Mary Ann was released, she told the others that he told her he planned to do the same to the other four, and then <em>start over again</em>, so the Professor set a trap for the criminal, and it worked. As the castaways held the criminal in a makeshift cell while the Professor worked on his ship, Ginger felt sorry for him and asked if she could speak to him, remembering how she once acted in a movie about how a psychiatrist helped a criminal reform. Eventually, the others consented (except the Professor, who had his doubts) and Ginger's amateur therapy seemed to work; for a while, he seemed remorseful and willing to help.

</li><li> Al Wilson's "The Snake" is a variation of the trope-naming story set to music. A "tender-hearted woman" finds a "poor half-frozen snake", and takes it home with her and warms it up, but is bitten in much the manner of the farmer.
<div class="indent"><em>"I saved you," cried the woman, "and you bit me, but why?</em> <br/><em>You know your bite is poisonous and now I'm gonna die."</em> <br/><em>"Oh, shut up, silly woman," said the reptile with a grin,</em> <br/><em>"You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in." </em>

The lyrics apparently come from a fable from El Libro de Buen Amor (The Good Book of Love) by Juan Ruiz, Archpriest of Hita from the 14th century AD/CE.
</li><li> In ASP's "Die kleine Ballade vom schwarzen Schmetterling", the Black Butterfly twice says "Kann nichts dafür, ich bin doch nur ein wildes Tier" (It's not my fault, I'm just a wild animal) in order to excuse torturing (and maybe killing) the protagonist.

Douglas won his match, and what was believed to be Rude's voice came over the sound system, saying that he'd take his mask off, but Douglas has to "give up the girl" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Francine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Francine">Francine</a>) or he'd give Douglas "the ass-kicking of a lifetime."

Then, one of Douglas' riot guards took off his helmet, revealing <em>himself</em> to be Rick Rude.

Naturally, Croc claims Batman is evil to get their help in capturing him. Then Croc captures everyone and plans to kill them and run off with their retirement money.

<ul><li> In "The Old Man and the Lisa", Lisa makes it her goal to help Burns rebuild his lost fortune in a socially responsible way. He takes to her teachings with zeal but in his efforts to follow her instructions he creates a recycling plant that strip mines ocean life into an all-purpose slurry. It ends with the memorable scene of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GranolaGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GranolaGirl">Lisa</a> running house to house begging people <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">not</a></em> to recycle!
</li><li> It then happens again, many seasons down the road, when Burns is brain-damaged and has lost his memory. Most of the Springfieldians take advantage of this to get revenge on him for everything he did to them. Lisa takes pity on him and ends up restoring him to his former, evil self, with the added lesson that hatred is the only thing keeping him alive.
</li><li> "Pokey Mom" has Marge take an interest in reforming Jack Crowley, a prisoner convicted of armed robbery (voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelKeaton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelKeaton">Michael Keaton</a>) by encouraging his casual interest in art. The warden agrees to let Marge take Jack into her home and help him find a job as a mural painter. When Marge hears that Principal Skinner wants a mural painted for Springfield Elementary, she suggests Jack for the task. But Skinner forces him to paint a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeDiabetes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeDiabetes">treacly, cutesy scene</a> instead of what he actually wanted to paint - and then, to add insult to injury, Skinner has Jack take all the blame when the mural proves unpopular. Jack has to be restrained from physically assaulting the principal, and soon afterward the mural is burned down. Marge finds Jack hiding in the playground and accuses him of going back to a life of crime; Jack lies that he's innocent, prompting Marge to believe him and to help him escape. Marge's reward for this is seeing Jack pour gasoline on Skinner's car and light <em>that</em> on fire in full view of everyone, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughingMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughingMad">laughing diabolically</a>.

</li><li> In "Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily", Homer and Marge lose custody of the kids, who are adopted by the Flanders. They show Rod and Todd an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon where Scratchy adopts Itchy only to be killed. The dying Scratchy asks Itchy "Why?"

In the beginning, he does do good and helps save the kids and trucker, but as more of his memories return he reverts to his evil persona. In "gratitude" for helping him, he tries to kidnap the kids and leave the volcanic island their parents are researching. When one of the children tries to appeal to goodness, he replies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatManIsDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatManIsDead">"Steel Man? Steel Man is dead!</a> And so are you, Superman!" Lois Lane later consoles the children with "He <em>was</em> good, when he was with you.

Being the greedy prick he is, Pete reveals he only pretended to be freezing to death as he and his cousin take over Mickey's cabin. Of course, being a cartoon about Disney's beloved mascot, Mickey not only managed to turn the two against each other but, in the end, tricked the criminal dimwits into turning themselves into the police.

</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>, Lois finds out she has a brother (voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertDowneyJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertDowneyJr">Robert Downey Jr.</a>) who was put in a sanitarium by her parents after a traumatic event and kept a family secret. Lois, assuming her awful parents were just being awful again, brings her brother home to live with her. It turns out he's a dangerous psychotic who kills fat people. He goes on a killing spree that ends with him trying to kill Peter.
<ul><li> This was also the point of the episode where Peter befriends OJ Simpson. The Griffins come to the conclusion the OJ is really an O.K. guy who deserves the benefit of the doubt, only for him to stab a woman in plain view of everyone and go running off on a mad killing spree.

We're led to believe this involves provoking Gilda with party pranks until she loses her temper and Rainbow can see how bad she is, but it turns out Rainbow herself set up the pranks and it was only chance that Gilda ran into all of them; Pinkie's plan was simply to throw a party for her in the hopes that it would get her to lighten up. Needless to say, it fails miserably, but at least Rainbow does learn Gilda's true nature and kicks her to the curb. Four seasons later, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it ends up subverted when Gilda reappears and gets her redemption</span>.

At first, Azrael seems grateful, but upon hearing his master Gargamel calling out for him, he reverts back to his own evil nature and is almost ready to tear Nat Smurf to shreds when he gets chased off into the forest by a larger creature. Nat Smurf mistakes this situation for an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroclesLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroclesLion">Androcles' Lion</a>.

</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EvilConCarne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EvilConCarne">Evil Con Carne</a></em>, the title character and Cod Commando are marooned together on an island, and Hector successfully uses this trick on Cod <em>three times in the same episode.</em> (The fourth time he tries it when success is vital to escaping, Cod wises up, and leaves him behind.)
</li><li> Early on in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen">X-Men</a></em>, when Sabretooth winds on at the X-Mansion's doorstep, Professor Xavier takes him in and attempts to help him overcome his bestial urges, with Wolverine being the only objector. It goes about as well as you can expect: when Jubilee attempts to help him out with his hospital restraints so they won't be too uncomfortable, Sabretooth breaks loose and attacks her, forcing Wolvie to fight him off, which also results in him getting injured in the process.
<ul><li> Fully subverted in another episode with Juggernaut with a similar premise, so it ends up being more akin to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroclesLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroclesLion">Androcles' Lion</a>. The X-Men help Juggernaut as he's convalescent, and when he wakes up Wolverine gets ready for a fight. Instead, Juggernaut leaves, saying he doesn't feel like it today.

During Po's imprisoning, the kids attempt to justify this by explaining that they have no other option besides this, due to being held captive by their thieving leader. Po offers to break them out of their situation, and leads them back to the Jade Palace, where they appear to be settling in just fine...that is until they trick Po <em>again</em>, by imprisoning him in the Palace's dungeon so that the leader thief can steal a precious ruby. It isn't until Po points out they cannot split a single ruby between each other for profit, that the kids turn on their leader once again, now having completed the aversion of the trope.

</li><li> The episode "Bubbled" has Steven floating in space with a Ruby Soldier he calls Eyeball. After her gem gets cracked—which can be fatal—Steven pulls Eyeball into his protective bubble and uses his powers to fix her gem. Using that healing power makes Eyeball realize Steven really <em>does</em> have Rose Quartz's gem, as he'd been trying to tell her, so Eyeball pulls a knife and tries to carve Steven's gem out so she can be a hero for capturing Rose Quartz.
</li><li> In the episode "Room for Ruby", the character <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Navy</span> crashed in front of Steven's house from space, begging for forgiveness and asking to join the Crystal Gems, claiming the other <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Rubies</span> were mean to her.
