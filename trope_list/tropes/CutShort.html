<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ActAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ActAge">Act-age</a></em> was cancelled overnight at 123 chapters in the middle of a non-concluded arc (and with a stage play and an anime adaptation underway) when its writer Matsuki Tatsuya was arrested for sexual misconduct. To make it more painful, the artist Usazaki Shiro promptly removed any mention of the series −the one that brought her success− from her Twitter account, making it very unlikely that it will ever resume.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a></em>: As with adaptations of Rumiko Takahashi's manga, the length of the manga made it all but impossible to fully adapt into an anime. This may change with the manga's conclusion in 2014.
</li><li> The anime version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiYoriAoshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiYoriAoshi">Ai Yori Aoshi</a></em> ended at volume 12 or so of the manga, leaving the "Kaoru and Aoi" plot thread unresolved. (The manga ran for 17 volumes and did have a proper ending.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em>, its anime first episode is a huge indication of that, apparently the unknown blond girl sliced Isaac's ear off for no reason; her name is Adele by the way and she is a major character further where the anime left off. It seems Brain Base didn't expect this much of a flop; the series had to be cut short.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Barrage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Barrage">Barrage</a></em> ended with only 16 chapters as it was going through its first story arc. The finale sees Astro beating Mr. Black <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">the man who had inspired him to look out for others</a></span> and continuing his training to be a proper prince. Luckily, the author's next product was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">a bit</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement">more successful.</a>
</li><li> This actually happened to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beelzebub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beelzebub">Beelzebub</a></em> in both the manga and its anime adaptation.
<ul><li> For the manga, it was suddenly cancelled due to poor ratings the last several months it was being released. The final chapters was forced to rush the section of the Ishiyama Upstart arc it was on to end the fight against Fuji, and then capped the manga off with a 2-year-jump epilogue in the final chapter.
</li><li> As for the anime, it rushed through the climax of the Akuma Academy arc to create a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding">Gecko Ending</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> anime notoriously ends at the conclusion of "Band of the Hawks", a very long flashback that explains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowWeGotHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowWeGotHere">How We Got Here</a> for the first few episodes. Not only does this leave the series with a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftHanging">it isn't clear how they'd get out</a> (even though you <em>know</em> they do because of the opening episodes), <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because the Skull Knight - who rescues Guts and Casca in the manga - isn't in the anime</span>. It's interesting to note that the anime series did not end abruptly because of cancellation or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">Author Existence Failure</a> - it just... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding">ended.</a>
<ul><li> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelGap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelGap">18 years</a> of retreading the same material that the 90s anime covered, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Berserk2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Berserk2016">sequel series</a> that finally continues the story beyond the "Band of the Hawk" arc finally premiered in summer 2016.
</li></ul></li><li> Atsuhi Ohkubo's first manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BIchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BIchi">B.Ichi</a></em> has an intense build-up to the final confrontation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadFriend">Big Bad Friend</a> Emine starts the Gathering of the Masks, the protagonist Showtaro has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeALevelInBadass">taken a level in badass</a> and is ready to jump in, determined to save his friend and a big END is splashed at the bottom of the page. The series ends abruptly just before the final arc, with several questions unresolved and others only vaguely answered. It's safe to assume that it wasn't meant to end this way.
</li><li> Depending on who you ask, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO">The Big O</a></em> qualifies. Some will argue that they tried to wrap it up when they discovered they wouldn't get a third season, others believe they left the end of season two as is in the hopes of getting a season three.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>
<ul><li> The anime regularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga">Overtook the Manga</a> prompting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler arcs</a> lasting up to a full year. When the anime caught up to the manga again at the end of the Lost Agent Arc, it was unceremoniously cancelled rather than going into filler while the Final Arc was still in publication. There was never any official word on either the reason for the cancellation or whether any plans had been made to animate the Final Arc.
</li><li> In interviews, Kubo Tite stated the Final Arc would run at least as long as the 26-volume Arrancar Arc to tie up all loose ends in the story. However, 19 volumes into the Final Arc, <em>Bleach</em> announced it would be ending, and the finale coincided with its fifteenth anniversary. Kubo had been suffering increasingly ill health since 2010, that made continuing the manga a struggle for him. Although he had known what the final chapter would be back when he began the manga, he wrapped up the story much faster than he had originally planned. The extremely rushed conclusion left many questions, and didn't even resolve the fates of many key characters.
</li></ul></li><li> The anime version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoboboboBobobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoboboboBobobo">Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo</a></em> ended so abruptly, even the characters were shell-shocked, the show was pretty popular despite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> in Japan finding it controversial, but the reason the show ended early was due to one of its sponsors being in a financial crisis at the time.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis">Bubblegum Crisis</a></em> OVA is rather infamous for this. It got to episode 8, which was a big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> moment for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayfulHacker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayfulHacker">Nene Romanova</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidseasonUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidseasonUpgrade">Midseason Upgrade</a> for everyone, and then... a combination of internal politics and budget issues caused a schism between the two companies that produced the show, ending production abruptly before the remaining planned 5 episodes could be completed. <em>Bubblegum Crash!</em> tried sometime later to tie things up, but didn't have everyone on board, and the result was... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">not well-received by fans</a>.
</li></ul><ul><li> Poor <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CuteyHoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CuteyHoney">Cutey Honey</a></em> has had this happen to her plenty of times over the years.
<ul><li> The original 1973 anime series got cancelled after 25 episodes due to its, at the time, racy content.
</li><li> <em>New Cutey Honey</em>, started out as a 4 episode OVA that ended up being so popular, that eight more episodes were ordered. Unfortunately, it ended up being cancelled after airing four of the eight promised episodes.
</li><li> <em>Cutie Honey a Go Go!</em> was cancelled right in the middle of the story after 10 chapters due to the series reaching the limit of an average serial manga series. Another reason was that the manga was meant to be an adaptation of the 2004 live-action movie, but the author decided halfway through to change it up and do his own thing, taking multiple elements from the original manga.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DailyLivesOfHighSchoolBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DailyLivesOfHighSchoolBoys">Daily Lives of High School Boys</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-09-27/daily-lives-of-high-school-boys-manga-abruptly-ends">abruptly ended<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in September 2012, with a final chapter that doesn't remotely look like a finale. No reason was given for this.
</li><li> The manga adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DateALive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DateALive">Date A Live</a></em> gets cut short just before Shidou's first date with Tohka, which is <em>in the middle of the first volume of the light novel</em>. However, the reason why it ends there isn't because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> or for unknown reasons, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-02-23/date-a-live-manga-ends-abruptly-due-to-artist-health">but because of the artist's health issue.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Dangaioh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Dangaioh">Dangaioh</a></em> was supposed to be longer than 3 episodes and was supposed to have a sequel, but that never happened, resulting in the OVA's ending on a cliffhanger. It later got a sequel named <em>Great Dangaioh</em> was supposed to be 26 episodes, but it was so poorly-received by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">both fans and critics</a> that the series was cut to 12 episodes and once again ended on a cliffhanger, effectively ensuring that the <em>Dangaioh</em> series as a whole would never get a proper ending, let alone resolve the OVA's events.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em>: The anime stops after Lenalee and Allen defeat the Level 4 Akuma, with Lenalee discovering the new Crystal Type Anti-Akuma Weapon. Afterwards, there's a shot of the main cast, who have survived the attack, and the Noah Clan with different appearances, indicating a time skip. The show ends with Allen and the Millennium Earl preparing for the inevitable fights ahead. The last thing we get is a cut to black with the word "FIN" covering the screen. The show was cancelled due to a combination of low ratings and the anime getting close to overtaking the manga.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DominaNoDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DominaNoDo">Domina no Do!</a></em>, where the manga just suddenly ends with no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> and nothing resolved.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DoubleArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DoubleArts">Double Arts</a></em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shonen">Shōnen</a> manga, had just finished setting up its premise, characters, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, even debuted the titular fighting style, and it was really starting to distinguish itself from its generic beginnings... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IShouldWriteABookAboutThis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IShouldWriteABookAboutThis">when the person writing the tale closed the book saying, "I may continue it... some other time."</a>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em> anime was this for a long time. By the time the initial series ended, Celty still hadn't found her head, two major characters from the light novels were introduced in the <em>very last episode</em>, and it still hadn't been revealed what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Izaya's</a> ultimate plans are. It finally got another season after 5 years which finished off the story, making this a very rare example of a light novel series that received a complete anime adaptation.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em> anime ended early due to marketing and broadcasting issues (which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn">for good reason</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RRatedOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RRatedOpening">for the anime's notoriety</a>; how can you market something like <em>that</em> to a ten to fifteen-year-old?!). Instead, the anime propels itself to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding">Gecko Ending</a>, while the manga goes for a complex <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>. However, due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit">surprising fanbase for a manga that had literally one ad for its anime</a>, there's a <em>slight</em> possibility of there being a second season, but a greater possibility for an OVA or movie-based remake.
</li><li> <em>Faeries Landing</em> started off slow and then built up to ramming speed with the plot, finally hitting important and very well put together plots and scripts, introduced a new love interest, finally had the main heroine meet her parents completely and both the main villain of the heroine and the main villain of the hero attack their respective targets and just as the hero and heroine go towards their targets for battle...... the volume ends. What makes this a problem? The author dropped the series to start on another promising to come back for it and never doing so. Effectively the series ENDS on a cliffhanger just before the resolution!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyUnlimited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyUnlimited">Final Fantasy: Unlimited</a></em> was cut short from the original 52 episodes to 24, resolving the latter parts with voiced dramas, books and a web novel that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">never see the light outside Japan</a>.
</li><li> <em>Fire Candy</em> ended with a particularly violent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger">Cliffhanger</a> after only nineteen chapters, leaving the biggest part of the plot entirely untouched.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars">Food Wars!</a></em>: After the manga reception became increasingly cold, with sales dropping after each volume and a very poor reception to the last two major story arcs of the manga, the manga was rushed to the ending, with a 3-parter epilogue special being published later that year to try to tie loose ends.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GalaxyAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GalaxyAngel">Galaxy Angel</a></em> anime parodies this. At the end of every single season, a huge cliffhanger is set up, and the next season makes absolutely no mention of it whatsoever.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gantz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gantz">Gantz</a></em>, or rather the anime version: due to the very slow updating of the source manga, only the first three arcs were adapted before a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding">confusing filler ending</a> concluded the series.
</li><li> The second series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Genshiken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Genshiken">Genshiken</a></em> stops at a point in the storyline just before the eighth manga volume begins. It had previously added to and extended the manga's material in order to have enough for a third series. The final nail in the coffin is that the Second Generation manga (volume 10 onward) has now been adapted to anime, leaving the ending of the original series likely never to be covered, outside of a the odd flashback in the new series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunBlazeWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunBlazeWest">Gun Blaze West</a></em> ended with the heroes managing to pass a test and allowed to be shown a secret way to the fabled location but never actually showing them reaching there. The final bits showing an earlier character thought killed coming upon the gun he gave to the main character who left it as sort of a bread crumb to follow him.
</li><li> This has happened to at least two separate shows in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> franchise:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> was meant for 50 episodes, but due to poor ratings the network cut them down to 39. However, the staff asked for an extension in order to wrap everything up properly, resulting in an unorthodox 42 episode run. They arguably succeeded, since the show resolved most of its plotlines well enough and didn't leave any major threads hanging.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX">After War Gundam X</a></em> was originally meant for 50 episodes, but was cut down to 39, resulting in the last arc being only 3 episodes long, and extremely rushed.
</li></ul></li><li> Happened <em>twice</em> with the 1999 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em> anime, at first immediately after a big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">reveal</a> right in the middle of an intense story arc due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga">overtaking the manga</a>. Needless to say, fans weren't pleased and as a result the animation studio released a series of OVAs that covered the rest of the arc and the one after that. Unfortunately those ended in the <em>middle of a chapter.</em> This had an even worse effect on the English dub since, for whatever reason, Viz Media <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">didn't bother</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDubForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDubForYou">dubbing the OVAs</a>.
</li><li> Ero-manga story <em>Junk Story</em>, featured in Eros Comix's <em>Silky Whip Extreme</em> ends with the heroine ?_, waiting for a rescue by a character who appears to have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>. This would just be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a> combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding">No Ending</a>, except for the fact that it <em>leaves every single plot thread unresolved</em>, and even introduces <em>new plot threads that will never be resolved.</em>
</li><li> The anime of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KareKano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KareKano">Kare Kano</a></em> got cut off after one season for several reasons, among them Studio Gainax having the usual Studio Gainax problems and, rather more importantly, the manga's author reacting <em>very</em> badly to the direction the anime took and pulling the rights.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Katekyō Hitman Reborn!</a></em> anime ended this way, right after the Future Arc when they come home, all they do is say that Tsuna needs more training before coming a boss and just stare at the sky right when the credits roll.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill">Kill la Kill</a></em> manga not only doesn't adapt the second half of the story, but is noticeably more and more rushed as it goes on. The first volume is pretty much an 1:1 adaptation, but then two whole episodes are skipped and the rest is abridged.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLastSaiyuki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLastSaiyuki">The Last Saiyuki</a></em> manga was cancelled leaving the remaining chapters to wrap things up.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina">Love Hina</a></em> anime finished its first season, began setting up a second...before getting canceled a few episodes in and with zero resolution. Eventually, a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OVA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OVA">OVAs</a> came out that tried to rush through the missing plot arcs.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftHanging">Left Hanging</a> nature of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico">Martian Successor Nadesico</a></em> was intentional. The non-ending of its movie continuation was not, since it was a planned trilogy that had its second and third installments canceled.
</li><li> Ditto <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Mx0" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Mx0">Mx0</a></em>. How the guy was able to continue illustrating after those is an incredible feat altogether.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicalRecordLyricalNanohaForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicalRecordLyricalNanohaForce">official fourth season</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a> franchise seems to have gone this way, while no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has confirmed the series cancelation, considering the fact that there has been a prolonged hiatus since September 2013 the future isn't looking so bright.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew">Mew Mew Power</a></em>, the 4Kids English dub of <em>Tokyo Mew Mew</em> was cancelled after Episode 26, never adapting episodes 27-52. What's worse, is that the dub ended with a "To Be Continued..." title card. In addition, many, many foreign dubs used this version as a reference, and many of them (such as Spanish, Greek, and Brazilian Portuguese) ended up canceled as well. Apparently it was canceled because 4Kids could not find a merchandising deal for the show.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NaruTaru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NaruTaru">Naru Taru</a></em> anime ended at about halfway through the manga's story, giving next to no closure. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">But that may be a merciful choice</a>.
</li></ul><ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NuraRiseOfTheYokaiClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NuraRiseOfTheYokaiClan">Nura: Rise of the Yokai Clan</a></em> manga wasn't doing too hot in the ratings and ended up getting canceled shortly after chapter 207 was released. However, the mangeka was given the ability to write three final monthly chapters, 208, 209 and 210, to at least give the final battle against Seimei, and the rest of the Gokadoin household, some form of a conclusion. The anime also never went further than the Kyoto Arc.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PanzerWorldGalient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PanzerWorldGalient">Panzer World Galient</a></em>: After twenty-six episodes, the anime sort of just... ends abruptly, without final confrontation among the hero and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> or his Dragon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PetShopOfHorrors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PetShopOfHorrors">Pet Shop of Horrors</a></em> only had FOUR episodes made, there's no introduction of the plot from the manga or any explanation of why Count D does what he does, for a ten volume Manga (which is complete and with a sequel in progress) it is very disappointing that the anime didn't get into any of it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> While not the whole anime obviously, a storyline that happened during the Unova saga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> was cut short by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Said storyline involved Team Rocket searching for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">Meteonite</a> and was going to conclude with them clashing with Team Plasma (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">the episodes were even made</a>) before the tsunami occured. Because of that, the arc was never resolved and Team Plasma didn't show up in the anime until after the Unova League, and when they finally did in the Episode N arc, the two unaired episodes were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> into having never happened for the English dub. TV Tokyo still holds the two-part arc conclusion and has maintained that they will be broadcast in Japan someday, but when that someday is no-one can say. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Various trailers and a synopsis based on leaked information show that it went pretty much how one would expect it to go - with Team Plasma stealing the Meteonite from Team Rocket, the two teams fighting over it, and Ash intervening and having Pikachu destroy it to end the conflict.</span>
</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">Pokémon Gold and Silver</a></em> manga, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonGoldenBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonGoldenBoys">Pokémon Golden Boys</a></em>, ended abruptly after three volumes. It didn't finish the Johto arc. Despite numerous references to Red, we never see him.
</li><li> On a more obscure note, the second installment in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TakeshiShudo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TakeshiShudo">Takeshi Shudō</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/PocketMonstersTheAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/PocketMonstersTheAnimation">novelizations</a> of the anime included a "to be continued" note in the afterword, but the third volume was never released, plus Shudo died in 2010.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Presents</em> ends without main plot thread resolved — after we finally get a hint how it might be a few chapters before the end — and the final collection ends with a piece that doesn't even match the theme of the rest of the series.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrettyFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrettyFace">Pretty Face</a></em> manga was also cut short. While the ending was clearly intentional, only one of the major plot points was resolved on screen, and a whole additional year passed with the basic premise, with no clear reason why that didn't deserve to be shown, whilst the year we did see did.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessRouge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessRouge">Princess Rouge</a></em> was supposed to be six episodes long, but funding ran dry, and it got cut off at two episodes, with the second episode even going so far as to hint at a new villain for the third episode... which does not exist.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Prism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Prism">Prism</a></em> was put on an indefinite hiatus and eventually cancelled due to scandals involving the mangaka and plagiarism.
</li><li> The anime of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PsychicAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PsychicAcademy">Psychic Academy</a></em> ends after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeachEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeachEpisode">Beach Episode</a>, barely a third of the way through the manga storyline. Not only does it not resolve the love triangle, it barely managed to finish defining it!
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster">Rave Master</a></em> anime just ends right after the introduction of Lucia, the true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the series, is shown. The show had promptly been canceled due to low ratings and it's assumed this was a gambit to get readers to check out the manga to see what happens next.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RozenMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RozenMaiden">Rozen Maiden</a></em>, whose anime <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga">Overtook the Manga</a> and whose manga tragically ended with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> (and an apology) following a dispute between the producers and the publishers. The manga did get a sequel that picks up almost right where the original left off.
</li><li> Anime based upon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi">Rumiko Takahashi</a>'s manga seem usually subject to this. The anime versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura">Urusei Yatsura</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RINNE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RINNE">RIN-NE</a></em> are all Cut Short. Possibly because Takahashi manga are so long. However, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura">Urusei Yatsura</a></em> did get a theatrical wrap-up and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em> was eventually finished with a second anime series called <em>Inuyasha: The Final Act</em>, which covered the manga from the point where the first series left off to its conclusion, albeit in abridged form.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolZone1996" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolZone1996">School Zone</a></em> ends with the lead characters discovering what they have to do to put an end to the thirteen ghost stories... and ending the current crisis at the school as they start on it. It ends without their actually finishing their new task... and without fully resolving the subplot regarding the mystery of twins Mako and Miko.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Toriko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Toriko">Mitsutoshi Shimabukuro's</a> original Weekly Jump manga <em>Seikimatsu Leader den Takeshi!</em> was cut after five years due to his conviction of soliciting an underage prostitute.
</li><li> <em>Silent Moebius</em> ends like this. The manga, however, completes the story... and was released before the series, so its a rare case of the trope working in reverse.
</li><li> Tatsunoko Productions' '90s remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpeedRacer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpeedRacer">Speed Racer</a></em> was planned to be 52 episodes, but a change in directors and a significant drop in ratings caused the series to wind up overhauled midway through production. It wound up being pulled after 34 episodes were produced. A dub of this version titled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpeedRacerX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpeedRacerX">Speed Racer X</a></em> would air on Nickelodeon in 2003, but only got through 13 episodes before it was abruptly cancelled due to Speed Racer Enterprises filing a lawsuit against DiC over ownership rights to the dub.
</li><li> Seems to be a curse with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpiderRiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpiderRiders">Spider Riders</a></em>. The manga ended after 10 chapters, when the magazine which serialized it was discontinued. It was never picked-up elsewhere. As for the anime itself, original plans for the show revealed that it would have an actual conclusive ending. However, to make room for a second season, the ending was made open instead. That second season never came, and viewers are still left wondering about Aqune's past/whether her memories will return, whether Hunter ever intends to go back to his own world, and any romantic resolution, among other things. And as for the novels, there were supposed to be five. Fans get... three and a half?

</li><li> The last episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Carnivale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Carnivale">Carnivàle</a></em> left multiple plot threads unexplained, as well as introducing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> and a resurrection in the last few minutes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Class2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Class2016">Class (2016)</a></em>, spin-off of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>, was cancelled after one season due to low ratings, mixed reception and creator Patrick Ness leaving the show. This effectively ended the show on two cliffhangers: the Governors staging the invasion of the Weeping Angels and April coming back to life in the body of Corakinus.
</li><li> <em>Cliffhangers</em>, from 1979, a game attempt by NBC to popularize the concept of old-time movie serials in a weekly television series format. Each week had three installments:
<ul><li> "Stop Susan Williams", inspired by the old <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePerilsOfPauline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePerilsOfPauline">The Perils of Pauline</a></em> serio-dramas of the 1930s. Here, the "Pauline" character is filled by model Susan Anton as the title character, a journalist who, while investigating her brother's murder, discovers that the killing was part of an international conspiracy.
</li><li> "The Secret Empire", a U.S. marshal who discovers a futuristic underground city. This installment was based on "The Phantom Empire" movie serial starring Gene Autry.
</li><li> "The Curse of Dracula", about the famous Bram Stoker character taking the guise of a college professor, in an attempt to achieve mortality. <br/>Only one of these — "The Curse of Dracula" — reached its conclusion within the 10-week run. Low ratings and the absurdity of the storylines, plus ABC's one-two punch of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays">Happy Days</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LaverneAndShirley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LaverneAndShirley">Laverne &amp; Shirley</a></em>, turned "Cliffhangers" into a show that truly left the viewer hanging after cancellation. As a postscript, the "Stop Susan Williams" and "The Secret Empire" installments were re-edited into two-hour "made-for-TV" movies for later re-airing by NBC, and included their intended conclusions.
<ul><li> In a rare double-tap of the trope, "The Curse of Dracula" episodes were re-edited into two two-hour movies for syndication. Only the first ever aired.
</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Constantine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Constantine">Constantine</a></em> originally planned to have multiple seasons adapting various characters and storylines from the comics, but was cut down to only 13 episodes and ended without any resolution to the story arc.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMindsSuspectBehavior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMindsSuspectBehavior">Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior</a></em> ends on a particularly cruel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger">Cliffhanger</a>—barring a miracle, either one main character is dead or another killed a man in cold blood, and we'll never find out which it was.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dallas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dallas">Dallas</a></em>:
<ul><li> The 14th season finale, "Conundrum", also was billed as the series' finale of the original CBS version. However, the episode itself was not unlike the other season finales (a massive plot development to entice the audience into tuning in that fall). Here, J.R. fears he has lost his empire and everyone that means everything to him, and contemplating suicide, is visited by an angel(?), who, in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulPlot">It's a Wonderful Plot</a>-type dream, shows him how others would have fared without him. In the end, J.R. trains the gun at his own head; Bobby, concerned for J.R.'s welfare, arrives at Southfork just in time to hear gunfire coming from J.R.'s bedroom, rushes to the door and says, "Oh my God!" Viewers are left to wonder whether J.R. killed himself ... a question that wouldn't be answered for another five years and the first of the reunion movies.
</li><li> The 2012 reboot was cancelled abruptly at the end of the third season, leaving numerous unresolved plot lines, although given how many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">Aborted Arcs</a> there were from the first two seasons, there's no guarantee they would have been resolved anyway.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadLikeMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadLikeMe">Dead Like Me</a></em>: a rare inversion of this trope. Although the series was cancelled abruptly after only two seasons, the show's somewhat unique storytelling format, which resulted in most episodes ending in such a way that they could almost all stand as finales, allowed it to end in a satisfying manner (so much so, a later revival TV movie was seen as superfluous).
</li><li> In the UK original version of the series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DearJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DearJohn">Dear John</a></em>, its star Ralph Bates died in 1991, so plans to continue the series were scrapped.

The sets were destroyed by the time the episodes were shown, dashing all hopes of a revival. While by that point, the identity of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Beta</span> was revealed, this raised more questions than it answered. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> helped fill in some of the blanks but not enough to get an idea of where the show was going.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Drive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Drive">Drive</a></em> only lasted 6 episodes with the final episode showing the main characters robbing a bank and one of them getting shot and bleeding badly.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EnemyAtTheDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EnemyAtTheDoor">Enemy at the Door</a></em> was set in the German-occupied Channel Islands during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. It was cancelled after two seasons without any kind of wrap-up, stopping halfway through the war with the Germans still in occupation and the ultimate fates of the individual characters unresolved.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em>; canceled on a cliffhanger (due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">being cancelled after the producers were assured of renewal</a>, which was later resolved in the miniseries <em>Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars</em>.

Gibbons' wall of crazy said, and why <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">2016 meant "The End"</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilligansIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilligansIsland">Gilligan's Island</a></em> never got a finale in the show itself. You can blame that on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gunsmoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gunsmoke">Gunsmoke</a></em>'s fanbase; the series was very popular and wouldn't have been cancelled if the <em>Gunsmoke</em> fandom wasn't so invested in keeping that series on the air. If <em>Gilligan</em> had been solidly renewed for a fourth season instead of falling victim to the <em>Gunsmoke</em> fanbase, the castaways probably would've succeeded in getting off the island during the fourth season. There were, however, a few TV movies that tried to wrap up the series.
<ul><li> Lampshaded in numerous later references to the castaways forever being stuck on that island. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GalaxyQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GalaxyQuest">"Those poor people..."</a>

No ending was ever produced because the series was cancelled due to low ratings.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHour">The Hour</a></em> ended its second season on a massive cliffhanger (Freddie was left beaten senseless outside Lime Grove Studios) and was canceled soon after.

Not because of ratings, but because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">channel it airs on</a> was on transition.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Intelligence2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Intelligence2006">Intelligence</a></em> was cancelled abruptly after two seasons.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JoanOfArcadia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JoanOfArcadia">Joan of Arcadia</a></em> ended with her meeting the mysterious Ryan Hunter, who apparently either also spoke to God in the past or spoke to the Devil or <em>was</em> the Devil.

Watching the rest of the episodes, especially the last, shows they were building up to something, and while there thankfully wasn't a cliffhanger, none of the character arcs were even kinda resolved.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyleXY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyleXY">Kyle XY</a></em> ended with Kyle uncovering a nefarious plot and discovering <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the identity of his mother</span>. It's left on a cliffhanger with Kyle only partially stopping the plot. It's left unresolved who his true love interest is. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> described the rest of the series in broad strokes. Very annoying as the series was cancelled halfway through the season and no moves were made to provide even the slightest hint of a better resolution.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LasVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LasVegas">Las Vegas</a></em>. The Writer's Strike resulted in its season finale being very abrupt, ending with <em>To Be Continued...</em>. Unfortunately, the show was not brought back for another season, ending the story on a total cliffhanger.
</li><li> After the third season, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LieToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LieToMe">Lie to Me</a></em> wasn't renewed. So the series basically concluded on the season ender, which included Lightman admitting to his daughter that he loves Foster.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark">Lois &amp; Clark</a></em> ends with them finding a baby that does not belong to them. There would have been more explanation of the baby's origins had the show continued. This was the same episode where they were told that Kryptonians are genetically incompatible with humans (or, at least, Clark and Lois aren't), destroying their hopes of starting a biological family.

Also, for four seasons, viewers had never known who Dodge's father was (though Earl was <em>not</em> a likely candidate for several reasons) and had assumed that Darnell was the father of "Earl Junior" (given that they're both black, while Joy and Earl are white). The last episode reveals that <em>Earl</em> is Dodge's dad (which makes some jokes in the episode "Guess Who's Coming Out Of Joy" Harsher in Hindsight), and proves that Darnell <em>isn't</em> Earl Junior's dad. The episode ended just as Joy was about to begin explaining, and then the series got canceled. We don't even know how far along on his list Earl was, or what he had left to do.

</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, they originally planned for the series to end with Earl encountering someone with a list of their own with him on it, and when he asks them where they got the idea, they reply that they got it from someone else with a list. Earl then realizes that his list started a chain reaction of other people with lists trying to right their own wrongs, and he tears up his own list and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidingIntoTheSunset" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidingIntoTheSunset">walks into the sunset</a> a free man, after realizing that he's finally put more good into the world than bad.

While some of these career changes seemed poised to start a spin-off series (Christine is elected to Congress) most of them seemed poised to continue the series. Perhaps the strangest of these was bailiff Bull Shannon being persuaded to leave Earth by humanoid aliens who needed a tall guy to reach the things on their high shelves...
<ul><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock">30 Rock</a></em> was built around shooting a proper finale for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightCourt">Night Court</a></em>.

In the making-of documentary on the DVD set released in 2014, show creator / executive producer Glenn Gordon Caron revealed that this was a deliberate ploy aimed at CBS to keep the show on the air and he never would have done it if he didn't think it had a good chance of working.

<ul><li> The World Series, the championship of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>, has been canceled on two occasions in history, leaving that year's MLB season cut short without any champion.
<ul><li> The first time, in 1904, it was because John McGraw, the owner of the National League championship team, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity">New York</a> Giants (now the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanFrancisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanFrancisco">San Francisco</a> Giants), refused to have his team face the American League champions, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Boston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Boston">Boston</a> Americans (now the Boston Red Sox). His reasons were petty: he felt that the American League was inferior to the National League, and that his Giants, having won the National League championship, had already proven themselves to be the best. Therefore, in his eyes, the World Series was little more than an exhibition series.
</li><li> The second time, in 1994, the entire MLB postseason was canceled due to <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994&lt;!--E2--&gt;80%9395_Major_League_Baseball_strike">a players' strike<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Perhaps the hardest-hit team was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Montreal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Montreal">Montreal</a> Expos, who had been racking up a "dream season" that year; they had won more games than any other team that year, and were among the favorites to win the World Series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICouldaBeenAContender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICouldaBeenAContender">(which would've been their first)</a>. The Expos <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorKiller">never recovered from the strike-shortened season</a>; they fell into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Age</a> in the second half of the '90s, and they eventually moved to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WashingtonDC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WashingtonDC">Washington, D.C.</a> and became the Nationals in 2004.
</li></ul></li><li> A Number of televised football leagues have suspended operations during a season.
<ul><li> The first was the World Football League, which ended in the middle of her 2nd season in 1975.
</li><li> The United Football League suspended 2 seasons early. The first was in 2011 after 4 weeks, though a Championship and Consolation Games were played. The second time was in 2012 again after 4 weeks, but no games were held.
</li><li> The Alliance of American Football ended during its first and only season after week 8 with no resolution. While the league was losing money, this was not the primary reason for the cancellation and was instead based on a dispute of the owner and the league founders with the NFL Player Association.
</li></ul></li><li> Due to a flu epidemic that lead to the death of Montreal Canadians defenseman Joe Hall, the 1919 Stanley Cup Final was cancelled with 1 game to go in the series.
</li><li> The attacks of September 11th, 2001 caused the cancellation of a number of sports events and seasons.
<ul><li> The 2001 Women's US Cup Soccer was cancelled half-way through the event.
</li><li> All Minor League Games were cancelled for the remainder of the Regular and Post-Seasons with each league declaring a champion with the team with the best regular season record to that point (or co-champions if there would be a playoff).
</li><li> Major League Soccer cancelled the remaining two weeks of the regular season. While the playoffs did take place, the Tampa Bay Mutiny, who failed to make the playoffs, were contracted at the end without having an official final game.
</li><li> The 2001 Ryder Cup, a biennial US vs Europe Golf Event, was cancelled. The tournament restarted in 2002 and is now held on even numbered years. The Presidents Cup and the Solheim Cup were also rescheduled to take place in odd numbered years starting in 2003.
</li></ul></li><li> While withdrawals are always a possibility in any heads-up individual events, it is fairly common in Doubles Tennis (especially Mixed Doubles) during a Major Event. One of the 4 contestants withdraws "due to injury" in the Semi or Final Round to concentrate on an individual major, resulting in the winning team never taking the court.

Beginning from the 2009 line, the creative team attempted a drastic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool">Retool</a>, taking the story away from the Matoran Universe onto other planets. They eagerly planned the story ahead for at least 3 years, there is evidence to believe that some sets were also partially designed, they contracted voice actors and made a trilogy-starter movie, wrote a draft for the sequel, the story writer was covered up to his glasses in all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot">potential plot threads he set up</a>, and fan interaction hiked... then, Mr. LEGO called that they're canceling the line. Although in 2010, 6 meager little figures <em>were</em> released (though reluctantly, and under the guise of a 10th year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration">Milestone Celebration</a> commemorative line, in place of the sets they originally wanted to make), and the writer was allowed to continue the stories, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> soon forced him to just abandon the whole thing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftHanging">leaving a tremendous amount of plotlines unresolved</a>. Despite how tragic this may sound, the line still lasted for an impressive decade, while most other LEGO themes only go for just a couple years.

At least its story got a haphazard conclusion, though many secrets were left unanswered.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/EverAfterHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/EverAfterHigh">Ever After High</a></em> was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise">Cash Cow Franchise</a> for several years, but a change in the market towards smaller toys (amongst other issues) led to decreased toy sales by the mid-2010s. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheMerchandise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheMerchandise">As a result</a> the series was quietly put on "hiatus" circa 2017. The problem is that <em>Ever After High</em> was a <em>story-centric</em> toyline and yet the story wasn't even close to ending. The whole "Royals vs Rebels" issue was never resolved. Blatantly, 2016's <em>Dragon Games</em> special had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation">potential</a> game-changer with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Daring failing to wake up Apple with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueLovesKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueLovesKiss">True Love's Kiss</a>, only for his <em>sister</em> Darling to give Apple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CPRCleanPrettyReliable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CPRCleanPrettyReliable">CPR</a>.

Unfortunately, due to Rovios decision to switch to a series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedlyFreeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedlyFreeGame">Allegedly Free Game</a> spinoffs, the story ended there, with Gale never being fightable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Conduit2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Conduit2">Conduit 2</a></em> ended with the protagonist accidentally drawing the attention of an alien ship out in deep space, causing it to travel towards Earth, followed by several former Presidents of the USA (decked out in power armour) showing up to help him save the world. The chances of the series getting a third and final game to round out the trilogy, however, were dashed following the game's mediocre critical reception and awful sales (coming in at just over a fifth of the sales of the original <em>Conduit</em>). Aside from a mobile port of the original game in 2013, the series fell off the face of the earth following the second game's release in 2011, with not even a hint of it being in development for the entirety of the following console generation.
</li><li> The episodic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/D4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/D4">D4</a></em> remains incomplete at one season due to director Swery starting his own company — and his previous company won't sell him the rights to his games.

Brethren Moons have reached the Earth and are likely to destroy it and Isaac. Since the developer company is defunct now, this could never be resolved.

The developers just barely had enough time to go over the lengthy amounts of content which were cut or planned from the game before their license for developing <em>Evolve</em> was taken.

This ending made people pitch for a resolution, and a few months later Ubisoft released the DLC "Epilogue" that adds few more hours after the first ending, They go in a ruined temple overrun by the recent corruption to seek refuge, Elika is extremely angry (slapping him) at the Prince for releasing the god of darkness but they work together to get out of the temple while fighting Elika's father, now one of Ahriman's corrupted. For the whole DLC Elika keeps a grudge to the prince, despite him explaining that he did that because Ahriman when he would have been freed nothing could have stopped him with Elika dead, while saying that she is capable of stopping him and that Ahriman fears her, Elika instead scolds the prince for having put the world to its doom for her, saying that she's incapable of stopping him. At the end, when the two manage to get to the end, Elika simply abandons the prince to his fate while saying that she needs to find her people and leaves, without a single goodbye, with the prince calling out at her, ending with Ahriman saying that the prince was now alone, a clear "to be continued" message.

<ul><li> Thankfully, in 2015, Nickelodeon — on a nostalgia kick with the success of TeenNick's The 90's Are All That/The Splat block — announced that they were finally giving <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnoldTheJungleMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnoldTheJungleMovie">The Jungle Movie</a></em> the green light as a two-part TV movie in 2017. Bartlett and most of the original crew, including several of the voice actors, returned as well, much to the delight of fans.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LittleBill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LittleBill">Little Bill</a></em> was another show that wound up being cancelled when a voice actor who worked on it passed away, with the person in question being Gregory Hines, the voice of Big Bill.

Unfortunately, Adult Swim and Brendon Smalls had a disagreement about the terms for the series, which led to its final season canceled. Many fans even signed a petition for it, but it fell on deaf ears and Adult Swim kept the rights to the Dethklok name. So instead, Brendon made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> in the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrendonSmallsGalaktikon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrendonSmallsGalaktikon">Brendon Small's Galaktikon</a>, which served as an audio finale to the series.

The franchise was then rebooted back to the Classic designs and universe due to dwindling reception of the reboot, leaving Pacs quest to find his parents in a mystery.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhantomInvestigators" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhantomInvestigators">Phantom Investigators</a></em> didn't end on a major cliffhanger, the final episode of its first and only season did imply that more was to come. Due to dissatisfaction with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlShowGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlShowGhetto">not having enough male viewers and too many female viewers</a>, Kids' WB canned the show as fast as it could. Taken even further in America as Kids' WB was so upset at not getting the exact demographic that they wanted that they removed the show from the schedule after only six episodes had aired.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePiratesOfDarkWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePiratesOfDarkWater">The Pirates of Dark Water</a></em> is one of the first truly infamous examples of this for cartoons.

Sure, there was no story arcs due to being a preschool show, however the last episode did imply that more was to come. Like with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWackyAdventuresOfRonaldMcDonald" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWackyAdventuresOfRonaldMcDonald">The Wacky Adventures Of Ronald Mc Donald</a></em> mentioned below, it makes you wonder what the creators were planning next.

Instead, a comic went into publication that acted as a spiritual season 5, which left some hope intact. This hope was validated when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a> picked up the series for a fifth and final season in 2017 on its Toonami block, with Tartakovsky returning as executive producer, wrapping up Jack's adventure after a 13-year hiatus.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheZow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheZow">SheZow</a></em> just <em>stops</em> after the initial 26-episode run, giving the impression that the series was intended to continue past the first season. Indeed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says the show was initially greenlit by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheHub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheHub">The Hub</a> Network for a second season, only for the network to change their minds a month later.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Silverwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Silverwing">Silverwing</a></em> ended after just 13 episodes before the rest of the novels could be adapted for television. Thankfully it did conclude the second books story, so it was at least able to finish Shades main arc.
</li><li> Two animated shows starring <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> weren't fast enough to get their stories finished before cancellation.

Whoever this new character was, viewers never found out, as the series was abruptly cancelled. Writer Ben Hurst revealed his plans for a third season where the mysterious red eyes belonged to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Naugus, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer">Evil Sorcerer</a> who Robotnik betrayed years prior</span>.

</li><li> Another Spidey example is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan">The Spectacular Spider Man</a></em> which left many a plot thread hanging. You can thank Sony and Disney's purchase of Marvel for this. Sony had to relinquish the television rights to keep the film rights.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManUnlimited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManUnlimited">Spider-Man Unlimited</a></em> ended on a cliffhanger after one season due to low ratings.

The creators were working on a sixth season and had story plans for a seventh and eighth season when Disney acquired the rights to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> franchise and ordered to finish the series, not wanting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop">Channel Hop</a> the show to any of their networks as part of the acquisition. At this point, multiple episodes were still in different stages of production. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResolutionWillNotBeTelevised" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResolutionWillNotBeTelevised">13 episodes were finished and composed Season 6 which aired on</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a>, 8 more were later released on StarWars.com with rough incomplete animation, some finished scripts were also adapted into the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarkDisciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarkDisciple">Dark Disciple</a></em> novel and a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarthMaulSonOfDathomir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarthMaulSonOfDathomir">Son of Dathomir</a></em> comic mini-series. Despite all this, both the last broadcast and the last released episodes serve as a fit ending for the series: one ties up Ahsoka's arc and the other ends with a philosophical conclusion about the greater role of the Jedi in the Clone Wars.
<ul><li> Also helping is that Disney later made the sequel series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em>, with Rex and Ahsoka making appearances.

</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Stoked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Stoked">Stōked</a></em> aired on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> in the United States, the show ended at "Endless Bummer", which was the 22nd episode of the first season. The show had four more episodes of said season, and none of the episodes from the second season aired in the United States.
</li><li> The season 1 finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StrokerAndHoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StrokerAndHoop">Stroker and Hoop</a></em> was as close to a literal cliffhanger as they come. The episode ends with Stroker, Hoop, Double Wide plunging to a chasm when their captor intentionally lands on the release switch, after being held at gunpoint. Sadly, the show was axed afterwards due to financial reasons, though the creators were able to reveal what would have happened in the end, had the show had been renewed for a second season.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SwatKats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SwatKats">SWAT Kats</a></em> didn't end on a Cliffhanger, but it came to an end when the writers still had several episode ideas to put on the table. Consider it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooGoodToLast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooGoodToLast">Too Good to Last</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan">Sym-Bionic Titan</a></em>, which was cancelled because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheMerchandise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheMerchandise">they could not interest toy companies</a> and a splintering of the production team that made it hard to keep it going, despite it being a widely loved show.

At the time of its cancellation, the creators Shannon Eric Denton and Dan Norton were working on story ideas for a second season, which would've lasted for 39 episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TimothyGoesToSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TimothyGoesToSchool">Timothy Goes to School</a></em> ended after two seasons (for a long time, it was assumed both seasons were one single season), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastEpisodeNewCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastEpisodeNewCharacter">with the last episode introducing Mexican student Juanita and her family</a>, while also hinting more was to come.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>. Due to its abrupt cancellation, it ended with many unresolved plotlines and unexplored characters. The creators were able to weave a mostly satisfying ending, but still the final episode itself only resolved a <em>fraction</em> of the many plot points introduced earlier in the season.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Trollz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Trollz">Trollz</a></em> was canned after one season with its second season already in planning, <em>and</em> with the last episode hinting that more was to come. Several second season episodes had their titles prepared, but until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> reveals what those episodes' plots were, the fandom will be left without several answers.
</li><li> Every single one of the videos in the series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWackyAdventuresOfRonaldMcDonald" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWackyAdventuresOfRonaldMcDonald">The Wacky Adventures Of Ronald Mc Donald</a></em> ends with an announcer telling the audience to look for Ronald's next adventure. This includes "The Monster O'McDonaldland Loch" even though it was the last video ever made. There wasn't an overarching story to the episodes so this isn't really painful, but it does make one wonder what the creators were planning next.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WanderOverYonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WanderOverYonder">Wander over Yonder</a></em> met its fate because Disney thought that 80 episodes was long enough for a series, and were going to make more money by showing re-runs on Disney XD rather than giving it a third season. Similar to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloneHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloneHigh">Clone High</a></em>, the show's main conflict was thankfully resolved but unfortunately it still ended on a bit of a cliffhanger.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WolverineAndTheXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WolverineAndTheXMen">Wolverine and the X-Men</a>:</em> The last episode ended with a scene in which Apocalypse rules in the future leaving no clue as to what's going to happen next.

Only 23 episodes aired in the US, finishing with a pretty standard episode and nothing resembling a conclusion. All 26 English dub episodes aired in Canada, the UK, and Australia, ending the series on a really sharp cliffhanger complete with a "To be Continued..." message. To make matters worse, the English dub was the source of many foreign dubs like the Spanish, Dutch, Hungarian, Danish, and Greek dubs, which all ended on the same cliffhanger, while the French, Hebrew, Serbian, and Portuguese dubs were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Uncanceled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Uncanceled">Uncanceled</a> and got their own local dubs of the second half of <em>Tokyo Mew Mew</em>.

The English Dub initially ended when Allen Walker and co. were leaving on a ship still on the search for General Cross with the Millennium Earl and Road Kamelot looking at a large amount of Akuma (that are clearly meant for the exorcists). Then...nothing. The English Dub endded at that point halfway through the series with no plans at the time to dub the other half due to the Japanese licensors asking for more money than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation">Funimation</a> is willing to pay. However, this changed, due to the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation">Funimation</a> has in fact licensed the 2016 series, <em>Hallow</em>, as part of the 2016 Summer Simulcast season, along with licensing the second half of the series a week later on June 30th, 2016.

Unfortunately, they were never able to dub the final season <em>Sailor Stars</em> (the first arc of which directly continued on from the end of <em>SuperS</em>). It wasn't until Viz Media picked up the series and commissioned an entire redub that an English dub of that season was finally announced, or indeed for there to be an official English release of <em>Sailor Stars</em> (a subtitled version of which was posted on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hulu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hulu">Hulu</a> once subs of the rest of the series' run had been re-released there, beginning immediately after Viz had announced the license).

It wasn't until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> found success in the US was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation">Funimation</a> able to give the show a second try and produce an all-new English dub from scratch.
<ul><li> The late-1980s Harmony Gold dub of <em>Dragon Ball</em> was also abandoned after one movie and a couple of episodes.
</li><li> The original FUNimation produced, Saban distributed, Ocean voiced version of <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> ended after 53 episodes (or 56 episodes if the butchered <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheTreeOfMight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheTreeOfMight">The Tree of Might</a></em> three-parter is counted). This led to these 53 episodes being rerun <strong>countless</strong> times on Cartoon Network until FUNimation finally dubbed new episodes. There is a common misconception that the "Ocean dub" continued in Canada only, however this dub (which covered the Cell-Buu arcs) was a completely separate production with drastically different music and many recasts.
</li><li> The infamous "Big Green" dub of the <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> movies ended at the ninth one (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBojackUnbound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBojackUnbound">Bojack Unbound</a></em>) for some unknown reason.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em>'s English dub from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MangaEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MangaEntertainment">Manga Entertainment</a> and Showtime Beyond covered only 36 out of 152 episodes (not including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StreamlinePictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StreamlinePictures">Streamline Pictures</a>' dub of the movie). However <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscotekMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscotekMedia">Discotek Media</a> picked up the series and released it in its entirety subtitled-only (with only the first 36 eps bilingual).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIIRedJacket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIIRedJacket">Lupin III (Red Jacket)</a></em>'s English dub from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Geneon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Geneon">Pioneer</a> and Phuuz was cut short after 80 episodes. This discounts an unrelated English dub of eps. 145 and 155 from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StreamlinePictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StreamlinePictures">Streamline Pictures</a>. Only 25 of those episodes (skipping episode 3) aired on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a> due to low ratings with more episodes released to DVD and broadcast on G4. The DVD releases were canceled due to low sales. There was a rumor that more episodes or even <em>all</em> the episodes were dubbed by Phuuz, but this has never been proven true. All 82 English dub episodes (including 145 and 155) were uploaded to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hulu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hulu">Hulu</a>, but nothing else seemed to come until December 2015 when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Crunchyroll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Crunchyroll">Crunchyroll</a> posted episodes 81-155 subbed in North America, to be followed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscotekMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscotekMedia">Discotek Media</a> announcing that they were going to release the entire series on DVD starting in 2016.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaisonIkkoku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaisonIkkoku">Maison Ikkoku</a></em>'s English dub was initially canceled after episode 36 due to low VHS sales, but was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled">Un-Canceled</a>, and the remaining 60 episodes were dubbed and released years later with a mostly different cast.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em>'s edited English dub from DiC entitled <em>Knights of the Zodiac</em> was canceled after 40 episodes, though only 32 aired on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a>. Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ADVFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ADVFilms">ADV Films</a> (who was releasing the DVDs) was allowed to produce their own uncut English dub, which ended at episode 60 because DiC refused to license anymore episodes. After DiC's license expired, the series remained in limbo for many years before it was rescued by Flatiron Films/Cinedigm, who released a sub-only boxset of the first 73 episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ScienceNinjaTeamGatchaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ScienceNinjaTeamGatchaman">Science Ninja Team Gatchaman</a></em>'s second English dub entitled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GForceGuardiansOfSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GForceGuardiansOfSpace">G-Force: Guardians of Space</a></em> was cut short at episode 80 (covering the first 82 episodes) before a straight uncut English dub of the whole series was done in 2003.
<ul><li> Also, the two sequel series <em>Gatchaman II</em> and <em>Gatchaman Fighter</em> weren't included in ADV's dub and were later released by their successor company, Sentai Filmworks, subtitled-only.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog">Sgt. Frog</a></em>'s English dub originally only covered the initial 51 episodes before it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled">Un-Canceled</a> and reached episode 78. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation">Funimation</a> has the license to the first 104 episodes, but has put their dub on hold. As more years go by, it's looking more and more likely that the dub isn't continuing, and it's extremely unlikely that all 360+ episodes will be localized.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero">The Familiar of Zero</a></em>'s English dub only covered the first season before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Geneon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Geneon">Geneon</a> went under. The series was later rescued by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SentaiFilmworks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SentaiFilmworks">Sentai Filmworks</a>, who chose not to dub the remaining three seasons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a></em>'s English dub also only covered the first season before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Geneon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Geneon">Geneon</a> went under. The sequel series, which explains the plot of the first season, has never been licensed or dubbed (though it got a sub-only release in Australia). Both seasons have been rescued by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SentaiFilmworks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SentaiFilmworks">Sentai Filmworks</a>, but unfortunately, like <em>FoZ</em>, these seasons will not dubbed.
</li><li> The English dub of the 1999 adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em> only covers the original 62 episode run of the television series. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VizMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VizMedia">Viz Media</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDubForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDubForYou">never bothered dubbing the OVAs</a>, <em>which continue the story</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MAR">MÄR</a></em> dub due to Cartoon Network making it an online exclusive and their attempts to broadcast it stifled when they did it out of order and attempts to do it properly pretty much wrecked any chances of it. Due to this, Viz decided to cut their losses and discontinued the dub, which ended at the Zonnen filler arc.
</li><li> The dubs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em> ended in medias res. <em>GX</em> got up to the third season but 4Kids never dubbed the fourth, making the show end on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a>. <em>5Ds</em>' dub stopped right in the middle of the last season just as the villains were putting their endgame into motion.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">4Kids Entertainment</a> dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OjamajoDoremi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OjamajoDoremi">Ojamajo Doremi</a></em> (<em>Magical DoReMi</em>) only covered (most of, barring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">episode 30</a>) the first season of the show. Even then, only twenty-six episodes aired on television, with the remaining episodes all premiering online a year later.
</li><li> The English release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Life" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Life">Life</a></em> was cut short only a few volumes in due to legal issues.
</li><li> The Philippine English dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ZettaiMutekiRaijinOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ZettaiMutekiRaijinOh">Zettai Muteki Raijin-Oh</a></em> ends up until the episode of the 2nd appearance of God Raijin-Oh. They never got to the ending.
</li><li> This was the case for the original Philippine English dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VoltesV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VoltesV">Voltes V</a></em>, due to the Marcos regime banning the show near the series' end. They wouldn't get the last few episodes until a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationMovie">Compilation Movie</a> of the said episodes came out in theaters in 1999.
</li><li> None of the English dubs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CrayonShinChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CrayonShinChan">Crayon Shin-chan</a></em> cover the whole series.
</li><li> The British re-versioning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNoddyShop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNoddyShop">The Noddy Shop</a></em> that aired outside of North America, <em>Noddy In Toyland</em>, where <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/NoddysToylandAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/NoddysToylandAdventures">Noddy's Toyland Adventures</a></em> segments were changed into their original British versions, never aired the second season of the show. This is despite the fact that this is the season that contains Truman gaining the ability to talk to the toys and Johnny, as well as Noddy finally interacting with other characters rather than just being a prop used for stories, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, likely because the segments where Noddy talked would all have to be redubbed by Susan Sheridan, his British voice actor. This season did air dubbed in non-English speaking countries.
