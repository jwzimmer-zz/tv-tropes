Knowing when to just let go is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">useful skill</a> (it may have even indirectly contributed to the creation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheThirtySixStratagems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheThirtySixStratagems">The Thirty-Six Stratagems</a> as an actual list). <em>Sometimes</em> possible to tell that to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFatalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFatalist">The Fatalist</a>, on the other hand, is quite aware of this wisdom.
</p><p>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator</a>, if presented as flawed, will rarely if ever know when to back down, even when it would be beneficial; a Determinator who refuses to back down from a hopeless battle and gets their ass kicked is a very common (and easy) way to show that the threats are getting bigger and that simple iron-willed resolve does absolutely nothing against someone who can jelly you in seconds and shrug off your very worst.

As seen in the prevalence of this trope, it's often a useful evolutionary trait, it's why most people when gambling try to quit when ahead or any situation where risk is involved. After all, you don't get rich playing the stock market like a fool.

<ul><li> In <em>The Black Swordsman</em> story arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>, after Guts's ally Vargas has been captured by the Count's men and about to be executed, Puck asks why Guts isn't going in and rescuing him. The guy who once slew 100 warriors in one sitting, tells Puck to screw off since there's about 50 guards in the area and he's not going to risk fighting so many for a weakling. Instead Guts just witnesses Vargas's execution, leaving Puck to attempt a rescue alone and fail.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em>, TK successfully convinces all but one of the Digi-Destined group to make a strategic withdrawal. Subverted when Davis, the one who isn't convinced, succeeds despite ignoring the logic, but only through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">pure dumb luck.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> this is known as the Saotome Secret Technique, employed by the Saotome School of Anything-Goes Martial Arts. It relies on speed, obfuscation, and contemplation. Or, put more plainly, run away and hide until you come up with a better plan. While introduced mostly as a joke early on, this is actually Ranma's most useful skill, as most of his fights are won less through sheer skill (Having just learned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialArtsAndCrafts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialArtsAndCrafts">how to fight with teacups and teaspoons a few days ago</a>), and more through outsmarting his opponents.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureBattleTendency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureBattleTendency">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Battle Tendency</a></em>, Joseph's final super special plan consists of basically making the best use of his legs. In other words, to run the hell away. He usually comes up with a better plan while he's at it. (It sees use again in the part's finale, and gets a brief <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders">the next part.</a>)
<ul><li> Even Joseph's son Josuke and grandson Jotaro do this occasionally, once again to strategize against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless Boss Fight</a> at first glance.
</li><li> This carries on to Giorno, Joseph's <em>uncle</em>, (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TangledFamilyTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TangledFamilyTree">don't ask how</a>), as he ran away rather than face Koichi and his Echoes Act 3.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> In an early story where Sanji is introduced, the armored pirate "Foul Play' Don Krieg (who's as rotten as his title implies) barges onto the restaurant-ship demanding food for his crew of fifty men. Several of the staff try to drive him off, but are curb-stomped quickly. Eventually, Zeff decides to do the smart thing, and simply give him what he wants, bringing out the food and telling him sternly to take it and go. (Unfortunately, this makes it worse, as Don Krieg recognizes Zeff as the former captain of the Cook Pirates, and now wants to stay around for a different reason.)
</li><li> In the same story arc as the one where Sanji is introduced, Dracule "Hawkeye" Mihawk, the greatest swordsman in the world, shows up pursuing Krieg due to boredom. Later on, Mihawk has fought and beaten Roronoa Zoro, Luffy's crewmate, and been impressed by his spirit. When Krieg tries to attack Hawkeye again (ignoring how the last time his crew fought Hawkeye it cost him his entire fleet save one ship), Krieg's men start begging him to just let Hawkeye leave unmolested.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> For the love of God, if the man wants to leave, <em>let him leave!</em>
</div><ul><li> Luffy decides to order his crew to focus only on running away when facing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Admiral Kizaru, Sentoumaru and Bartholomew Kuma</a>, after having already exhausted themselves beating one of the latter mere moments earlier. Although not their first defeat, this is the first time they've ever run away from a fight. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It doesn't work. By God, it does <em>not</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">work</a>.</span>
</li><li> Akainu also demonstrated this at Marineford. After a lengthy battle against Whitebeard that resulted in huge casualties on both sides and very nearly destroyed Marineford, Akainu was still totally prepared to mop up what was left. When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shanks and his crew</span> showed up, he pulled a 180 and opted to back off and call it a wrap rather than deal with someone on par with the dude who just crippled them in the first place.
<ul><li> Post-timeskip, he displays another moment of restraint when he absolutely refuses to touch the Wano Country, stating that between <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kaido and Big Mom's alliance, the amount of serious heavy hitters in the Wano Country in general, and the abolition of the Shichibukai system and current struggles with former members of the latter</span>, the Marines don't have enough resources to take on that many serious heavy hitters and not get stomped into the ground.
</li></ul></li><li> Blackbeard, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gaining Whitebeard's Devil Fruit abilities</span>, opted to quit while he was ahead and get the hell out of there. Sure, he may have just gained an <em>enormous</em> power boost, but considering that he had very nearly been killed by an enraged Whitebeard moments before and was going to have to deal with the likes of Sengoku, the Admirals, the Warlords, and tons of other major-league hitters with something that he had no experience with using if he pressed the attack, he was <em>very</em> smart to take the safe road.
</li><li> Doflamingo also demonstrated this after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kuzan showed up at Punk Hazard and stopped him from killing Smoker</span>. Yeah, he probably could have done okay against him. That wasn't the point, however; he came to Punk Hazard to clean up a mess and eliminate key witnesses to activities that he didn't want the World Government to know about, not fight an <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ex-Admiral</span>, and he already had enough on his plate as is and didn't need anything else that could add to it.

<ul><li> It is stated on numerous occasions that it is a trainer's duty to end the battle if there is any serious danger to their Pokémon (the first battles with Brock, Sabrina, and Blaine all ended in this fashion). However, this is pretty much a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a> as Ash will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">determinate</a> himself through anything, even winning one badge when Pryce forfeited despite Ash ignoring the option to do the same earlier.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0s8wu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0s8wu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0s8wu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It should be noted however, this is less a broken aesop, and more of the "difference between TV show and games" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>. In the games, the player doesn't have this option when fighting against other trainers (especially gym leaders). The player must see each battle to the end, just like any other RPG boss fight.</span>
</li><li> Ash was also berated for making his Treecko continue to fight Brawly's Hariyama despite Treecko having no chance to win.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1wau6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1wau6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1wau6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which again, would have to happen in the games.</span> It didn't help that he was almost ready to give up before, but Treecko got up anyway. Ash was pretty pissed at himself for making that decision to continue after he lost. We do run into the problem that Ash's Pokémon take after his personality; they all hate to give up.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2xp0j');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2xp0j" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2xp0j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which isn't a bad thing, since perseverance does result in victory sometimes.</span>
</li><li> The <em>Team Rocket trio</em> did this for a good portion of the Unova arc. When things start going too far south, they get the heck of there instead of fighting until they're sent blasting off. It's worked much better for them.
</li><li> They do it again near the end of the <em>XY</em> series, where the twerps' Pokemon have become so overpowered even they lampshade <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">they don't stand a chance anymore</a>, working in the background until the twerps disband to other regions and Ash is vulnerable again.
</li><li> Also came back to haunt Ash during his first full battle with Paul. Ash was once going to withdraw Buizel, since it had taken massive damage from Paul's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> Ursaring. This would have been the logical thing to do, but Buizel gives Ash the thumbs up, signaling it can still fight. Ash leaves Buizel in...and it gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">massacred</a>. Ash was called out on this by Paul's brother Reggie who stated that Buizel was eliminated due to poor judgment by Ash.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3whkq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3whkq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3whkq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This happens <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">a lot</a> in the anime.</span> Moral: The trainer is responsible for knowing when a Pokemon should be switched out, and relying simply on faith in your Pokemon doesn't cut it when the odds are stacked against you.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note47xjz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note47xjz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note47xjz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Except when</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop">it does</a>.</span>

Kyurem and the other Swords of Justice praise him for his good judgment.
</li><li> Another early Kanto arc example is in "The Punchy Pokemon", where Anthony convinces Brock to throw in the towel when it's clear Geodude vs. Hitmonlee is a mismatch. Anthony himself does the same when his daughter Rebecca nearly gets herself seriously injured protecting his defenseless Hitmonchan.

<ul><li> Forfeiting the match against the Hakushuu Dinosaurs is also the reason Taiyo Sphinx quarterback Kiminari Harao is still walking properly; If he had kept the game going, the Dinosaurs' monstrous Rikiya Gaou would've definitely crippled him. The Sphinx had no other option but to forfeit as <em>they had no linemen left.</em>
</li><li> In a literal gambling example, Hiruma folds in a poker game against Clifford when he realizes that Clifford has the winning hand (hopefully this isn't foreshadowing.) This was played as a win on Hiruma's part though, since the real game was a bluff-off between himself and Clifford. Clifford had the better hand and was not happy that Hiruma folded before he could show that he had won.

Rosette—being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator</a>—argues with him, shouting "Why are you saying we should give up?!" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She then grabs his arm as he tries to take her away.

</li><li> Simon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em> is an insanely badass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator</a>, but is rational enough to walk away from a fight once he's exhausted every other option. This is the principal difference between him and Kamina. However, this isn't always a good thing. When Kamina and Simon were first fighting Thymilph, everyone was trying to convince them to retreat, before Simon himself points out they may need to this one time. However, Kamina (correctly) points out that they can't. If they did, they would be putting the others in danger because they'd be chased. This ends up with Simon taking advantage of a cliff to sink the Dai-Gunzan and win them the battle.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> - One of Lelouch Lamperouge's flaws is his inability to back down. This stems from a personal variation on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SunkCostFallacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SunkCostFallacy">Sunk Cost Fallacy</a>: if he doesn't achieve his goals, then all the people who died aiding him will have their deaths rendered meaningless. That, and he simply refuses to accept defeat.
<ul><li> He plays it straight during the Battle of Narita by ordering a retreat after Kallen loses her Radiant Surger Wave claw in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina">Diabolus ex Machina</a>. He knows full well that in spite of his side's tactical advantage this battle, continuing would be a war of attrition. Exactly one season later, Schneizel himself orders a retreat, only in this case on account of Zero inciting a rebellion in China via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredPublicConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredPublicConfession">publicly exposing the eunuchs' plans</a>, knowing that the eunuchs are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating">nothing without the support of the public</a>.
</li><li> Also, while Lelouch hates backing down once a battle has started, he also recognises that he is hopelessly outmatched in terms of brute strength, so generally prefers to use guerilla tactics. In addition to the Battle of Narita, there are a few other times when he doesn't continue to press his advantage because it would become a war of attrition, and his battles often end with him ordering his forces to use various pre-planned escape routes, showing that he does fully appreciate the necessity of retreating, even if he hates doing it.

<ul><li> In the Grand Magic Games, the free-for-all event on the start of the second day has the participants race across a series of carts, an event that Dragon Slayers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">who are susceptible to motion sickness</a>, don't stand a chance of winning. The event awards points based on how well the participants do, with 10 points for the winner and 0 for the one in last place, so the Dragon Slayers could, at most, hope for sixth place and two points. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy">Sting</a>, who's competing for Saber Tooth(which is in the lead at the moment), decides it isn't worth the humiliation, and drops out after a brief conversation with his rivals Natsu and Gajeel (whose teams are at the back of the pack), whereas Natsu barely passes Gajeel to get sixth place. Sting ends up coming to regret this decision after Natsu defeats him and Rogue, resulting in Natsu's team pulling <em>one point</em> ahead of Saber Tooth. In the end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sting surrenders rather than fight the five members of Fairy Tail's combined team, even though he's uninjured and they're on their last legs, since he's come to realize how determiend they are</span>.

Only once has an entire UE attack force been wiped out in the course of a battle, and that's because they were blindsided by two extremely powerful mobile suits they had no way of predicting. In every other case, they've retreated the moment the battle started going against them. This stops happening past the first season though... perhaps the vanguard force was more elite than the main army.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>, Yugi and his grandpa Solomon both did this. It turned out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">Generation Xerox</a> battle. Yugi's grandpa conceded a duel (water was at stake; they were stranded in Egypt) because his friend was in more need of the water. Years later, Yugi duels the other guy's granddaughter who had a related grudge. The duel went pretty much the way the old duel went, to the point that Yugi concedes at the exact same point: just before drawing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>. In Yugi's case, winning wouldn't have settled the grudge, and when the gentlemen revealed just what Yugi had done, the granddaughter finally realizes Yugi hadn't been acting selfish at all (which she had been believing the whole time).
<ul><li> In Yugi and Mai's match during the Duelist Kingdom finals, when Yugi manages to summon Black Luster Soldier, Mai surrenders immediately, because it just destroyed her most powerful monster and she doesn't have anything else in her deck that can come close to beating it.

He fought Temari and appeared to have her beaten, then gave up at the last minute. It's because of this that he gets promoted to Chuunin.
<div class="indent"><strong>Shikamaru:</strong> "I used up too much chakra, using the Shadow Imitation so many times. I can only hold you for an additional ten seconds. So I've thought about 200 possible moves...but time's up. It's too troublesome to do more."
</div><ul><li> Itachi and Kisame did this twice during their attempt to capture Naruto. The first was when Guy showed up; while they had dealt with Kakashi, Asuma, and Kurenai fairly handily and probably could have dealt with Guy as well, they retreated because they figured that Guy was the first of many and they weren't equipped to fight off a bunch of jonin. The second time was against Jiraiya; the minute he showed up and made it clear that he wasn't playing, Kisame admitted that he would stomp them in a fight and they immediately abandoned the mission and fled.

Unfortunately, this proves to be more of a hindrance a lot of the time, as running isn't always an option, and with his tendency to underestimate himself, it ends up holding him back from going all-out. This provides a hilarious moment when he and Gon are trapped in a room by Nobunaga. With Nobunaga blocking the only way out of the room and being far too strong for the two of them to fight, they suddenly rush him...only to break down the walls of the room and flee. When Nobunaga runs out to look for them, Killua declares that they'll come out to face him...only to take Gon and flee the building while Nobunaga waits for them to show themselves. It's later subverted when it turns out this behavior is actually manipulation from his older brother Illumi, who is overbearingly protective of him. To ensure he never fights opponents stronger than himself, he planted a mind-controlling needle in his forehead that puts that instinct in his mind. Once Killua figures this out, he immediately removes the needle, and along with it, the crippling desire to run.

She and Magog raid a Government building where the Girl of Steel is resting but they're curbstomped by a Supergirl's ally. Selena judges it's time to cut her losses and teleports away.
<div class="indent"><strong>Selena:</strong> Well. This fight is certainly going in a direction. I think I will, too. <br/><strong>Magog:</strong> Selena! You can't just desert me! We're in this, coward! <br/><strong>Selena:</strong> Read the fine print, Magog. I didn't sign up for werewolves. Have fun.
</div></li><li> Both Romans and Pirates in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Asterix">Asterix</a></em> comics give up fighting at some point. The pirates are infamous for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">sinking their own ship</a> once they realise there are Gauls on the other vessel and they can't run away fast enough.
<ul><li> Even more noteworthy is Julius Caesar's use of this trope, because he isn't acting like a snivelling coward and it isn't played for laughs. Au contraire, he often appears at the end of a story, granting amnesty to Asterix and Obelix and even doing a few favours... because they have already fought through tooth and nail and the only way to save face and avoid a humiliating defeat, is acting in acceptance. Asterix usually plays along because it would complicate matters a little otherwise.
</li></ul></li><li> At least twice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> has used the schtick that an alien force is intent on invading Earth only for one person doing the research to realize they are trying to invade a planet that has defended itself successfully, multiple times, against other invading aliens, multiple galactic empires (<em>at the same time</em>), cosmic entities no one else in the universe has ever managed to even slow down, and is home to entities capable of eating stars, assorted deities, and a Watcher who thinks the planet rocks so much he's actually done stuff instead of merely observing. One time the fleet commander listens and does a u-turn. Another, not so much. The invasion is defeated by three X-Men (one of them drunk).
<ul><li> Made literal in the latter case when one group of the invaders backs off when faced with a lethal bet in a card game against Wolverine.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MarvelAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MarvelAdventures">Marvel Adventures</a></em> Bullseye demonstrates that he knows not to punch above his weight class.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> always shot down his suggestion that they quit while they were ahead.
</li><li> This is a part of what has always made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom">Doctor Doom</a> such a capable antagonist. Unlike most supervillains, Doom can recognise when the plan has gone south and it's time to leave. Yeah, Reed Richards is still alive, and you don't have what you came here for. It doesn't matter. It's time to go. Long before he had his diplomatic immunity, Doom regularly got away by having planned his escape in advance, and leaving the minute he was in danger of being surrounded. In one instance, he fights the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a> tooth and nail trying to get to Mjolnir and claim it, eventually beating them, grasping the handle and, predictably, being unable to budge it. Rather than rage at his failure or try to take it out on anyone nearby, he simply shrugs and goes home.
<ul><li> In another notable example, Doom and the Avengers just concluded an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> against Attuma, but Doom being Doom steals the machine Attuma had been using in preparation for one of his plots. The Avengers pursue and fight him, but the Vision chooses to sneak in and destroy the machine rather than risk it being used by anyone. Doom immediately realises what has happened and curses the Vision, but then simply flies away rather than continue a pointless battle. The Avengers briefly debate continuing the pursuit, but also decide that continued conflict is pointless.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MisterFantastic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MisterFantastic">Reed Richards</a> once contacted an alien invasion fleet right before they were about to attack Earth. In the middle of introducing himself, the aliens realized who he was (the supergenius leader of the group that has foiled other alien invasions and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Galactus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Galactus">Galactus</a> himself) and wisely got the hell away from Earth.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> is a Determinator of the highest calibur. When he first encountered the Juggernaut in Amazing Spider-Man issue 229, he launches repeated attacks in futile attempt to slow the villain down. In the follow-up issue, Spidey becomes so desperate he starts using attacks that would cripple or kill even the hardiest of his usual enemies, culminating in him ramming a fully-loaded fuel truck right into Juggernaut and being shocked the guy was still standing. In a later encounter, Juggernaut bluntly tells Spider-Man he was just going into the city to secure an item for his employer, and warns Spidey that if he tries to stop him, then Juggernaut fully intends to do as much damage to the city as he could. Spider-Man agrees to step aside and let him proceed, and when called out on it replies that he isn't nowhere near strong enough to fight someone like Juggernaut, and he isn't willing to risk the lives of innocent people out of pride.
</li><li> As their name suggests, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a> frequently follow this principle.

Megatron calmly tells them to stand down, or he will kill all of them. The four immediately lower their weapons. The threat was not hollow, as even the empowered Starscream can't stand up to Megatron.
</li><li> Simply having the presence of mind to recognize when to back down is considered a strength among many Micromasters in <em>Transformers Generation One</em>; Swindler of the Race Car patrol knows when he's beat. Detour of the Sports Car patrol is a bit of a coward, but can tell when the other shoe's about to drop, too.

</li><li> Duckburg's normal criminals know better than to fight or run when Paperinik catches them.

Far too often there will be contestants that will keep turning down offers and keep playing, even if they knock off every big prize amount on the board. This is a common fallacy (called the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SunkCostFallacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SunkCostFallacy">Sunk Cost Fallacy</a>) in that people believe if they already gone this far, they might as well keep going to the end and try to get the big prize no matter how much they have lost.

Contestants have to keep playing if they want to win a bigger cash prize, but getting a question wrong will end the game and reduce their winnings to the last threshold they passed, which can be a <em>lot</em> of money lost if the contestant advanced very far. Many contestants that were in a tight spot knew the risks were too high and simply ended the game early to keep what they won.

Four hundred years before the events of the books Halla's people's lands were invaded by wyverns, first in secret, then in open warfare. When it becomes clear that the wyverns are too dangerous to continue fighting (they have poisonous stings and what amounts to armor under the skin), Halla orders the unicorns to withdraw and leave their lands to the wyverns until the time comes that the unicorns are capable of meeting them in more evenly matched combat. The main character of the Trilogy's been raised on her story all his life, but still can't quite stomach the part of the legend where Halla orders the retreat for the sake of survival.

</li><li> A mark of a good officer in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> series is knowing when it's best to do this.

<ul><li> A specific instance occurs in <em>Echoes of Honor.</em> A surprise Havenite attack catches the less than competent Rear Admiral Elvis Santino completely flat-footed. His operations officer, Andrea Jaruwalski, tries to get him to fold, surrendering the system they don't need in the face of a vastly superior force. Santino responds by relieving Jaruwalski of her position and sending her away with enough of a black spot on her record to sabotage her career, then calling up his command to meet the Havenite attack. Santino's command is mostly destroyed while Jaruwalski eventually has her career salvaged with the help of Honor Harrington herself.

The main character of "Bitten", the first book, spends her character development deciding which of her conflicting desires to pursue and which to abandon. In later books, the trope is more subtle, but still reoccurs often.

Turns out it was too good to be true: the Parkers were not afraid of going to jail because Ma Parker had been slowly infiltrating the penitentiary with criminals disguised as guards until Warden Crichton had been the only non-corrupt person left - and Ma then had the "guards" turn on Crichton and bully him into making <em>her</em> the new warden. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonousCaptive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonousCaptive">The Parkers gain total control of the prison</a>, "breaking out" as often as they wish to commit robberies.

<ul><li> Practically a catchphrase of Commander Adama. In the miniseries pilot Roslin convinces Adama that retaking The Colonies is hopeless, and their best hope is to escort humanity's survivors somewhere safe from the Cylons. In <em>You Can't Go Home Again</em>, Adama is forced to concede that the search and rescue mission for Starbuck is hopeless. And in <em>Lay Down Your Burdens</em> Lee makes the point that 2 ships with skeleton crews cannot hope to hold off a Cylon invasion fleet, so their best chance is to escape with what they can at the moment and come back when they have a clear plan and better odds.
</li><li> The reason Tom Zarek was such a thorn in Roslin &amp; Adama's side for all four seasons, is that he recognized when he shouldn't overextend himself, and was simply smart enough to quit while he was relatively ahead. For example he wanted to assassinate Roslin outside the Tomb of Athena, but once Commander Adama and his men showed up he realized it was too risky and simply dropped the plan. One of Zarek's goons even urges that they go through with it anyway, but Zarek cites this trope...the goon tries on his own initiative, and gets killed.

Commander Cain (Lloyd Bridges) is in command of the other surviving Battlestar, the <em>Pegasus</em>, and wants to launch an offensive. Cain is brilliant, but wrong; as Adama (Lorne Greene) points out, two Battlestars, encumbered by a refugee fleet that is essentially defenseless and that houses the last survivors of their people, can't win a war against the Cylon Empire. They must run or die, and Cain eventually realizes that Adama is right.

This proves unpopular with the public in England, and the government sends intelligence agents to scout the possibility of retaking the island. The de facto mayor is forced to argue against the liberation of his island, pointing out that it would be a hopeless waste of British lives and end in a harsher German occupation, and counsels the spies (one of whom is his own son) to give themselves up as POWs.

He assumes he caused the crash, panics, and ends up being followed by the police. The B-plot consists of Francis coming up with increasingly paper-thin excuses to get himself out of trouble. When Reese calls Francis for advice, Francis at first encourages him to keep looking for a way out - then, as everyone he's lied to marches into the room, he admits that sometimes the best you can do is end things "with class".

In fact, one source says that their fortresses always have a few "fake escape routes" along with the real ones.

When faced with a losing battle, either side can offer a concession, meaning they still lose the fight, and therefore suffer some kind of setback, but they choose how and lose on their terms. This is handy for player and GM alike, to keep characters alive — perhaps the heroic wizard simply gets knocked for a loop while the villainous sorcerer makes off with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>, rather than risking the next attack which will probably kill the wizard instead.

Unfortunately, that's not the kind of thinking encouraged by the Dark Gods/the Warboss/the Commissariat, and in fact doing the smart thing like pulling back in front of superior numbers only gets you eaten by daemons/krumped flat/in front of a firing squad. However, a number of factions are noted to make regular use of this strategy.
<ul><li> The most successful Ork warbosses are from the Blood Axes clan, who are viewed as cowardly gits by other Orks for their tendency to retreat when the odds are against them; the Axes themselves just say fleeing means you can fight again next time, so it doesn't count as losing.
</li><li> The Tau tend to see everything in terms of cost/benefit analysis for their civilization as a whole, and will readily retreat and give ground when they judge a fight's cost to not be worth its potential gains. For instance, they may concede entire frontier worlds to Imperial advances, reasoning that, if the humans are willing to enter expensive meatgrinder wars for a few strategically worthless balls of mud, then they're welcome to keep them, and the the Tau can send their resources to deal with more important matters until the Imperium's watch eventually slackens and the Tau can come back and claim their old objectives for a much smaller cost. To the Imperium, who bitterly holds onto even the most unproductive human worlds to the last as a matter of honor, this philosophy comes across as extremely perplexing.
</li><li> The Eldar and Dark Eldar, who have very low number and very low birth rates compared to everyone else, cannot absorb much in the way of casualties. Consequently, they will retreat from battles that start to go against them, as few objectives are worth enough to them to justify losing even more of their already dwindling numbers in fights they seem increasingly unlikely to win anyway.

They'll take some stress, but they'll survive, and if the run was going badly they were probably going to need some quality time in the temple or the tavern anyway.
</li><li> At the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>, the heroes make a battle plan where King Cailan will lure the Darkspawn into a trap, you and Alistair will light a signal fire, and Teryn Loghain will outflank the Darkspawn. However, when you actually light the fire, Loghain abandons you. It's heavily debated both in-universe and out whether this trope was legitimately in play (the front line was already breaking down and it was too late to save Cailan) or whether it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetrayalByInaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetrayalByInaction">Betrayal by Inaction</a>.

There are multiple cards that can get you an advantage should you lose the round:
<ul><li> Ciri is not very impressive by herself, having 4 strength while taking up a large amount of precious deckbuilding provisions. However, should you lose the round in which you played her, she returns to your hand instead of going to the graveyard. 4 strength might not be much, but the value she poses as an additional card to play makes her ability powerful.

When Kastore makes his move, Archibald gets out and so can continue to scheme in safety, unlike the last time.
<ul><li> AI opponents generally know when they're outmatched, and will not initiate battle against a hero with a superior army under most circumstances. If challenged, they will often fire off their strongest spell and retreat once they know they are outmatched (surrender, however, does not seem to be an option the AI players are able to use). The only exception to the first rule is when they are down to their last town, in which case they will be eliminated from the game unless they capture another within seven days.

Steven and his dad build a "spaceship" together (really a soapbox racer), and his dad warns Steven that he shouldn't be afraid to bail out if something's going wrong. Sure enough, the soapbox racer crashes but Steven is spared injury by jumping clear. Later, Pearl gets it into her head to build an actual, functioning spaceship out of scrap and takes Steven on its maiden voyage. Pearl is desperate to return to space after centuries of being stuck on Earth, to the point of refusing to bail out even as the spaceship disintegrates around them both, and it takes Steven to convince her to eject mere seconds before her ship explodes.

Raphael really doesn't like running from a fight, so Leonardo tells him it's a "tactical retreat".

He's made no secret his desire to obtain Cybertronian tech for his own ends. However, if it looks as if the tide of battle is turning against him, he has no problem ordering a strategic withdrawal, happy to use what information he's gleaned for the next encounter. It's notable that Optimus Prime compares him to Megatron.

Tecna sees this and calls him a coward for not fighting.
