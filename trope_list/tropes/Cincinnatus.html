The evil cat boss, spying on the meeting of mice leaders, heard the reference and thought that Cincinnatus was a new secret agent (in Hungarian, "Cincin" is the onomatopoeia for the sound mice make), so he sent his assistant, Safranek, to look him up. This led to Safranek being tortured, as he unwisely told his boss that Cincinnatus was a historical figure, which is common knowledge.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> This was part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Senator Palpatine's</a> plan to ascend to full on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a> status. By manufacturing a conflict around Naboo and stymieing Chancellor Valorum's ability to do anything about it, he was able to push Queen Amidala into the no-confidence vote that put him, as the most capable emergency ruler, into the top spot. Around this time (it's unclear whether it was before or after the Naboo blockade) he arranged for the creation of a Grand Army and simultaneously used the fallout from the failed blockade to stir Separatist agendas. Pushing both of these together resulted in the Clone Wars, a galactic incident which required continued stable and capable leadership. Having upheld this trope to the Senate, emergency powers were granted, until eventually he was able to wipe out the one threat to his rule, the Jedi Order. Then came <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>, and STILL he was treated as this trope!
</li><li> Meanwhile, the Jedi while ruling their own, tend to act as advisors rather than rule themselves. When they start to grow wary of Palpatine, Ki-Adi-Mundi suggests removing him from office. Mace points out that the Jedi would have to take control of the Republic to ensure peace. Yoda is clearly <em>not</em> happy about the situation. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Legends</a>, they had to do this when a previous Chancellor grew too corrupt.

At the end of the Targaryen civil war known as "The Dance of the Dragons" Cregan arrived in King's Landing just after Aegon II had been poisoned, meaning the throne passed to their nephew Aegon III, son of the claimant Cregan had been supporting. Cregan was named Hand by Aegon III and responded by punishing those responsible for Aegon II's death, feeling a King's murder must be punished even if it was a tyrant he was fighting against. Cregan's actions enabled a relatively stable reign for Aegon III, though the day after finishing the trials Cregan resigned the Handship and returned to the North, having been granted many rewards, and in exchange for pardoning Lord Corlys Velaryon he married Alysanne Blackwood.

The Migrant Fleet technically exists under a state of emergency martial law (as it has been for centuries) but in practice most decisions are handled by an elected civilian council, both on the level of individual ships and on the level of entire sectors of the fleet in a federal-type government known as the Conclave. However, the Admiralty can invoke a deliberate override of anything the Conclave chooses as an exercise of emergency powers, but are required to resign from their positions immediately after the emergency has passed, or face arrest and prosecution if they refuse to do so. This helps keep the otherwise unrestricted exercise of power in check. So far, the Admiralty override has only been invoked four times in the three centuries of the fleet's existence.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder11');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder11" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Roman history:
<ul><li> Named for Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, a legendary Roman general, who, sometime after he retired to his farm, was given total power in Rome to fight off an invasion. Cincinnatus' status as a <em>dictator</em> afforded him six months of total power over Rome by Roman law. His fame comes from the fact that he repulsed the invasion and conquered the invaders in <em>sixteen days</em>, then handed power right back to Rome even though he was legally entitled to continue ruling for the rest of his "term" as <em>dictator</em>. The city of Cincinnati in the USA's state of Ohio is partly named for him, and then there's the Society of the Cincinnati (see below). A year later, Cincinnatus was appointed dictator for a second time, due to an alleged plot by Spurius Maelius to seize power and name himself king. This term was even shorter, as Maelius refused to answer a summons from Cincinnatus to defend himself against the allegations, and was killed by Roman soldiers. Cincinnatus immediately resigned and went back to his farm. There was an added reason for why this became so remarkable: when Cincinnatus took up the dictatorship, the Roman Republic was only fifty years old and many in the Senate did not remember the revolt against Tarquin. That a Roman citizen could be invested with such power and then willingly give it up demonstrated the durability of the principles and revolutionary spirit of the Republic's founding.
<ul><li> Cincinnatus set a precedent, in that all <em>dictatores</em> were expected to give back their power to the Senate as soon as they completed the task they had been appointed to fulfill. Most did just that, with the few exceptions being detailed below and having good reasons for it.
</li></ul></li><li> Exploited by Augustus, who made sure to abstain from all the flashy titles, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTheFirstCitizen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTheFirstCitizen">keeping the less impressive-sounding ones</a> (and all the power that came with them). For most of the time, Augustus's strategy was to get the Roman Senate to grant him new titles such as <em>tribunicia potestas</em>, since he was governor of lots of frontier provinces and therefore <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionMookMarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionMookMarch">loads and loads of legions</a>, since most of the Roman Army was in the outer provinces. One of the ways he ensured his power was to use his legions to threaten the Senate to give him governorship of even more provinces, so that he'd get control of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">even more legions</a>.
</li><li> The Roman emperor Diocletian was born to a lower-class family and worked his way upward to the Imperium. He brought a fifty-year round of civil war to an end and stabilized the economy, giving the Roman Empire a new lease on life. He set up an elaborate system of co-emperors to prevent a return to civil war and, when the time came, voluntarily retired. When his political order started to collapse, he was begged to retake the throne. His response was, "If you could show the cabbage that I planted with my own hands to your emperor, he definitely wouldn't dare suggest that I replace the peace and happiness of this place with the storms of a never-satisfied greed."
</li><li> Lucius Cornelius Sulla (or Sylla), who became <em>dictator</em> after two civil wars and was, for many decades, reviled by Roman memory as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">the epitome of a tyrant</a>. He ordered many political purges and made several reforms in order to re-establish the aristocratic supremacy in the republic, then retired from political life, and died two years later. Sulla inspired much of the bloody tension between the <em>optimates</em> and the <em>populares</em> (essentially, the right wing and the left wing) which led to lots of brutal civil wars, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">he died peacefully in his bed on a pretty farm.</a>
</li><li> According to some historians, Julius Caesar actually would have fit this trope if he had lived. There are sources stating that he was in the process of returning full power to the senate when he was murdered. Though the documents that this theory is based on cannot be proven genuine or fake, so at least at this point it's anyone's guess whether it's true.
</li><li> Scipio Africanus. While he never actually had absolute power, it is arguable that he could havehe was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass">Four-Star Badass</a> who actually defeated Hannibal and ended the Second Punic War, thus gaining more prestige then any Roman had ever had. Instead of attempting to take power, he retired to his villa to get away from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Obstructive Bureaucrats</a> of the Senate.
</li><li> Fittingly, Scipio's main political opponent (and the guy who kept Hannibal at bay until Scipio defeated him) Fabius: he was bestowed the title of <em>dictator</em> and used it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">launch a guerrilla campaign</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringYetPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringYetPractical">that, in spite of being unpopular, kept Hannibal's army in check and at one point came close to destroying it</a>. When his term expired and the Senate refused to renew it, he dutifully left. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour">after Cannae</a>, he resumed the campaign and set things up so that Hannibal would be unable to march on Rome while slowly losing his support. He was never reappointed <em>dictator</em>, but he didn't need it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PompeyTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PompeyTheGreat">Pompey the Great</a>: to deal with the deadly threat of piracy in the Mediterranean he was given powers arguably <em>greater</em> than those of a <em>dictator</em> (absolute control over the sea and inland to up to fifty miles-thus including Rome itself and most of their lands), ability to draw as much as he wanted for the treasury of Rome and its allies, twenty four lieutenants, and an <em>initial</em> force of 500 ships, 120,000 infantry and 5,000 cavalry with ability to raise more, for a period of three years. Plus, of course, impunity for anything he did during the job). In 89 days most pirates were dead or had surrendered <em>and</em> had forced Armenia (whose king Tigranes the Great had been supporting the pirates) into submitting to Rome, and then dutifully remitted his powers to the Senate.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePresidents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePresidents">The Presidents</a> of the United States of America:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington">George Washington</a>, the first president, was unanimously elected to two four-year terms. Even though there was no law at the time limiting presidents to only two terms in office, he declined to run for election again (thereby establishing a custom that survived attempts at [non-consecutive] third terms by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UlyssesSGrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UlyssesSGrant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> and wasn't actually broken until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>). He could have served even longer, but is considered a modern Cincinnatus for not doing so. Cincinnati is partly named in his honor also. Washington pulled this off once prior when he resigned his commission in the army and went back to private life for <em>years</em> before becoming president. On hearing that Washington planned to invoke this trope, King George III said, "If he does that, he will be the greatest man in the world."
</li><li> President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesKPolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesKPolk">James K. Polk</a> lived before the two-term limit was imposed, but he didn't run for a second term in 1848, saying that there was no need as he'd already accomplished everything he wanted to in his first term (so much the better; he died three months after leaving office). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RutherfordBHayes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RutherfordBHayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a> also declined to run for a second term in 1880, keeping a promise he'd made shortly after being elected in highly suspicious circumstances (he won by <em>one</em> electoral vote, with three states' electoral vote allocations being heavily disputed, and had lost the popular vote). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CalvinCoolidge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CalvinCoolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a> also declined to run again in 1928 despite having served for just under six years as President (similarly to Johnson, except that Coolidge had no term limits). All other one-term presidents (besides those who died in their first term) ran for a second term and either lost the election or were passed over by their party.
</li><li> The city of Cincinnati, Ohio is specifically named after the Order of the Cincinnati, a military veterans' organization of which George Washington was a founding member. Many critics of the organization consider it ironic that despite ostensibly honoring the retirement of officers into private pursuits, the organization itself amassed a great deal of power after the Revolution and became the closest thing the country had to a landed gentry.
</li><li> Many books written about US Presidents stretching the line feature military personnel discussing the Oath of Cincinnatus and the implications of the military betraying their oaths to defend the Constitution, rather than the government.
</li><li> Washington's officers after the revolution offered to start a coup d'état to destroy the <em>incredibly</em> inefficient and ineffective government of the Articles of Confederation and install him as King of America in the Newburgh Conspiracy, due mostly to not being paid for years in spite of Congressional promises to do so.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note40u9w');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note40u9w" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note40u9w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Due to the terms of the Articles, the Federal government had <em>very</em> little power, and couldn't compel the State governments to chip in to pay the Continental Army.</span> Washington's answer was to the effect of "Do you think I expelled George III so that I could become George I?"
<ul><li> George Washington popped up unannounced in the middle of the conspiracy. Sources say that it wasn't his speech that actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamingTheMob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamingTheMob">broke the mutiny</a>, but his putting on reading glasses for the first time in public, with the words, "Gentlemen, you will permit me to put on my spectacles, for I have not only grown gray but almost blind in the service of my country." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears">It's said there wasn't a dry eye left in the room.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> It's easy to forget due to the long line of historians with Southern sympathies smearing his presidency (which is currently reevaluated by historians as decent and even great in fields like race relations), but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UlyssesSGrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UlyssesSGrant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPolynomial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPolynomial">Popularity Polynomial</a> going on during his own lifetime. He was immensely popular from emerging as a commander in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a> to the end of his first term (his 1872 bid for reelection succeeded with only token opposition), but suffered greatly due to the economic downturn and increasingly-hard-to-ignore corruption of other executive branch members during his second term. Out of office, he regained the favor of many Americans and wanted to give a third term a try, but the Republican Party bigwigs flatly refused, citing the example of Washington. There being no meaningful democratic primaries, that was that.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OliverCromwell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OliverCromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorProvincialism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorProvincialism">pulled this more than a hundred years before any American</a> during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar">English Civil War</a>. He also refused to become king after leading the Parliamentarians to victory (and the execution of King Charles I) and being outright offered the crown. Much like (and likely more so than) Washington, it's uncertain how much of his borderline-saintly reputation is historical fact and how much was propaganda. He subverted this trope in his last years ruling the Commonwealth of England (the nominally republican regime that ruled the British Isles) as its "Lord Protector" (read: king in all but name) until his death. That being said, Cromwell seems to have been genuinely conflicted about this and hoped to establish a real republic; it's just that the various political factions in England were constantly at odds and basically could never agree on anything except that they liked Cromwell.
</li><li> Juan Carlos I of Spain. Handpicked by the infamous dictator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranciscoFranco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranciscoFranco">Francisco Franco</a> to succeed him. During Franco's rule, he seemed to be a loyal supporter and destined to continue Franco's policies. All the insiders believed it would be business as usual after Franco was dead. Once Franco was in the ground and Juan had become King of Spain and received the absolute power of his predecessor, he voluntarily used that power to turn Spain into a constitutional monarchy with a Westminster-style Parliament, knowingly and willingly reducing himself to a figurehead in the process. And <em>then</em>, he personally browbeat into submission the officers who attempted a coup to return to the good old Franco days. He was almost universally popular throughout much of his reign, but he ultimately stepped down in 2014 mostly due to age, but also because some people were outraged that he had gone big-game hunting — pretty much the first "scandal" of his entire reign.
<ul><li> Franco can also be counted as this. While he ruled Spain as dictator after the war until his death, rather than continuing the dictatorship afterwards he willingly gave the reins of power back to the monarchy.
</li></ul></li><li> When Venezuelan dictator Juan Vicente Gómez chose his War Minister Eleazar López Contreras as his successor, people expected him to continue managing the country as his personal farm. Instead, he made a deep social reform, shortening the presidential term from seven years to five and served only three or four years of it, quitting and abandoning politics altogether.
</li><li> Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (lit. "Father of Turks") was an officer in the Turkish military who parlayed his victories against Allied forces (especially at Gallipoli) and during the course of Turkey's post-war border clashes with The Etente (chiefly France, but also Britain) and her somewhat ruthless no-holds-barred war with Greece (which involved cheery ethnic cleansing like that seen in Smyrna) he became Turkey's Generalissimo. After the wars were concluded he made the country semi-democratic, making himself the first Prime Minister and first Speaker of Parliament - but he gave up those titles in just a few years. Though he remained President (a ceremonial role) for the rest of his life, his role in politics limited to a sort of 'oversight' function (to root out unconstitutional or corrupt politicians) that the Turkish Military continues to oversee to this day in the spirit of 'Kemalism'. The military has executed five coups to this end (1960, '71, '81,'97, and the failed 2016 coup), but they've always handed all power back to democratically-elected representatives within a few years and the idea of the military actually running the country would be unthinkable. Turkish votes very nearly made Atatürk the "Man of the Century" in a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.time.com/time/time100/time100poll.html">Time poll<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for the same title.
<ul><li> It's also interesting to note that the cult of personality around Atatürk didn't really manifest until <em>after</em> his death. He certainly wanted to be admired and for Turkey to follow his example, but there's no indication that he wanted the quasi-religious level of worship that Kemalism has turned into. On the other hand, when Atatürk made a law requiring every Turk to get a Western style surname, he could not resist the temptation of taking "Atatürk" — father of all Turks. Turkish surnames are mostly immodest, though — "Özdemir" for example means "pure iron".
</li></ul></li><li> When you think about it, a revealing definition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRepublic">The Republic</a> might simply be "A society organized for the purpose of reliably mass-producing enough Cincinnati."
</li><li> The Duke of Zhou is celebrated as a figure of "proper authority" in Chinese mythology as he served as regent for his nephew, Cheng Wang the King of Zhou, until Cheng Wang came of age and peacefully transferred authority to his nephew.
</li><li> In 1976 Nigerian Military Head of State Gen. Murtala Muhammed was killed in a failed coup attempt, and his deputy, Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo succeeded him. Obasanjo continued his predecessor's plan to return power to the civilians, and had a constitution drawn up. In 1979, he presided over general elections, and handed over the government to the winners, becoming a national hero and symbol of patriotism and duty. In 1999, after another military dictator had died in office and another transition was taking place, there was public clamor for "OBJ" to run for president (he had in fact been jailed by the previous regime, only being released upon Gen. Abacha's death). He won the vote, and reelection four years later, then it all got to his head and he subverted his own Cincinnatus status by trying to change the constitution to allow himself a third term. The senate checkmated him, and he left office one of the most unpopular men in the country.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Tecumseh_Sherman">General William T. Sherman<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was a successful Union general during the American Civil War. After Sherman took Atlanta, he became the Union's new darling and the sentiment led to an offer to promote him to the same rank as General Grant. He replied with, "I will accept no commission that would tend to create a rivalry with Grant. I want him to hold what he has earned and got. I have all the rank I want."After retiring from the military, he was approached about the possibility of seeking the presidency, to which he replied, "If drafted, I will not run; if nominated, I will not accept; if elected, I will not serve." To this day, a categorical and absolute refusal to seek a certain office is referred to as a "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shermanesque_statement">Shermanesque statement<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>".
</li><li> In 1940, faced with imminent defeat, the French Assembly voted to give full powers to Maréchal Philippe Pétain, the WWI hero. Yeah, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs">that turned out well</a>. The only thing they managed to accomplish was to permanently ruin the reputation of a once-great man who by the time of his appointment was already in the early stages of senility. This, combined with his advanced age and his previous service to his country is the only reason why they didn't hang him with the rest of the senior collaborators in the French government once the war was over.
</li><li> It didn't work out any better for Germany when they elected their own WWI hero, Paul von Hindenburg, to the then very powerful office of President. He did an all right job but got drawn into party policies after the extremists blocked the parliament. He also wasn't particularly fond of participating in a democracy<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note54ml4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note54ml4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note54ml4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He was a monarchist, but did not try to re-introduce the monarchy, as he felt bound by his oath on the constitution.</span> and wanted to retire after his term was over.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6l6bc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6l6bc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6l6bc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He was <strike>begged</strike> convinced to run for a second term by an array of all parties except Nazis and communists, i.e. from the socialists to the monarchists, in order to prevent a certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> from being elected president.</span> The former led to him being manipulated (by the even less competent Franz von Papen) into appointing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> as Chancellor,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7alpn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7alpn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7alpn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He was made to believe that the setup of ministers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">would prevent Hitler from taking over.</a></span> the latter to Hitler being able to seize total power by combining the offices of President and Chancellor into that of "Führer" when Hindenburg died.
</li><li> In the last days of World War II, when the last defenses of Berlin were collapsing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow">Hitler appointed Admiral Karl Dönitz as the next head of state</a>, who was one of the few remaining high-ranking officers who still had his trust and who was still relatively safe in his faraway naval base in Northern Germany, where Allied troops had not arrived yet. When Goebbels killed himself a day after Hitler, Dönitz was effectively the only remainder of a German political leadership and took it on himself to form a new government. Accepting that the war was lost, he spent the following days withdrawing the remaining troops to the west and surrendering to the Americans and British, to be safe from the Soviets and to coordinate a fast and orderly surrender. However he let the surrender be stalled to allow more refugees and dispersed units to escape the Red Army to territory under the control of the Western Allies. By his own claims, the night Hitler's right hand Himmler (who was the leader of the SS units and had tried to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuisling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuisling">make a deal with the British on his own</a>) visited him to talk about the future leadership of Germany was the only time he had a loaded gun in an open drawer of his desk, but fortunately Himmler accepted that he would not be the new leader and also would not get any position of power under Dönitz and gave up on his designs to become the head of postwar Germany without a fight.
</li><li> The Marquis de Lafayette — helped win the American Revolutionary war, first disarmed the nobles during the (first) French Revolution, then was imprisoned, denounced Napoleon, turned down becoming the governor of the Louisiana territory, helped the revolution of 1830, turned down the title of dictator to bring a more moderate king to the throne. Fittingly, he too was a founding member of Cincinnati.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoléon Bonaparte</a> was originally supposed to be this, then subverted — he led a coup against the horribly inefficient semi-democratic government in 1799, then stepped back a little to have a new constitution for France drawn up. According to the Constitution of the Year VII, which was approved in an overwhelming referendum, he became First Consul of France, essentially dictator. However, he was still fully expected to step down — and, at this point, perhaps even intended to, though his term was all of ten years, more than enough time. Two years later, however, another referendum and the Constitution of the Year X made Napoleon Consul for Life as recognition for restoring order to France and ending the Revolutionary Wars. Since he pretty much had all the power he could wish for at this point, he wasn't all too keen on becoming hereditary Emperor of the French in 1804.
</li><li> A Hunanese official, Zeng Guofan, raised a massive army from his home province that was completely loyal to him to crush the Taiping Rebellion. By the end of the war, the Qing Dynasty had almost no military force left, and had relied entirely on Zeng Guofan and the foreign-led Ever Victorious Army to fight the rebels; as the Qing were seen as outsiders by the Han Chinese, Zeng Guofan's brothers advised him to march north to Beijing, expel the Qing, and declare himself emperor. Horribly traumatized by the bloodiest civil war in history, Zeng Guofan declined, disbanded his army of 120,000, and for a century thereafter his fellow Han Chinese saw him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CategoryTraitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CategoryTraitor">Category Traitor</a>, although both the Republican and communist governments later praised Guofan as a hero.
