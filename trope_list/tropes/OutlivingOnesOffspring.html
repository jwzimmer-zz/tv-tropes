At this point, the parents can fall into a deep depression or seek <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">Revenge</a> on whoever caused this situation. If they are lucky, they will have their spouse to help them through this situation but often they will be all alone to deal with their grief.

This can happen if someone dies an unnatural death (such as in an accident or due to disease) or if a parent lives particularly long (it's quite common for people over 100 to have outlived at least one of the parents children) and far too frequently during times of war when the offspring is old enough to fight and in earlier historical periods when death at early or middle age was more common than it was today, those who lived to advanced age (their 80s or 90s) were likely to have outlived some of their children or even grandchildren. However, unlike in fiction, in real life, it is accepted as a fact of life, no matter how depressing the situation is.

</li><li> Due to the nature of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>, several parents end up outliving their children.
<ul><li> Armin's grandfather outlived his son and daughter-in-law <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> hinted to be the couple in the hot balloon killed by the government</span>, raising his young grandson.
</li><li> After the massacre of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the royal family</span>, Rod Reiss only had one illegitimate daughter left, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Historia</span>, after the deaths of his three other daughters and two sons.
</li><li> Petra is survived by her father.
</li><li> Mr. and Mrs. Yeager, the parents to Grisha and the grandparents to Eren. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Their daughter was killed at a young age in a violent fashion and later they could only helplessly watch as Grisha was sentenced to be Titanized due to treason, effectively a death sentence.</span>
<ul><li> At this point in time, they may also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">outlive both of their grandsons, Eren and Zeke.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Also happened to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sasha's parents, as Sasha was killed during the Liberio battle</span>.
</li><li> This is true for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">several parents whose children become titan shifters, as a shifter will die 13 years after inheriting their titan powers. Examples include Bertolt's father (who apparently died in his sleep sometime after Reiner returned home, although this may be a government coverup), Marcel Galliard's parents (who will probably have the same thing happen with their younger son Porco)... Some of the current titan shifters' parents may also fall victim to this trope (including Reiner's) but it remains to be seen.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano">Bokurano</a></em>
<ul><li> Almost all of the pilots' parents end up having this happen to them- the only exceptions are those who die before their children(Kodama's father, Ushiro's mother and Komo's father in the anime). In the manga, Kana's father takes the news of her being the next pilot (essentially a death sentence) especially hard and even asks if he can take Kana's place.
</li><li> Also from the manga, Komo's opponent is a middle-aged man whose daughter was killed by the families of those who'd died in previous battles. His daughter's death sends him over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a> and is implied to be why he doesn't want to win his battle.
</li><li> In Kanji's arc of the manga, some of the soldiers who volunteer for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideMission">Suicide Mission</a> to help him target Javelin's weak point have lost family in the attacks. As one older soldier talks about how he's been forced to confront the reality of losing loved ones, a panel shows a family portrait cracked and buried under rubble, implying that he lost his children.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Clannad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Clannad">CLANNAD</a></em>:

</li><li> Played straight by Nagisa's parents, who hold back on their grief to raise Ushio. In fact, a very poignant <em>After Story</em> scene takes place as Sanae talks to Tomoya about it and breaks down crying.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>:

Easily one of the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">saddest moments</a>, especially considering that said mother had been widowed a year earlier.
</li><li> Apparently, one of the women sitting close to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Prince Clovis</span>'s casket during his funeral is his mother, Lady Gabrielle.
</li></ul></li><li> Many, <em>many</em> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticMurderer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticMurderer">sympathetic murderers</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> are mothers and fathers who kill the persons who directly or indirectly caused the death of their children.

Light's father Soichiro also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparedByTheAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparedByTheAdaptation">outlives his son</a> in the live-action films and musical. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The trade-off is that he <em>knows</em> his son is Kira, though.</span>

He feels guilt-stricken about this and can't believe he committed suicide.
</li><li> The amnesiac protagonist of the series, Chiyuki, killed herself after she could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury">no longer ice-skate due to a knee fracture</a>. In the final episode, she visits her mother, who is mourning Chiyuki's death three months later. Overcome by her mother's tears, Chiyuki breaks down and regrets her decision, which causes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic">Decim</a> to cry. It turns out the whole scene was an illusion created by him to help judge her soul and he feels bad about lying to her.
</li></ul></li><li> Two cases in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em>: Iori/Cody's father Hiroki was killed in London, survived by his father Chikara, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Ken</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">Ichijoji</a>'s older brother Osamu/Sam was killed in a car accident, survived by their parents.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, Vegeta winds up losing his son, Trunks, <em>twice</em>. First, after Trunks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">from the future</a> was murdered by Cell, and second when Kid Buu destroyed the Earth (taking Goten, Gohan, and Piccolo with it, additionally effecting Goku since the former two are <em>his</em> sons). It hits harder watching this happen to Vegeta since we see his genuine response in witnessing Trunks' death both times—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">going ballistic</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">futilely attacking Cell despite him being much stronger than Vegeta</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">chewing out Goku for opting to save Hercule and Dende over their children instead</a>. Though to be fair, Vegeta was dead himself when the younger Trunks died. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">And he'd already died once before Trunks had even been conceived</a>.
</li><li> The twist in the short manga <em>Forever Honey</em> is that the daughter had been killed in a car crash and what the reader had been seeing was her ghost.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> this happens to a few people:
<ul><li> Pinako Rockbell's only son and daughter-in-law, Yuriy and Sara, were killed during the Ishvalan conflict, leaving her to raise her granddaughter Winry alone.
</li><li> Sig and Izumi Curtis lost their only child at his birth. That led a desperate Izumi to break the taboo and try the forbidden human transmutation, contrasting with the Elrics who did the same thing to recreate their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">Missing Mom</a> (and in fact, she empathizes strongly with them <em>because</em> of that). In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">2003 anime</a> this child becomes Wrath.
</li><li> General Grumman outlived his daughter, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Riza Hawkeye</span>'s unnamed mother, although this relationship is confirmed only in the supplemental material.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">the 2003 anime</a> Envy was created when Hohenheim and Dante tried to revive their son.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GakuenBabysitters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GakuenBabysitters">Gakuen Babysitters</a></em>: The chairwoman loses her son in the same plane crash as the Kashima brothers lost their parents.

Sometime during the Middle Ages, the immortal druid Atticus O'Sullivan settled down in Africa, married and had children. He managed to avert this trope by providing his wife and children with a limited version of his own immortality. His children and their children became the immortal elite of a new nation. However, after a few centuries, his wife died in a way that his magic could not prevent and he decided that it was a time to move on. He was sorry that his children would die but as a druid, he felt that he has subverted nature for too long and that his descendants started to abuse their immortality. It is implied that most of the older generations of his descendants killed themselves rather than face old age.

This was the original reason why the elves built Kharumba, a city whose inhabitants also become ageless regardless of their species, in an effort to avert this trope.

Part of the reason he agrees to the ridiculous-sounding premise of buying the throne of a fantasy realm is that he really doesn't care what happens to him anymore. Later in the series, he and his second wife Willow have a daughter, and the prospect of experiencing this trope a second time scares him half to death.

<ul><li> In 1979, Kings Island built The Beast, which was the longest wooden roller coaster in the world. In 2000, as part of an expansion of the new Action Zone, the park built Son of Beast, which was the world's first wooden hypercoaster and first wooden roller coaster with an inversion. It was the tallest and fastest wooden roller coaster in the world, and second-longest behind only its "father" coaster. Unfortunately, unlike the father Beast, the Son of Beast was plagued with design problems caused by subpar construction material, closed in 2009, and demolished in 2012 to be replaced with an inverted coaster known as Banshee, while the "father" Beast remains operating to this day.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII">Assassin's Creed II</a></em> Ezio's mother Maria goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbStruck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbStruck">mute</a> after witnessing the deaths of her husband and two of her sons and being abused by the city guards.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIVBlackFlag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIVBlackFlag">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</a></em>, Ah Tabai, the mentor of the West Indies Assassins, had only one son who died before the age of ten. Anne Bonny's child dies shortly after being born.
</li><li> Desmond's death in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIII">Assassin's Creed III</a></em> sends William Miles into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> and causes him to leave the Assassin Order.
</li><li> One of Altaïr's sons were executed when Altaïr's rival seized control of the Assassins while Altaïr was away. To make things worse, the guy who killed him taunted Altaïr when he revealed that he lied to Altaïr's son that he was being executed on <em>Altaïr's orders</em>. And then framed Altaïr's best friend Malik as the one who ordered Sef's execution before eventually killing him as well. Upon learning that his son died believing Altaïr had betrayed him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf">Altaïr</a> immediately uses the Apple to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> the executioner—which leads directly to the death of Altaïr's wife, too. Well, it was actually the executioner being a sadistic SOB that leads to Maria's death. Maria stopped Altaïr from killing the executioner. So, "in gratitude", the executioner stabs Maria <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBack">In the Back</a>, so, naturally, Altaïr returns the favor and kills the guy.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedOrigins">Assassin's Creed Origins</a></em>, Bayek is forced by The Order to run his son through with a knife. Later in the game, the daughter of two of Bayek's associates is drowned by members of the Order looking for information.

The <em>Reaper's Due</em> DLC added a series of events specifically for parents with dead children, which can range in responses based on the importance of the child in the line of succession and how well-liked they were by the character.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>, this happens to Fergus Cousland, the older brother of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleGameOpenings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleGameOpenings">Human Noble Warden</a>; his wife and young son are slain during Arl Howe's coup in their origin. As Fergus has already left for Ostagar, his sibling is left with the sad duty of breaking the news to him, only to be prevented from doing so as he goes missing in action shortly before the battle. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Warden finally reunites with him at the end of the game, when Fergus is revealed to have survived the battle, but spent several months recuperating from his wounds. By that time, he's already heard about the massacre of his family, and is just grateful that his little brother/sister is still alive.</span>
<ul><li> Tragically, this even applies to Fergus and the Human Noble's parents, who only perish at the end of the prologue, meaning that they briefly outlive their own <em>grand</em>son. After discovering her grandson slain, Teyrna Eleanor Cousland's reaction is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisMeansWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisMeansWar">pick up a weapon</a> and proceed to get very, <em>very</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMessWithGranny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMessWithGranny">angry</a>.
</li><li> The City Elf Warden's father, Cyrion, or the Dwarf Commoner Warden's mother, Kalah, can also fall victim to this if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the PC chooses to perform the Ultimate Sacrifice</span>. Cyrion and Kalah are also implied to suffer this if the City Elf and the Dwarf Commoner are not selected as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>.
</li><li> Endrin, the Dwarf Noble Warden's father, outlives at least one of his three children. If the Dwarf Noble is not selected as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>, he outlives two of them. Either way, he dies of grief, or maybe poison, not long after.
</li><li> This is also a potential result of the Redcliffe quest arc; depending on player choices, Arl Eamon and Arlessa Isolde's son Connor may be killed rather than saved from demonic possession.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> starts with the Hawke family on the run from the first game's Blight. One of the twin siblings Bethany and Carver dies (which one depends on the main character's class), and their mother spends years recovering from it. If you take the surviving sibling into the Deep Roads without Anders, you'll have to break the news of <em>their</em> death to her as well.
<ul><li> This is a potential outcome of one early quest, as you can choose to murder the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> son of a local magistrate who does not take it well. You also have to kill Ser Thrask's possessed daughter shortly after meeting him, and the Viscount's son is murdered near the climax of Act 2.

<ul><li> This is also part of the backstory of the Orlesian civil war, which is happening during <em>Inquisition.</em> Judicael II outlived his twin sons and left the throne to his younger brother Florian, who outlived his baby daughter; all three children perished in a plague called the Hundred Days' Cough. This had a direct impact on the way the current ruler, Empress Celene, was able to take the throne.
</li><li> Also related to Celene taking the throne, party member Vivienne's lover Bastien was the father of Grand Duke Gaspard's wife Calienne, who was murdered at the beginning of Celene's reign.

<ul><li> In Morthal, the wife and daughter of a man named Hroggar perished in a fire. His neighbors are suspicious of him because he immediately hooked up with another woman named Alva and shows no apparent signs of grief over his loss. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hroggar is innocent. He is merely the charmed thrall of Alva, who is a vampire; she was the one who ordered another vampire to kill Hroggar's family.</span>
</li><li> Another Daedric quest is triggered by the funeral of a young girl in Falkreath, who was brutally murdered by a werewolf. In a weird case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">Mood Whiplash</a>, you can talk to her obviously grieving father about the situation, then sell vegetables to him; he speaks with all the cheerful tones of any other merchant. Once the transaction concludes, he goes back to grieving.
</li><li> You can orchestrate this during the Dark Brotherhood questline. Torbjorn and Tova Shatter-Shield are mourning the death of their daughter, Friga. If you murder their other daughter, Nilsine, at your client Muiri's request (they initially took her in as her family, but after she was swindled by a bandit they blamed her and rejected her; the contract calls for killing the bandit primarily, but she'll pay extra for Nilsine), Tova will commit suicide in grief over losing both her children. Even before you do anything, all the family members are mourning for Friga's loss.
</li><li> Sybille, the court mage in Solitude, was not the mother of the late King Torygg; however, she joined his father's court when he was very young and helped to raise him, so his murder hit her with an honorary form of this trope.

The concubines jockeyed with each other for power and status and eventually resorted to murdering each other and their children in the hopes of reaching the throne; by the end of it all, Garon outlived all of his biological children save four.

While the characters with that trait can still die a violent death, such as in combat or assassination, they can no longer experience natural death due to old age or illness. As a consequence, such a character can easily see the death of not only their children but also their grandchildren if not even more, provided of course that one of their vassals doesn't get suspicious of their liege's strange longevity and start asking inconvenient questions.

To prove his worth and make his father proud, Manos became a soldier, but this career path ended with him dying on a battlefield. His son's death drove Nua mad with grief, and he became obsessed with finding a way of calling his son's soul back from the aether and resurrecting it, turning into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">The Caligula</a> in the process, as he killed hundreds of his own subjects in horrific experiments to achieve this.

To make things even more painful, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the baby isn't actually her child.

Odin outlived his young son, Edie outlived all her children, all but one of her grandchildren, and most of her <em>great</em>-grandchildren, Sam outlived his sons Gus and Gregory, and Dawn definitely outlived her son Lewis and maybe her younger son Milton (he vanished one day and the case was never solved).

</li><li> Via the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeKingdomsShuWeiWu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeKingdomsShuWeiWu">Three Kingdoms history</a>, this is what most likely happened with Sun Quan's overall family after his parents' generation in real life (on top of having other close ones die on him aside from just his children), and most people who study up on that particular subject can easily assume that it was enough to drive him insane to make dumb decisions that effectively caused the infamous internal scuffle for the Wu throne.
</li><li> The Sanskrit language uses the word "vilomah" for parents who have lost their children. Translated to English, it literally means "against a natural order".

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">longest-reigning ever king in Europe</a>, he outlived not only all of his legitimate children but also <em>all but one of his legitimate grandchildren</em> (his only surviving grandson having renounced his rights to the French throne to become King Philip V of Spain), being succeeded by his five-year-old great-grandson, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXV">Louis XV</a>.
<ul><li> Louis XV also outlived all but four of his ten children, including both his sons and was succeeded by his grandson <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXVI">Louis XVI</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EleanorOfAquitaine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EleanorOfAquitaine">Eleanor Of Aquitaine</a> outlived her four oldest sons William, Henry, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalFavoritism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalFavoritism">dear Richard</a> and Geoffrey. Ironically John, the only one she didn't outlive, was her husband's favorite since he was the only one who never betrayed him for her.

His wife, Jackie, was devastated and considered killing herself - until she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer (she died less than a year after Selena).
</li><li> François Joseph Lefebvre, one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoleon</a>'s Marshals, had fourteen kids. Only the eldest lived past his twenties, and he died during the Russian campaign while fighting under his father's orders.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII">Henry VIII</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a> was spurred by the fact that the children he kept having with first wife Catherine of Aragon almost always died. During the course of their marriage, they had approximately ten children, and only one — the future Mary I — survived infancy. He also lost Henry Fitzroy (his son by one of his mistresses, Bessie Blount) and his second child with Anne Boleyn.
<ul><li> Henry himself only became king because his parents, Henry VII and Elizabeth of York, experienced this trope with the death of their eldest son Arthur, Prince of Wales. Henry and Elizabeth also had a few other sons and daughters who died in infancy, with only four (Arthur, Margaret, Henry, and Mary) reaching their teens. Youngest child Katherine, only a few days old, died the day before Elizabeth herself did, on her 37th birthday; as Elizabeth was extremely ill, it's quite likely that she was not informed that she had outlived yet another child.
</li><li> Henry VII's mother, Margaret Beaufort, also suffered from this trope. Henry was her only child; she had him so young that she was rendered infertile after the birth. By the time she herself died, she was nicknamed "Venerable Margaret" by the people and had outlived all three of her husbands, her son, her daughter-in-law, all but three of her grandchildren, and her two eldest great-grandchildren.
</li><li> Elizabeth of York's mother, Elizabeth Woodville, also experienced this. Of her ten children by Edward IV, one died in infancy, one as a child, and one as a teenager. After her husband's death, his brother Richard took custody of the surviving sons, "<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princes_in_the_Tower">the Princes in the Tower<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>", and nobody was ever entirely sure what happened to them... but they were all pretty certain they were dead since their uncle had them declared illegitimate and proclaimed himself Richard III. Remains which may be theirs were unearthed in the Tower of London a few centuries later, but to this day their exact fate remains unknown. She also lost one of her two children from her first marriage, Richard Grey, who was executed by Richard III.

The one surviving daughter, Adéle, was mentally unstable and lived out her days in an institution.

</li><li> American rocket scientist Jack Parsons, the inventor of modern perchlorate-based solid rocket fuel and one of the founders of Aerojet, died in a lab accident in his garage on June 17, 1952, at the age of 37.

</li><li> Notorious gangster James "Whitey" Bulger had one son in 1967, whom by all reliable accounts he genuinely loved.

Whitey himself lived until he was murdered in prison in 2018.

</li><li> Many US Presidents have outlived their children for one reason or another:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington">George Washington</a> was Martha Washington's second husband; before him, she was married to Daniel Parke Custis and they had four children before he died in 1757. Martha outlived all of her children: two died in childhood, the other two in young adulthood. She had no children with George. Hes believed to have been sterilized by a bout of scarlet fever in his youth.

It's believed that the death of their third son, Tad, in 1871 contributed to Mary's already declining mental health and increasingly erratic behavior, and Robert had her committed to a mental institution for her own safety.

</li><li> Hugh O'Connor, the adopted son of acclaimed TV actor Carroll O'Connor, died by suicide in 1995 after a long battle with addiction. A grieving Carroll successfully lobbied to pass a law allowing family members of drug addicts to sue dealers for medical treatment and rehabilitation.

</li><li> The phrase "may you outlive your sons" is used as a curse against someone in certain countries. It can even be said in a very congenial tone, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInsult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInsult">making it sound as if the speaker is simply wishing for the health and long life of the recipient, but is actually one of the deepest expressions of contempt</a>.

</li><li> Youngest son Chris died by suicide in 1991, shooting himself. Chris wanted to wrestle, but due to his small size (he was listed as 5 feet, 7 inches and weighing 201 pounds) and a medical history of asthma, he had little chance of succeeding.
</li><li> Fourth son Kerry (the most successful of the boys, who became NWA World Champion in 1984) died by suicide in 1993, shooting himself in the heart.
