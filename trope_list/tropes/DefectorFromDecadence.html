</li><li> Souken Ishida spent years trying to convince the Soul Reapers that it was necessary for the Quincies and Soul Reapers to learn how to work together, but he could never make the Soul Reapers listen. He also taught Uryuu not to hate the Soul Reapers for their past massacre of the Quincies because the Quincies had been in the wrong.

Both versions have him eventually joining the Order much later.

The subsequent exile to Japan, and invasion of said country only cements his desire to obliterate the Britannian Empire and deliver cold vengeance to his father.

<ul><li> The most famous of these defectors was arguably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista">Batista</a>. For more than two years, he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute">The Brute</a> in Evolution, a faction on <em>Monday Night Raw</em> that also consisted of Hunter Hearst Helmsley (a.k.a. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a>), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">Ric Flair</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a>. After Orton was expelled from the group in the summer of 2004, however, Batista began to have second thoughts about being a member of Evolution. He kept a low profile at first, though, ostensibly remaining an ally of Helmsley and Flair while privately expressing disgust at their methods. It wasn't until he won the Royal Rumble Match in January 2005 and was presented with an opportunity to challenge Helmsley for his World Heavyweight Championship that Batista realized that the moment for defection had come. After pretending to sign a contract that would have moved him to <em>SmackDown!</em> to challenge John "Bradshaw" Layfield for the WWE Championship, Batista revealed that he would stay on <em>Raw</em> by powerbombing Triple H and challenging him for his championship at <em>WrestleMania</em>. This marked Batista's official exit from Evolution — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupBreakout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupBreakout">and the beginning of his highly successful singles career</a>.
</li><li> And, in a reverse example in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a>, Flair himself turned his back on his group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Fortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Fortune">Fortune</a> in early 2011 after the other members turned face and declared war on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a>'s faction, Immortal, with which Fortune had been closely affiliated up to that time; Flair officially declared his allegiance to Immortal, becoming a mentor to Matt Hardy.

She had gained notoriety on the program over the past year with her "Extreme Expose," a combination dance/burlesque routine that definitely put the "Extreme" in ECW. Early in 2007, the act became a three-woman show when Layla El and Brooke Adams joined Kelly in her performances. The girls at first simply entertained the crowds in between matches, but soon they found themselves unofficial cheerleaders for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz">The Miz</a>, who had recently been drafted to the promotion from <em>SmackDown!</em> One night Miz's opponent was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BallsMahoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BallsMahoney">Balls Mahoney</a>, and Kelly realized that she had become smitten with him. She began to show sympathy for Mahoney, as well as resentment toward The Miz and Layla and Brooke for bullying him. She tried to quit Extreme Expose (her own creation!) but quickly found out that she <em>couldn't</em>, because Miz owned all three girls' contracts. In the end, The Miz cut his ties with Extreme Expose to become John Morrison's tag-team partner, Brooke left <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> only to be reborn as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">"Miss Tessmacher"</a> (Eric Bischoff's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexySecretary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexySecretary">Sexy Secretary</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a>), and Kelly and Layla became bitter enemies for the rest of their stay in ECW and later on Smackdown.

</li><li> The Farsight Enclaves broke away from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">Tau Empire</a> when Commander Farsight discovered that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem">Ethereals</a> were covering up the existence of the Warp and daemons, as it conflicted with their own secular agenda.

Prime examples include:
<ul><li> The Sons Of Ether/Technocracy split in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension">Mage: The Ascension</a></em>. Sons Of Ether are basically people who think that science should stay <em>awesome</em>, and the Technocracy wanted the Etherites to follow the instruction manual.
</li><li> Similarly, the Virtual Adepts, reality hackers who left after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeethovenWasAnAlienSpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeethovenWasAnAlienSpy">the Technocracy had Alan Turing killed for his</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSpeak">crimethink tendencies</a>.

And Adonai of the Salubri inverted the trope, breaking from the Salubri (who opted out of vampiric decadence altogether) and joining the Sabbat to get his revenge on the Tremere. The result was the Salubri <em>antitribu</em>.
</li><li> In <em>Vampire: The Masquerade</em>, any vampire that doesn't align with the bulk of their clan's political affiliation is considered <em>antitribu</em> - what counts as defecting to or from decadence depends heavily on the individual's point of view.
<ul><li> An especially interesting case is clan Lasombra. The bulk of clan Lasombra are members of the Sabbat, and consider Camarilla-affiliated Lasombra to be the <em>antitribu</em>. The Camarilla Lasombra consider <em>themselves</em> to be the clan proper, and will take any indication that they aren't extremely poorly.
</li></ul></li><li> The Forsaken/Pure split in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheForsaken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheForsaken">Werewolf: The Forsaken</a></em> and all the other tribes' views of the Get Of Fenris in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse">Werewolf: The Apocalypse</a></em>.

<ul><li> The <em>Werewolf: the Apocalypse</em> story collection had a short story featuring a redeemed Black Spiral Dancer gone ronin.
</li><li> Uktena (the totem spirit of the Uktena tribe) was once a servant of the original balance-Wyrm. When the Wyrm went insane, Uktena promptly defected to the Wyld.

</li><li> Solas is an elven hermit apostate who avoids both the city elves and the Dalish, fond of pointing out flaws and inaccuracies in Dalish beliefs, in particular holding a much less rose-colored view of the ancient elven culture of Arlathan. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Of course he knows better: he was there.

</li><li> The Inquisitor can also be this depending on your dialogue choices. For example, the Dalish Inquisitor can agree with Solas' dismissive views of contemporary Dalish culture. The Qunari Inquisitor's parents were Tal-Vashoth, defectors from the Qun who raised their child away from its restrictions.
</li><li> One of the reasons the Inquisition swells in ranks so rapidly, absorbing misfits and outcasts who denounce their former allegiances as corrupt and/or inefficient, in favor of the one organization that is at least doing something against the current threat.

The Tribunal Temple also persecutes the Nerevarine Cult as heretics (technically they are, just not really of the Temple, seeing as they developed in parallel in response to the same event and from the same source religion. It's actually the Temple who made the most radical changes of dogma, the Nerevarine Cult just explained away the new gods as false gods and added in a messiah figure). Both of those change towards the end of the main quest, with the Dissident Priests acknowledged as having had a point with much of what they said and the Nerevarine Cult recognised as being right about the messiah figure thing, both by one of the gods of the Tribunal himself.

This, added to the visions he received from the "Good" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">Daedra</a>, led to the Velothi dissident movement and eventually, their exodus to Morrowind.

When their original homeworld was dying, most of the population moved to the Age of Tehranee, a decadent world of perfect climate and boundless space. A small part of them, however, went to another world, D'ni (or Earth), where they would live underground and be forced to eke out a living through advanced engineering abilities. The purpose of this was, similar to the Amish movement, to prevent decadence from rotting society, and it failed: the exact same kind of sedentarity and elitism that plagued Tehranee also crept into D'ni society, and ultimately caused the downfall of both civilizations. At some time in the series of the games, Atrus builds a new Age, Releeshahn, for the D'ni survivors, and founds a new society meant to address these issues by introducing such policies as social equality.

<ul><li> President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnTyler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnTyler">John Tyler</a> switched from the Democratic party to the Whig party because he didn't like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AndrewJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AndrewJackson">Andrew Jackson</a>'s dictatorial methods. The switch wasn't successful because he remained just Democratic enough that most Whigs couldn't stand him.
</li><li> Flavius Vegetius Renatus: <a class="urllink" href="http://www.military-quotes.com/vegetius-renatus.htm">"To seduce the enemies soldiers from their allegiance and encourage them to surrender is of special service, for an adversary is more hurt by desertion than by slaughter."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Missing records and contradictory stories make it hard to tell how much this applied to history, but legendary samurai <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YagyuJubei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YagyuJubei">Yagyu Jubei</a> is often portrayed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior</a> who spent years <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth">Walking the Earth</a> after being banished due to his disdain for court politics and blunt ways.
</li><li> Democratic senator <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Douglas">Stephen Douglas<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was, for a time, considered as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for president in 1860 when he defied his party and fellow Democrat President James Buchanan over their attempts to pass a slave code that would have made Kansas a slave state regardless of whether the people wished it to be a slave or free state. For all intents and purposes, Douglas' near defection split the Democratic party's northern and southern wings as Douglas would become one of two Democratic candidates for President in 1860, (the other being John Breckenridge) with Douglas getting nearly all of his support from the Northern Democrats. For their part, the Republicans wound up picking some obscure former Congressman named Abraham Lincoln instead, who, due to the split among Democrats, was able to win with just 40% of the popular vote. (Although, since it was a four-way race, 40% was quite a bit more than Lincoln's nearest rival). After Lincoln's election, Douglas urged the South to accept Lincoln and attempted to work to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a>. When the South did secede, he condemned the action and rallied support for the North, but died not long after the war's onset.
<ul><li> Lincoln was not exactly obscure — he was the Republican challenger for Douglas' Senate seat in 1858, and although he didn't win, his famous debates with Douglas made him well-known among Republicans, although not considered a contender for the Republican nomination until he was nominated.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Buddhism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Buddhism">Siddharta Gautama Buddha the Sage of the Shakyas</a>, founder of Buddhism. Quite famous for leaving his princely life and becoming an ascetic.
<ul><li> Though interestingly he defected from strict asceticism as well, and went on to find his own, famous path.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain">Mark Twain</a> was originally a die-hard American nationalist, but later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">switched sides</a> to become an anti-imperialist, citing disillusionment with the expansionist US foreign policy of the early 1900s.
</li><li> Many real-life defectors from communist nation-states were the elite of society. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Defectors">[1]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-25">[2]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Belenko">[3]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The industrialist Fritz Thyssen was originally an ardent supporter of Hitler and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">the Nazi Party</a>, up until he was thoroughly disgusted by Kristallnacht. He literally defected from Germany, causing Hitler to personally declare him an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson">Un-person</a>, and holed up in France... until France was overrun in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo">World War II</a>. He was thrown into a concentration camp but still managed to survive the war.
<ul><li> This seemed to happen a lot with the Nazis, maybe why there were 27 or so <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_attempts_on_Adolf_Hitler">attempts on Hitler's life<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> between '34 and '44, not including 10 or so in '33, and another 4 before that.
</li></ul></li><li> Saint Patrick's Battalion in the Mexican-American war, a majority-Catholic group of soldiers who defected from the US Army to side with Mexico. Reasons for the defection vary, but most of them fall under this trope: many were Catholics/immigrants embittered by mistreatment and cultural alienation from the largely Protestant/nativist American forces, many were Irish soldiers who saw America as doing the same thing to Mexico that England had done to Ireland, and some were escaped black slaves who were understandably disenchanted with the United States.
<ul><li> Similarly, many of the Irish rebellions against British rule saw Irish Catholic soldiers defecting to join the rebels. By the Irish War of Independence, this had come to include English and Scottish Catholics of Irish descent.
</li><li> A really bizarre one was the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenian_raids">Fenian raids<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, in which Irishmen based in the United States attacked British forts in Canada, which Washington supposedly ignored because they were still angry with Britain for toying with backing the Confederacy in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">the late unpleasantness</a>.
</li><li> And the Connaught Rangers, an all-Irish regiment of soldiers serving the British Empire in India, defected almost immediately upon hearing news of the Irish War of Independence. Moral of the story - do not piss off the Irish.
</li></ul></li><li> Street gangs see a lot of abandonment from their founding 'OGs' due to the shift in values (many gangs are started for neighborhood protection but then the drug trade becomes too lucrative, leading the gangs to become more like criminal enterprises). Many founding members feel like the new generation doesn't have the respect and focus that they have and can no longer tolerate it.
</li><li> Japanese Trip-Hop artist DJ Krush was a Yakuza member before beginning his musical career. One day <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yubitsume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yubitsume">he discovered a severed finger wrapped in paper on his desk</a>; after discovering that it had belonged to his best friend, he decided to leave.
</li><li> Two Libyan fighter pilots, when ordered to bomb protesting civilians, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">flew out of Libya and defected.</a> All in all, <em>forty thousand</em> Libyan troops defected to the rebel/UN side.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader">Rebel Leader</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Abdul_Jalil">Mustafa Abdul Jalil<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was Minister of Justice under Gaddafi until Gaddafi started slaughtering protesters.
</li></ul></li><li> Legendary anarchist theorist Pyotr Kropotkin was a Russian prince and Mikhail Bakunin belonged to a noble family (albeit one of "modest means"), and both rejected their privileged positions. Both ended up imprisoned for some time and later fled/were expelled into exile.
<ul><li> Leo Tolstoy (who was a count), as well, although he didn't end up going to prison. The Russians seem to have a long and pronounced tradition of Russian nobles becoming anarchists and giving up their titles and possessions. Similarly, the sons and grandchildren of Russian Orthodox Priests (who could be married men) were also responsible for so many revolutionary ideas that "Son of a Priest" became an insult.
<ul><li> In the 19th and 20th centuries it was the Russian nobility and upper classes, and not the Russian middle-classes or industrial workers, that made up most of the country's political radicals and dissidents. The Russian middle class was both weak and tiny, due to the power of the (state-run) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">companies</a> they worked for, and big-factory workers weren't much more numerous or better organised by comparison (cottage industry, and small-factory-based-light-industry, employed most of the workers in even the 1913 manufacturing sector). That said, most of said radicals and dissidents came from the less well-off or impoverished echelons of the nobility and priesthood.
</li><li> Another Tolstoy example might be Count Aleksey Nikolaevich Tolstoy, a distant relative of Leo Tolstoy. He fled Russia after the Revolution, but embraced communism and returned to the Soviet Union where he became one of Stalin's favorite authors and made major contributions to early science fiction.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Louis Philippe, the Duke of Orleans. He became a major supporter for the revolutionary causes during the French Revolution and changed his name to Citizen Equality (Citoyen Egalite), abandoning his aristocratic status. Unfortunately for him, things did not go well for him during the Terror.
</li><li> In 2011 and 2012, the Free Syrian Army received several high ranking (colonel &amp; up) defectors from the Syrian military such as Riad al-Asaad, Mustafa al-Sheikh, Salim Idris, and Abdul-Ilah al-Bashir. But by late 2014, the FSA has taken heavy losses in the Syrian civil war and is now a fraction of its former strength, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist">Islamic State</a> becoming the prime opposition group to the Syrian government.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Skanderbeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Skanderbeg">Skanderbeg</a> was once a Janissary guard for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OttomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OttomanEmpire">Ottoman Empire</a> that actually rose to the position of the local governor. However, being forcibly conscripted into the position in the first place, the deaths of his siblings in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">Turkish court</a>, seeing his homeland of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Albania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Albania">Albania</a> being exploited and inspired by the struggle of other Christian states led to him switch sides and lead his quarter-century campaign against the Ottomans.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Malaysia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Malaysia">Malaysia</a>'s Mahathir exploited this trope a few times during his political career by temporarily quitting his party UMNO. He relied on his massive political clout in hopes of alienating his target and forcing UMNO to oust his target. Mahathir accused Abdullah Ahmad Badawi of incompetence, quit the party and succeeded getting UMNO to oust Abdullah as Prime Minister, after which Mahathir rejoined UMNO. Later on, Mahathir accused Najib of corruption and tried the same trick, but this time without much success since Najib held a stronger grip on UMNO. Mahathir eventually formed another political party and officially declared that UMNO no longer represents what it stands for, which makes exploiting of this trope all the more obvious.
</li><li> There are numerous members of the Phelps family who left <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist">The Fundamentalist</a> Westboro Baptist Church, because they grew disgusted at their own family's arrogant self-righteousness expressed by their notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActivistFundamentalistAntics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActivistFundamentalistAntics">Activist Fundamentalist Antics</a>. Even Fred Phelps himself grew disillusioned with the path Westboro was taking near the end of his life, trying to calm and redirect the church to more benevolent causes before he was excommunicated.
