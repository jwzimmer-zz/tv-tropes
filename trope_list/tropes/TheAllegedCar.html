It outweighs and outguns the rest of the team's vehicle park on its own, but its engine, suspension, or fuel system will conk out at the least opportune moment. In its first appearance, it gets stuck in the mud, breaks down, and <em>spontaneously catches fire</em> before even getting into firing range. Its later track record is better, due to hard work from the Automotive Club, but it still has a much higher mechanical failure rate that the team's other panzers.
</li><li> When they're first found, <em>all</em> of Oarai's tanks are treated this way, as they're the bottom-of-the-barrel machines that the school couldn't sell when the Tankery program ended 20 years ago and they've been left sitting with no maintainence and most of them exposed to the elements.

He could only afford a single snow tire for the rear end. He had to load the trunk with sandbags to get any traction. He tried to drive it after a blizzard and wound up skidding sideways at 50 mph before crashing into a tree. At least he tried to make it cooler by painting "CAPTAIN AMERICA" down the side.
</li><li> The title routine on <em>200 M.P.H.</em> includes a bit about getting heckled by a Volkswagen driver after his Rolls-Royce breaks down, followed by his skewering of VWs and the problems they have - such as getting blown into the ditch by passing trucks and losing in a head-on collision with a dog.

Its status as this even gets weaponized in one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> novels - because the Falcon is continually being redesigned and repaired, the Empire has three totally different confirmed sensor profiles for the ship gathered over a period of only <em>four years</em>, and as a result have to assume that the bizarre sensor profile being given off by two distant fighters acting as decoy really is the Falcon, luring them away from targets of actual value.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveBarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveBarry">Dave Barry</a> covers this a few times:
<ul><li> In the column "Lemon Harangue", he talks about his father's unerringly awful car buying instincts:
<div class="indent"><em>For example, my father was one of the very few Americans who bought the Hillman Minx, a wart-shaped British car with the same rakish, sporty appeal as a municipal parking garage but not as much pickup. Our Minx also had a Surprise Option Feature whereby the steering mechanism would disconnect itself at random moments, so you'd suddenly discover that you could spin the wheel all the way around in a playful circle without having any effect whatsoever on the front wheels... You don't see many Minxes around anymore, probably because the factory was bombed by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.</em>
</div></li><li> In <em>Dave Barry Does Japan</em>, he mentions that his own first new car was a Chevrolet Vega, which was "made of compressed rust".
</li><li> He once owned a Fiat, which "rusted on the assembly line." It was easy to find in a crowded parking lot, as all he had to do was follow the sound of parts falling off.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DaveBarrySleptHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DaveBarrySleptHere">Dave Barry Slept Here</a></em> also makes this claim about the Ford Model T:
<div class="indent">By modern standards, the Model T was very primitive: It had no electric starter, no radio, no heater, no air conditioner, no brakes, no transmission, no engine, and no wheels. The only way to get it to actually move was to have four or five burly men pick it up and stagger down the street. But it was affordable, and people bought it like crazy. "What the hell," they said. "There's nowhere to go anyway, here in 1913."
</div></li></ul></li><li> One set of <em>Beachcomber</em> columns describes the saga of the Alleged Ship <em>Saucy Mrs. Flobster</em>, flagship of the Lots Road Power Station, and an attempt by the Government to sell her to Afghanistan. The ship is too waterlogged to burn, is missing vital components such as masts, sails, rudders and most of the hull, and the previous purchasers (Lichtenstein) offered sevenpence but pulled out when they saw what they'd be buying. It's only at the very end that anyone wonders why the Lots Road Power Station ever needed a navy in the first place.

No parts are made for it, so it consumes a lot of cash and paperwork to keep operational, especially given that over the course of the book it's in an earthquake and a blizzard, and it narrowly misses being crushed by a flying hydraulic arm from a garbage truck. It is also stated to have an air conditioner that smells like ozone; at least once, Lucretia took a ride in it after being drunk and stuck in garbage truck, which couldn't have helped the smell.

</li><li> The Doctor from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> apparently has a particular affection for this trope.

The pink teddy bear design is just an unfortunate aesthetic, the sluggish performance is an inconvenience; when it breaks down in midair, it becomes an actual problem. Luckily, the breakdown is gradual enough for the riders to reach ground alive, but they don't trust the carpet for further trips and give it over to a repair expert while they seek alternate transportation.

</div></li><li> Newspaper columnist D.L. Stewart recounts, via his book <em>Father Knows Best — Sometimes</em>, the considerable trouble he has with his MG Midget, which a salesman refers to at one point as "the English Edsel". When told it's in average shape for a Midget, the same salesman's response is "That bad, huh?" In six years, it gains 42,000 miles on its odometer, 20,000 of which come while it's attached to the back of a tow truck. Later on, some of the cars that his oldest son looks at (and in one case, actually buys) also qualify.

He replaces it with another one, in showroom condition, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NurseryCrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NurseryCrime">The Fourth Bear</a></em> — it turns out it's only still running because he bought it from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePictureOfDorianGray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePictureOfDorianGray">Dorian Gray</a> and there's a picture of the car that suffers all the damage and breakdowns the car would otherwise be subject to. Over the course of the book, the damage sustained reaches such an extent that the picture collapses into an interdimensional portal, dragging the car and anyone in it to hell.

Aleks is a mechanic so good at his job, it borders on supernatural, and he's sworn that he'll make the car work properly. He's been trying, along with Nikita, for several years now, and they've never managed to make its engine run for more than fifteen minutes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens">Good Omens</a></em> loves this trope. Interestingly, strange events lead to all of them improving over the course of the book.
<ul><li> Newton Pulsifer has a Wasabi. He named it after famous British highwayman Dick Turpin, because "wherever I go, I hold up traffic". It's described as being made in Japan during an awkward interim period; they had stopped ripping off Western designs, but had yet to perfect their own, leading to a car with all the flaws of Western cars and some new ones only the Japanese could devise. It has incredible gas mileage, but it spends an inordinate amount of time in the shop. It has a voice (recorded by someone "who spoke neither Japanese nor English") that would randomly recite "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseRanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseRanguage">prease to frasten sleat-bert</a>". It would deploy airbags on dangerous occasions, like when a faulty airbag has suddenly obstructed your view of the road. Newton's attempts to convince others to buy one are motivated by the idea that misery loves company. It gets improved by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAntiChrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAntiChrist">Adam</a> in the denouement, such that, for example, instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Engrish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Engrish">Engrish</a> the vocal warnings are delivered in the form of pleasant haiku.

But near the end of the book, he drives it like mad to get from London to Tadfield during a huge traffic jam (including <em>leaping through a wall of fire caused by a cursed motorway Crowley designed</em>), and what's left of it afterwards definitely qualifies as an Alleged Car, assuming it qualifies as a car at all.
</li><li> Anathema Device has an Alleged Bicycle, possibly made of drainpipes. It too gets improved after Crowley knocks it over in his Bentley and Aziraphale fixes it with a miracle, who then has to gloss over her feeble protests that it didn't <em>use</em> to have a basket, air pump, or gears.

The car is described as having a single headlight, a three cylinder engine, and a candlelit interior. The car is also said to have performed best out of four leading European car models in a crash test involving being driven into a wall at 60 kph, but that's because the car broke down repeatedly and never reached the wall.

He <em>claims</em> it's an antique, but it appears to made from rust, it has a 0.5 percent chance of starting the first time you turn the key, it's often propped by bricks because the handbrake is broken, any replacement part would be worth more than the rest of the car itself put together, and it foils a bank robbery in the opening chapter because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">the robber chose it as his getaway vehicle</a> and couldn't get it to start before the police arrived.

They tried to let it get stolen by leaving the doors unlocked in the middle of New York City, but all that happened was that a lot of people used the car as a place to have sex. Eventually, to get rid of the car, they sold it under false pretenses to one of the writers for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em>; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">they were that desperate</a>.

It's basically an airship Millennium Falcon, made almost entirely of scrap parts and seemingly held together with string and prayer. In a subversion, though, it's made of scrap parts from <em>very powerful airships</em>, by a legitimately talented engineer, and is only unreliable briefly as Tom hasn't yet learned all of the controls and only a quarter of them are labelled in a language he can understand. Its lightweight rust-bucket chassis basically turns it into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> of the airship world that can outrun or outmanoeuvre military-class fighters.

Among others, it lacks a hand brake, two windows, the inside light, seat covers (Witkacy uses blankets), and a working ventillation system, and it's considered too dangerous for any company to insure it. He defends it vehemently, though, and appears to be right, as it never fails (though sometimes takes several times to start up).

</li><li> In the early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Spenser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Spenser">Spenser</a></em> detective novels, Spenser drives several of these. The first was a 1968 Chevy convertible in such awful condition that everyone he meets remarks on it. He justifies keeping it by saying that if it gets damaged in the line of duty, he doesn't care all that much. He later wrecks a Subaru somewhere near the Charles River locks. By the 1990s, he's switched to something better, but he still loses cars with some frequency after that, and implies he's never too attached to them.

They were usually barely airworthy, let alone spaceworthy, and only used by desperate bandits. The most infamous was the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Die-Wing</a>", a <a class="urllink" href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/TYE-wing">TIE fighter cockpit with Y-wing engines<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a slow, unshielded, weak-hulled, lightly-armed, flying death trap. It was even less reliable than the Imperial ship it was based on, which was designed for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">expendable pilots</a>. The worst Uglies' main advantage was that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">they were notoriously unpredictable to trace</a>. That said, a few instead reached <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Ace Custom</a> territory, thanks to more standardized build schemes or better engineers.

When she doesn't have a car of her own, she's forced to drive her Uncle Sandor's powder blue 1953 Buick Roadmaster "Big Blue". It's large, it's ugly, and Stephanie hates it, but most men love it, and it is practically indestructible.

Adam Biggs walked one interviewer through many of the quirks: the driver's side door was effectively unusable because it would not shut unless one put all of their body weight into slamming it (which means that they had to enter through the passenger's side and climb over the seat to get to the driver's seat), the back door needed to be held up while holding the lock to get the lock to engage, the AC wouldn't turn on while the cruise control was engaged, the speedometer and gas gauge both jumped all over the place at random intervals, the oil pressure light was on constantly because the sensor was busted (the oil pressure was actually fine at the time of the interview as per Biggs), there was no left audio channel, the passenger side mirror was prone to swinging inwards when the door was closed, closing the glovebox made the audio exceedingly quiet until one manually pressed the tape in the cassette deck down, and finally, the rear heat did not work, only the AC. It was quite the spectacle, but they got a much better van and presumably sold the old one for whatever they could get for it in scrap value.

</li><li> His Citroën rusted, trundled, leaked a lot and forced him to buy a bag full of uncommon tools.
</li><li> His Italian car could actually achieve a high RPM, but didn't last long.
</li><li> His second English car was a Hillman. He could <em>hear</em> it rust, the engine refused to work, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">the windscreen wiper didn't work either</a>.
</li><li> The De Soto was shiny and had a large engine, but ran out of fuel after driving a mere 100 metres.
</li><li> He currently has an unknown English car, which is no better than the others. The key snaps when he starts it, and he can't drive more than a mile before it stops. He also mentions that it sinks when he drives into a river - a pretty common problem for cars, but its inclusion suggests that he knows it from experience and that it happened because the car has horrible handling.

<ul><li> The Hetzer Wheeled Assault Gun is an alleged <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness">tank</a></em>. Among its "virtues" are a fairly slow wheeled chassis that prevents it from traversing many types of terrain compounded by lack of a turret for its only weapon, a battery weak enough that its engine needs to keep running nonstop to keep it charged, and a tendency to reach the customer not quite fully assembled at times. (If you're lucky, somebody thought to include the bolts to fix the last components in place.) Thank you, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestJohnsDealership" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestJohnsDealership">Quickcell Armories</a>. It arguably <em>is</em> one of the cheapest ways available to field an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">AC/20</a>, but between its flaws and the fact that its big gun makes it an obvious fire magnet it's no surprise that many of its crews consider it a rolling coffin in-universe.

A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> with armor that can't protect it from a <em>machine gun</em>, it dies if an enemy unit look at it funny (and did we mention it only has short-ranged weaponry?). Worse, the internal flywheel it uses in place of a tail rotor has a nasty habit of breaking loose during hard landings and crashing through the cockpit. In the hangar, it has poorly placed access hatches and a reactor so poorly shielded that the maintenance crew has to wear <em>hazmat</em> gear to work on the machine. Most commands simply strip out the weapons and use them on better machines.
</li><li> There exists the occasional Alleged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> as well. Some Battlemechs are just not ready for prime time and have developed a reputation for being trouble to their own forces and perhaps a punchline as well. Most out-and-out losers quickly go extinct on their own, but then there's strangely long-lived problem children like the <em>Assassin</em>, a 40-ton 'Mech with a reputation for both lousy armor and missile launchers that tend to break down at the worst possible time... which is doubly bad because the bulk of its fighting weight <em>is</em> its missile launchers.
</li><li> Or perhaps you could think of the <em>Daboku</em>, precursor to the production-grade <em>Mauler</em> that is a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype">Flawed Prototype</a>. It is slow. It is absurdly lightly armored. Its weapons are low-powered for its weight. It overheats at the slightest provocation. Finally, it has an annoying tendency to eject its pilot when struck even by the mildest of torso hits (though this is probably for the best).
</li><li> Another Alleged BattleMech is the <em>Matar</em>, a 110-ton superheavy Mech designed during the Amaris Civil War as a machine intended to withstand an entire BattleMech company assault. It was quickly reduced to a fiasco and thus became known as "Amaris' Folly" when the leg actuators shut down during powered movement because of the extreme stresses it takes for each of the actuators to undergo; the project was scrapped and Amaris' faction eventually lost the war when they could not find new ideas to overcome Aleksandr Kerensky's forces.
</li><li> The optional "Design Quirks" rules introduced in the <em>Strategic Operations</em> rule book adds a number of negative quirks to combat assets due to poor quality standards or designs, such as "Poor Workmanship" (more easily destroyed by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Hit</a>), "Poor sealing" (requires piloting checks to ensure the cockpit remains hermetically sealed), among a host of others like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring">poor targeting computers</a> and sensor suites.

It's worth a lot of Slack (points), but it's very expensive, reduces your effective Income for each turn by 1, and every turn it has a one-in-six chance of breaking down beyond repair.

The owner needs the insurance money to pay her husband's medical bills. Wei suggests selling it before being asked to crash it.

Despite supposedly being a rare and top-of-the-line vessel, theirs has definitely seen a lot of better days and its status as something of a rustbucket is lampshaded on several occasions.

It was a rushed, poorly constructed replacement for the A-Wing, with poor maneuverability and an outdated navi-computer. The Rebels quickly realized this and decided it was best to just sell them to third parties for some quick cash. Surprisingly, the craft actually became quite popular in the Outer Rim thanks to the cheap parts, and probably some illegal tune ups. It's not much of a stretch given that, among their primary buyers, were pirates.

</li><li> The Datsun 240Z that puked oil all over the track, broke frequently, and almost got them bounced from their event for being a general hazard.
</li><li> And the 1975 Corvette with no windshield, gutted interior, and brakes so bad, they did a slow down slide around on a stop sign and got pulled over.
</li><li> <em>General Mayhem</em>, a Charger (well, some of it is) with a motorhome engine (later replaced by a Hellcat engine) and some parts out of a wreck that died on them at the "24 Hours of Lemons" event (a whole racing competition specifically for Alleged Cars!) and some improvised bits. Authorities refused to register it.

</li><li> The Technodrome from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987)</a>.</em> It is a legitimately deadly war machine, when it works. Unfortunately for the bad guys, that's almost never. Many a scheme was hatched just to get the darn thing running and it would remain trapped inoperable for entire seasons at a time. You could actually tell which season of the show you were watching by the location of the Technodrome. First, it was under New York, then it was in Dimension X, then it was in the center of the Earth, then it was trapped on a particular asteroid in Dimension X, it returned to Earth but was trapped in the Arctic, then it was at the bottom of the ocean until finally it was sent back to Dimension X, but without Shredder and Krang.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em> series feature several alleged vehicles, though only one of them is a car:
<ul><li> The Lame-o-sine, complete with an obnoxious set of bull horns on the front.
</li><li> The Boat of Losers, though it was probably in the best of shape compared to the other alleged vehicles.
</li><li> The single prop plane in <em>Island</em> and the Total Drama Jumbo Jet are certainly less than airworthy, with the former's wings falling off after one flight and the latter's front-end falling off in the <em>Action</em> special.
</li><li> The contestant-built bikes in "That's Off the Chain" were built from scrap materials. Some held together while others fell apart or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">blew up</a>.
