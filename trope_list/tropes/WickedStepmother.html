</p><p>Psychologists hypothesize that she is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchetypalCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchetypalCharacter">Archetypal Character</a>, devised by children to contain all they hate in their mothers so they can continue to regard Mother as perfect. Some historians, meanwhile, believe that the trope has didactic roots and that it was developed as a way of warning children against potentially untrustworthy suitors that might try to court their widowed parents for their wealth or their nobility; indeed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByChildbirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByChildbirth">Death by Childbirth</a> was extremely common in the Middle Ages, leading to many children of the period being raised by stepmothers.
</p><p>Sadly enough, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>; children are vastly more likely to be abused by stepparents. In fact, in some languages, the word for "stepmother" is the word for "mother" followed by a pejorative suffix.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0iug9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0iug9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0iug9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In Spanish <em>madrastra</em> — the Latin suffix is the same as in "poetaster," a hack poet; in French, the cognate <em>marâtre</em> is now <em>so</em> associated with this trope that it's only used for wicked ones, with the common word being <em>belle-mère</em>, same as "mother-in-law."</span> Even centuries of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a> have not transformed her into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope">Discredited Trope</a>; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadHorseTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadHorseTrope">she can still be played either straight or subverted</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>She generally favors her own children — whether from a previous marriage or this one — over her stepchildren. Not that that causes this trope, because it's kind of natural. It's just another symptom. Sometimes her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed">economic motives</a> are made clear: there is only so much to go around, and she wants it for herself or her own children. An equivalent male figure is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle">Evil Uncle</a> — because inheritance is generally through the male line, the uncle can inherit his brother's children's estate. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">Envy</a> is another common cause; the Wicked Stepmother either wants to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairestOfThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairestOfThemAll">Fairest of Them All</a> or to have her daughters be so.
</p><p>On the other hand, the stepsiblings or halfsiblings can but need not be hostile to the hero(ine). If they are hostile, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungestChildWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungestChildWins">Youngest Child Wins</a> is trumped by the older child's stepchild status.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">father</a> is seldom a factor. If not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidowWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidowWoman">dead</a> (which is common), he will nevertheless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless">never intervene</a> on his child's behalf.
</p><p>Her tactics vary widely. She may simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CinderellaCircumstances" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CinderellaCircumstances">oppress the heroine, keeping her in rags and slaving at household work</a> — sometimes going as far as assigning the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask">Impossible Task</a>. As a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedWitch">Wicked Witch</a>, she may <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph">transform</a> the child(ren) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism">into animals</a>. She may drive or send them off. She may act <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyViolence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyViolence">violently</a> toward them and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyDeath">kill</a> them (and perhaps cap that by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">cooking them up and serving them to their father</a>.) Rarely is she ever a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LecherousStepparent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LecherousStepparent">Lecherous Stepparent</a>.
</p><p>The stepchild(ren) may succeed in defeating her through help from their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfinishedBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfinishedBusiness">real though dead mother</a> — the Grimms' version of "Cinderella", "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/cinderella/stories/german.html">Aschenputtel<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>", has Aschenputtel get her gowns from the tree planted on her mother's grave. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingAnimal">Talking Animals</a> may also feature, as can a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyGodmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyGodmother">Fairy Godmother</a>. These figures can do everything from performing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask">Impossible Task</a> on behalf of the child to ensuring that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely">She Cleans Up Nicely</a> despite the dirt and rags she is reduced to.
</p><p>This trope is sometimes the result of writers attempting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">Bowdlerise</a> fairy tales by transforming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMatriarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMatriarch">cruel mother</a> into a wicked stepmother. For instance, Grimms' original tales of "Snow White" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HanselAndGretel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HanselAndGretel">Hansel and Gretel</a>" both featured a cruel mother.
</p><p>Given her status as a villain, the Wicked Stepmother's chances of surviving the ending are not good. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter">Happily Ever After</a> ending of most fairy tales often dwells with more detail on how the Wicked Stepmother and/or her children were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyViolence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyViolence">punished</a> than on the hero and happiness. On the other hand, stepmothers who are not disposed of often return; when she is not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyDeath">executed at the wedding</a>, she may, for instance, try to kill the heroine when she gives birth and replace her with her own daughter; so the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyTale">Fairy Tale</a> doesn't end (happily or not) until she's dead.
</p><p>Sometimes preceded by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuessWhoImMarrying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuessWhoImMarrying">Guess Who I'm Marrying?</a> scenario. Can involve a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">Missing Mom</a>; older stories usually do, often caused by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByChildbirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByChildbirth">Death by Childbirth</a>.
</p><p>A common subversion is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">jealous</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddysGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddysGirl">Daddy's Girl</a> regarding any stepmother as a Wicked Stepmother; see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentWithNewParamour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentWithNewParamour">Parent with New Paramour</a> for cases where it's the children who are in the wrong.
</p><p>The possibility of a Wicked Stepmother may hang over a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlendedFamilyDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlendedFamilyDrama">Blended Family Drama</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHeadedStepchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHeadedStepchild">Red-Headed Stepchild</a> is a particular victim.
</p><p>Subtrope of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMatriarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMatriarch">Evil Matriarch</a>. Note that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalNanny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalNanny">Magical Nanny</a> often becomes a stepmother via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryTheNanny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryTheNanny">Marry the Nanny</a>, but never a wicked one. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfChildDisservices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfChildDisservices">Department of Child Disservices</a> is a modern organized variation. Usually, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialServicesDoesNotExist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialServicesDoesNotExist">Social Services Does Not Exist</a> in stories with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother">Wicked Stepmother</a>. Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodStepmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodStepmother">Good Stepmother</a> for the trope's logical antithesis.

The entire play runs along the same lines; flat and emotionless Cinderella calmly asks pretty-boy Fairy Godparent to burn down the palace, ignores the Prince while obsessing over the meat dishes at the ball, plays matchmaker to the Prince and stepsister. Curiously enough, the cruel and domineering wicked stepmother is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">the only cast member who takes naturally to her role</a>.

In the original manga, Natsue is crueler, but still obsessed with Kaoru, to the point of not caring not only for Himeno but also for her own daughters.

When the mother dies, Fey is sent to live with her father, and his wife and son. The father is cold and dismissive of her, but dies pretty soon in and doesn't have much of a presence.

Notably, Nakia has pretty much no love for <em>any</em> of her family, biological or otherwise. It's revealed from the start that she wants to use black magic to kill off her stepchildren so that her own son Juda can take the throne, but it's also hinted that her love for Juda is centered around her desire to have her bloodline rule Hattusa in revenge for her having to be forced as the king's new bride.

After being partially responsible for her sister's death from overwork, she turns her resentment on her newly-orphaned nephew — accusing him of purposefully making her own son look bad by getting good grades. Kaneki recalls that she slowly phased him out of all family interaction, first reducing the amount of food he was given at meals before finally just leaving him minimal funds to purchase his own food.

She isn't literally the stepmother of the men at Genesis House (if anything, she's more like a foster mother, since many of them are there because their families have insisted on sending them or straight-up won't have them in the house), and she's certainly much more sympathetic than most examples of this trope, to the point where she's nearly a deconstruction. But the fact remains that she doesn't treat the men at all equally — Mark, who reminds her of her dead son, is a favorite from day one, whereas she never likes or trusts Scott despite the fact that he goes out of his way to be honest with her and puts as much effort into the program as anybody.

Kyra's mother is often assumed by many viewers to be her stepmother, despite the film never saying it, presumably because of this trope's influence.

</li><li> The trope is used in various ways in several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie">Agatha Christie</a> stories:
<ul><li> In <em>Appointment with Death</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">the victim</a> is an old woman so tyrannical and flat-out evil that her death is seen as just as regrettable as the victim in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MurderOnTheOrientExpress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MurderOnTheOrientExpress">Murder on the Orient Express</a></em>, who was a kidnapper and murderer of children. She has three stepchildren and one daughter of her own. She mentally abuses them all out of a sadistic desire to see them suffer. This includes driving her own daughter into becoming schizophrenic, her older stepson into divorce, and driving the younger two children into desiring her death. Obviously, one of the family did her in. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Except none of them did.</span>
</li><li> In both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMurderAtTheVicarage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMurderAtTheVicarage">The Murder at the Vicarage</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordEdgwareDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordEdgwareDies">Lord Edgware Dies</a></em>, the daughter of the murdered man in each case hated her father, but also has no love of her stepmother, and tries to pin the murder on her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In both cases, the trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubverted">Double Subverted</a>: the stepdaughter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalTruth">is right</a>, and both stepmothers (Anne Protheroe and Jane Wilkinson) really <em>did</em> murder their husbands.</span>

It's her stepfather, and it turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that he murders her, after having murdered her mother.</span>
</li><li> Emily's stepfather in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CloudOfSparrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CloudOfSparrows">Cloud of Sparrows</a></em>, who beats and whips Emily's brothers and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama">rapes</a> Emily and her mother. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He also murdered Emily's biological father, who was an altogether nicer chap</span>.

Trouble is, Antillus married for political reasons after Max was born, and Max has a legitimate younger brother named Crassus. Maximus has no intention of challenging Crassus' position as heir — however, Lady Antillus would prefer that any threats to her son's inheritance be removed. As such, Max's mother died in an "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident">accident</a>", and Max has been dodging similar attempts on his life since he was 14. Ironically, Maximus and Crassus are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BashBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BashBrothers">extremely close and often work together.</a>
</li><li> Madame Heloise de Villefort in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCountOfMonteCristo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCountOfMonteCristo">The Count of Monte Cristo</a></em> is the young wife of middle-aged prosecutor Villefort, with a spoiled eight-year-old son. She despises Valentine, Villefort's daughter by his previous marriage because all of the property of her grandparents will revert to her rather than her step-brother. She eventually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">goes on a killing spree, poisoning Valentine's maternal grandparents and attempting to poison her husband's paralytic father (his servant is killed instead). The titular Count fakes Valentine's death to get her to safety (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">though he did provide the poison in the first place</a>, in his revenge against Villefort).

To escape justice, she poisons herself, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KicktheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KicktheDog">just to spite her husband</a>, kills <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingtheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingtheOffspring">her son</a> as well.</span>
</li><li> At least partially justified with Katerina Ivanovna Marmeladova, stepmother of Sonya from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CrimeAndPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CrimeAndPunishment">Crime and Punishment</a></em>. While she is the person responsible for driving her to prostitution, all her actions are shown as a result of a mental breakdown caused by struggling with her loss of financial security and social status, an alcoholic husband, and her own terminal illness.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/EvilliousChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/EvilliousChronicles">Daughter of Evil</a></em> novels, Queen Prim poisons most of her stepchildren so her son Kyle can be king. Of course, she doesn't treat her own children any better; forcing the aforementioned son to be king and having him possessed by a demon so he'd be easy to control and using her daughter as little more than a tool in her plans for her son.
</li><li> Mr. Murdstone in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DavidCopperfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DavidCopperfield">David Copperfield</a></em> is an archetypal evil stepfather. He's emotionally abusive and tortures both David and David's mother Clara. He's helped by his equally evil sister Jane. He once beats poor Davy very hard and sends him off to a boarding school, and then to London to work in a factory.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DirgeForPresterJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DirgeForPresterJohn">Dirge for Prester John</a></em>. When Anglitora comes to meet John, Hagia practically adopts the girl as her own.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ElementalMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ElementalMasters">Elemental Masters</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSerpentsShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSerpentsShadow">The Serpent's Shadow</a></em>, the series' Snow White retelling, actually averts this by changing the evil stepmother character into our heroine's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle">evil aunt</a> instead.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PhoenixAndAshes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PhoenixAndAshes">Phoenix and Ashes</a></em>, based on Cinderella, has Allison, who uses her powers as a dark Earth Master to murder Eleanor's father for his money, before magically binding her to the house and forcing her to be a servant for Allison and her two daughters. She's also implied to have caused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSpanishFlu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSpanishFlu">the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic</a> to try and make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> last longer.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EllaEnchanted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EllaEnchanted">Ella Enchanted</a></em>, a retelling/send-up of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cinderella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cinderella">Cinderella</a>", has Dame Olga.

Wrede</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EnchantedForestChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EnchantedForestChronicles">Enchanted Forest Chronicles</a></em> features "The Right Honorable Wicked Stepmothers' Traveling, Drinking, and Debating Society", including the "Men's Auxiliary" which has a few Wicked Stepfathers, but is mainly for Wicked Uncles. In one book, when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> hero runs across a princess lamenting her exile in the forest, he concludes that she and her stepmother had cooked it up between them.
</li><li> An interesting spin happens in <em>The Golden Bowl</em> by Henry James (and the film it inspired of the same name). Maggie, the daughter of wealthy Adam, marries an impoverished prince, Amerigo. Maggie meanwhile thinks it would be a great idea to hook her widowed father up with her best friend Charlotte, thus making her best friend her stepmother. Neither Maggie nor Adam realizes, for a long time, that Amerigo and Charlotte are having an affair.
</li><li> Stepfather variety - in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HalfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HalfMagic">Half Magic</a></em>, the children are very nervous about their mother dating a man who keeps running into them on their magical adventures, mainly because they're worried he'll be like David Copperfield's Mr. Murdstone. They are finally convinced otherwise when he helps them sort out the next magical mess they get into, and even play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">Shipper on Deck</a> for himself and their mother. The sequel shows that he is, in fact, a very good father to them.
</li><li> In his essay collection <em>Happy To Be Here</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/APrairieHomeCompanion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/APrairieHomeCompanion">Garrison Keillor</a> wrote "My Stepmother, Myself", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a> of fairy-tale stepmothers, suggesting what happened to three famous fairy-tale heroines after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter">Happily Ever After</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowWhite">Snow White</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HanselAndGretel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HanselAndGretel">Gretel</a> regret that their relationships with their stepmothers were so sour (and Snow has to deal with the fact that Prince Charming could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILoveTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILoveTheDead">only get it up if she pretended to be dead</a>), while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cinderella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cinderella">Cinderella</a> now regards her stepmom as her new best friend; living in a palace where a phalanx of servants do everything for her, she finds that she misses doing chores for her stepmom.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHateUGive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHateUGive">The Hate U Give</a></em>. Seven <em>much</em> prefers his stepmom Lisa over his biological mom, calling her "Ma" and not correcting people when they assume she's his mother. Lisa did <em>much</em> more to raise Seven than his biological mother ever did, and loves him unconditionally, even though Seven exists due to a one-night stand his father (Lisa's husband) had with his mother. (Lisa absolutely <em>despises</em> Seven's mother, but loves Seven too much to take it out on him, and avoids slighting his mother while he's in earshot.)
</li><li> A rare male example in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightmaresAndDreamscapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightmaresAndDreamscapes">The House on Maple Street</a></em> — fortunately he gets <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">blasted into space when the house/spaceship launches.</span>
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianaWynneJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianaWynneJones">Diana Wynne Jones</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HowlsMovingCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HowlsMovingCastle">Howl's Moving Castle</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> characters know that stepmothers are supposed to be wicked, but the actual stepmother is only a little careless.
</li><li> Played with and zigzagged in "<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IKnowThisMuchIsTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IKnowThisMuchIsTrue">I Know This Much Is True</a>" Ray, Dominick's stepfather is stern and even physically abusive. He is very much seen as the evil cillian ruining their family while Dominick is a child. But towards the end of the book, when Dominick is in his forties, he actually comes to begrudgingly appreciate Ray for supporting and Raising two kids that aren't his. Even as an adult, after his mother has died, Ray continues to be there for him when he really needs help.
</li><li> The evil aunts Spiker and Sponge in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JamesAndTheGiantPeach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JamesAndTheGiantPeach">James and the Giant Peach</a></em> are basically this to young James when they take him in after his parents' deaths. They treat him like a servant and keep him locked away from the public after the peach turns into a tourist attraction.
</li><li> Mrs. Reed from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JaneEyre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JaneEyre">Jane Eyre</a></em>, while technically an aunt, still qualifies as an evil stepmother. Not only does she play the part, she is Jane's aunt by marriage, and thus not a blood relative.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KingdomOfLittleWounds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KingdomOfLittleWounds">The Kingdom of Little Wounds</a></em>, given it is a fairy tale. Ava gets on well with her stepmother Sabine.
</li><li> Inverted with Jagodas stepmother in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KronikiDrugiegoKregu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KronikiDrugiegoKregu">Kroniki Drugiego Kręgu</a></em> series. Nocny Kwiat is caring and supportive of her stepdaughter. Jagoda's biological mother was a cold-hearted bitch, who neglected her child and even physically abused her on the one occasion.
</li><li> Conversed in British statesman Lord Chesterfield's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LettersToHisSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LettersToHisSon">Letters to His Son</a></em>, as a metaphor for the dawning American Revolution. "For my part, I never saw a froward child mended by whipping; and I would not have the mother country become a stepmother." (letter 283)
</li><li> Inverted in Denise Skelton's <em>A Life of My Own</em>, where the stepmother, Liz, is the protagonist, and she is mistreated by her husband and tormented by her two ungrateful stepdaughters.
</li><li> Multiple characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLunarChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLunarChronicles">The Lunar Chronicles</a></em>, as you would expect from fairytale retellings.
<ul><li> Cinder's adopted mother Adri verbally abuses Cinder, mostly for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">being a cyborg</a>, and uses her as the family's sole source of income, rather than get a job herself. Worse, she is allowed to do all of these things because Cinder essentially is her property due to the cyborg laws.
</li><li> Though we have yet to see how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">Queen Levana</a> interacts with her stepdaughter Winter, considering she is the fairytale counterpart of the Evil Queen from "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowWhite">Snow White</a>" and her overall personality, it's safe to say she fulfills this trope.
</li><li> Sybil, one of Levena's minions, keeps her charge Cress locked away in a satellite.
</li></ul></li><li> Fanny Price's evil aunt Mrs. Norris in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MansfieldPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MansfieldPark">Mansfield Park</a></em> is her aunt by blood, and emotionally abusive to her. Fanny is lucky she doesn't live with her under one roof, but she visits them constantly. Mrs. Norris hates her for no reason and wishes her no comfort, but adores her other nephews and nieces who are a baronet's kids. (Fanny's parents are not dead, but she lives with her uncle the baronet.)
</li><li> A variation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Matilda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Matilda">Matilda</a></em> with Miss Honey's backstory where after her mother dies she is taken care of by her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaidenAunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaidenAunt">Maiden Aunt</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Trunchbull, who is also implied to have murdered Miss Honey's father</span>. Inverted with Matilda herself as her biological mother is the wicked one while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Miss Honey, her adoptive mother in the end</span> is kind and loving.
<ul><li> Subverted with the film. There were moments when Matilda's mother made sure Matilda knew what food was available to her. She even had a moment with Matilda when she wanted to be adopted by Miss Honey and voiced her regret of not spending time with her, but still signed the adoption papers because she knew it was for the best.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MercyThompson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MercyThompson">Mercy Thompson</a></em>:
<ul><li> Inverted hard by Mercy, she couldn't have a better relationship with her stepdaughter, Jessie. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf">Adam</a> wouldn't have married Mercy if it were otherwise. Jessie's biological mother, on the other hand, is a shallow, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">self-absorbed</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParent">negligent</a> twit who tries to use Jessie as a weapon against Adam. Jessie finally calls her out on this in <em>Fire Touched</em>, when her mom ended up endangering the entire Columbia Basin pack and tried to shift the blame on Adam.
</li><li> Played straight with Leah, Bran's wife, given that Bran effectively became Mercy's de facto father after her adopted father committed suicide. Leah is described as being an unpleasant bitch under the best of circumstances and hated Mercy from the start. This led to Leah becoming the victim of an ever-increasing prank war from Mercy.
</li></ul></li><li> Gender-inverted by Regine's stepfather from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MoreThanThis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MoreThanThis">More Than This</a></em>, an alcoholic who beat her and eventually caused her death.
</li><li> Subverted in the children's book <em>My Wicked Stepmother</em>; having grown up on these stories, the young protagonist is determined to consider his new stepmother a wicked stepmother, but she's actually a genuinely nice person who tries her hardest to win him over.
</li><li> In C. S. Lewis' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Narnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Narnia">Narnia</a></em> book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHorseAndHisBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHorseAndHisBoy">The Horse and His Boy</a></em>:

</li><li> Shasta, the boy of the title, runs away from an abusive caretaker who was going to sell him into slavery. Not technically a stepparent, but very similar.
</li></ul></li><li> Evil Stepfather turns up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ANightInTheLonesomeOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ANightInTheLonesomeOctober">A Night in the Lonesome October</a></em> — <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a priest of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos">Nyarlathotep</a></span> planning to sacrifice his stepdaughter to acquire supernatural power.

Also zig-zagged; while he and his wife have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentsAsPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentsAsPeople">realistic relationship issues and shortcomings as parents</a>, some of his alleged nastiness is hinted to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">dry sense of humour</a> that the children <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmBlind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmBlind">mistook for literal statements</a>, and he succeeds in improving his relationship with the kids after having a minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization">Jerkass Realization</a>.
</li><li> Inverted and discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOrphansTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOrphansTales">The Orphan's Tales</a></em>. Magadin's stepmother was wonderful and seemed to prefer her over her own blood daughter. Because of this, Magadins stepsisters became jealous and ratted her out to the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer">Evil Sorcerer</a>, when he came looking for young maidens to experiment on.

<ul><li> Percy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> stepfather, "Smelly" Gabe Ugliano. Percy's mother Sally only married him because Gabe's "mortal stench" helped hide Percy from monsters. Gabe proceeded to abuse Percy and Sally, and to squander the family's money on gambling and booze, until Sally got sweet, sweet revenge at the end of the first book.
</li><li> Subverted with his second stepdad, Paul Blofis, who is caring — even after finding out Percy's secret.
</li><li> Subverted with Annabeth's stepmom, who is <em>way</em> better than Annabeth describes. It might be a case of fear on her stepmom's part (which she eventually tried to get over), utter lack of parenting ability on her father's part, and a little kid's perspective plus several years of built-up bitterness on Annabeth's part. Once all parties were actually willing to work at being a stable family, they started getting along.
</li><li> Persephone. Little bit different in that Nico is the result of her husband having an affair with a mortal, as gods do, but Nico claims that she hates him. He can still use seeds from her garden to prolong his life in a "death trance", though.
<div class="indent"><strong>Persephone:</strong> <em>[coldly]</em> We had a little family spat. <br/><strong>Nico:</strong> Family spat? You turned me into a dandelion!
</div></li><li> Hera is an aversion, but only because she can be just as awful to her own kids. She drove Hercules insane so that he killed his wife and kids, but she also threw her own son, Hephaestus, off Mount Olympus for being ugly.
</li><li> A number of goddesses avert this though: Amphitrite doesn't shower Percy with affection, but she doesn't go out of her way to make his life unpleasant.

By Westeros's customs, Catelyn isn't a stepmother to Jon, but she is the wife of Jon's father. Additionally, Catelyn's children are Jon's half-siblings and share close sibling bonds with Jon, who is a loving and good-hearted boy like his siblings. While Catelyn is never exactly abusive towards Jon and does not heavily interfere in the bonds he has with his father and siblings, she is very cold to him and makes it clear she doesn't want him around. Catelyn resents Jon because he is not her child, but her husband's illegitimate son with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">another woman</a> (whom Ned will <em>not</em> identify), and because Ned brought Jon home as a baby, claimed him as his own son, and raises him at Winterfell alongside his trueborn children with Catelyn. Though Catelyn and Ned develop a loving marriage, Ned's love and protectiveness of Jon leads her to believe Ned must have loved Jon's mother fiercely and Catelyn fears she is living in the shadow of Ned's mysterious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLove">First Love</a>.

</li><li> The Dance of the Dragons had its root causes in a rivalry between Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen and her stepmother Queen Alicent Hightower. Their rivalry exploded into conflict when Rhaenyra's father King Viserys I died. The king had wanted Rhaenyra to inherit the throne, but the queen crowned her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen">eldest son instead</a>, and managed to rally support from several major houses.

</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SweetValleyHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SweetValleyHigh">Sweet Valley High</a></em> novel had the central character constantly being verbally and emotionally bullied by her stepmother, to the point where she would outright lie to the girl's father and tell him that she was being rude and disrespectful to her — and the jerk would believe her. Not until the girl saves her baby half-sister's life (she was choking on a button) does it finally dawn on the woman how horrible she's been. The stepmother not only apologizes but admits that she was trying to drive her husband's daughter away in order to have all of her father's attention to herself.
<ul><li> Two other books in the franchise feature this trope as a plot point, both with the same character. Said character is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddysGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddysGirl">Daddy's Girl</a> to her single father and has bad abandonment issues. The first book plays this trope <em>ridiculously</em> straight with her father's new girlfriend having only started dating him for his money and being absolutely horrid to the girl, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedTobeHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedTobeHappy">puts up with it for her father's sake</a> until the girlfriend leaves her alone for the weekend, prompting such a fit of nerves that the girl takes a nearly fatal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StaircaseTumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StaircaseTumble">Staircase Tumble</a>; her furious father breaks up with the girlfriend when the truth comes out. The next book has the father start dating the mother of a family that has a bad reputation and the man's daughter and the daughter of the woman already have a grudge against each other. Interestingly both of them have different ideas of how this trope will play out: the man's daughter just assumes that the "criminal" woman and her "delinquent" kids will ruin her and her father while the woman's daughter assumes that she'll become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">The Unfavorite</a>, not just for her mother and stepfather but for her beloved older brother as well (for his part, the brother has no problem with his mom's new boyfriend and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">is the only kid to see that nothing bad will happen</a>).

Genji is the son of the Emperor but can't be named a successor because of his low-ranked mother and his evil stepmother, Kokiden.

Played with in <em>The Sleeping Beauty</em>, where no fewer than three evil sorceresses try to enchant the king while he is still mourning his beloved wife; the local Fairy Godmother beats them to it and marries the king herself in disguise as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil">Obviously Evil</a> Wicked Stepmother. The next book <em>Beauty And The Werewolf</em> has it revealed that the heroine's stepmother avoided this fate (as much as her stepsisters avoided becoming wicked) thanks to her being a <em>busybody</em>. A rare occasion of a flaw saving people, though the heroine learns to calm down and calls herself out for being such a busybody when she realizes people really didn't need her being so controlling to have things work.

</li><li> In <em>Wintergirls</em>, Jennifer is a more nuanced approach to this trope. She does try to love her stepdaughter Lia but gets snappish with her when she thinks Lia is being even the tiniest bit of a bad influence on her own daughter Emma. This isn't completely unreasonable, given Lia's crippling anorexia and self-harming habit.

In a particularly petty move, Anne rechristens her fool, a dwarf, Mary.

A recurring theme in the show was the family trying to make the stepmother feel included so she'd stop hating them, and her clearly growing fonder of them (especially of her step-grandsons) and trying to fight that feeling so she could continue being evil.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Flashpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Flashpoint">Flashpoint</a></em> where a corporate robber was so desperate for an emotional connection that he falls in love with a teenage girl claiming that her stepfather was abusing her. What the robber didn't know was that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuyInRealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuyInRealLife">"girl"</a> was actually a teenage boy altering his voice and wanted his stepfather dead. But from what was seen, the stepfather at worst was neglectful due to his work.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>: While not abusive, Catelyn Stark makes it pretty clear to Jon Snow, her husband's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard">son by another woman</a>, that she doesn't want him around. Ned conceived Jon as the result of adultery and brought him home as a baby to raise alongside his trueborn children, resulting in Catelyn's unhappiness of this situation and prompting her resentment of the kid.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0qvf8');"><sup>From the books... </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0qvf8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0qvf8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Catelyn is also least slightly worried that he might have sons who would eventually contest her own grandchildren for the right to Winterfell, and thus strongly supports Jon's desire to join the Night's Watch, which would prevent this from happening. She fears Ned might have loved Jon's mother more than her — remembering how Ned was adamant that he raise Jon at Winterfell himself alongside the children she had with him — and this might be part of the reason why Ned loves Jon so. When she tries to ask about Jon's mother, Ned's reaction actually frightened her so much that she decided to drop the subject and wouldn't take her unhappiness about it out on him. In the third book, when she reflects on how fiercely protective Ned was of Jon, she again wonders about Jon's mother, wondering if Jon's mother prays for him just as she prays for Robb but resigns herself to never knowing who Jon's mother was.</span> Catelyn comes to regret her dislike of Jon after all the tragedy that befalls her, believing that it was karmic retribution for betraying the promise she made to love him, a bargain she made with the gods so that Jon would live when he became very ill as a baby. In the Season 6 finale, it's revealed that Catelyn wasn't so much Jon's wicked stepmother as his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">wicked aunt; Lyanna Stark is Jon's mother and Ned is Jon's uncle. After Lyanna died following childbirth, Ned adopted his nephew Jon, raised and loved him as his own, and passed Jon off as his own illegitimate child to protect Jon from Robert Baratheon's wrath. Catelyn may have acted very differently if she'd known Jon was her nephew instead of a child her husband conceived with another woman as a result of infidelity; unfortunately, by the time the truth is known, Catelyn has already been killed.</span>
</li><li> Tracy Quartermaine starts out as this to Lulu Spencer, even being called "Stepmonster" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GeneralHospital" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GeneralHospital">General Hospital</a></em>, but the trope is slowly subverted as the two get to know each other. Tracy even asked Lulu to be her maid of honour at her wedding to Luke, and Lulu told Tracy she was honoured to have Tracy as a stepmother.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gotham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gotham">Gotham</a></em>, Oswald Cobblepot finds his biological father, Elijah Van Dahl, soon after losing his mother.

They try to get rid of him by revealing his past as a criminal (Oswald already told him <em>willingly</em>), and Elijah's only reaction is that Oswald <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultBackfire">was too modest about himself.</a> Then they try to poison Oswald's drink... and Elijah drinks it instead. After the funeral, they decide to keep him as a maid, and plan to later fake his "suicide". This ends up destroying them, as Oswald finds the poison, snaps out of his brainwashing, murders and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IateWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IateWhat">cooks his step-siblings, feeds them to his stepmom</a>, and finally stabs her to death with a kitchen knife.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GrandHotel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GrandHotel">Grand Hotel</a></em>, Gigi was Beatriz Mendoza's best friend, but when Beatriz died, Gigi wasted no time moving on her husband Santiago, who just happened to be the owner of a gorgeous hotel. Santiago's children Alicia and Javi have never warmed to her, or her two daughters Carolina and Yoli.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HerculesTheLegendaryJourneys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HerculesTheLegendaryJourneys">Hercules: The Legendary Journeys</a></em>, Hera, Queen of the Gods, acts as this towards her husband's bastard son Hercules. This is in keeping with original myths of their relationship, as Hera was responsible for the majority of hardships the hero faced in his life.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> episode "Abandoned", we learn Shannon is how she is partly due to her stepmother, who cuts her off after Shannon's father's death. Like many tellings of "Cinderella", this is stated to be due to her jealousy of Shannon's relationship with her father.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen">Mad Men</a></em>, flashbacks to Don Draper's (or Dick Whitman as he was known back then) childhood reveal that his stepmother, Abigail Whitman, was a horrible maternal figure, referring to him as a "whore-child" (she only took him in because all her children up until that point had been stillbirths). It's telling that when Don learns of her death, his response is "Good".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren">Married... with Children</a></em> subverted the trope in the story arc where Al left Peggy and she dated a rich man. The reason Bud and Kelly considered him wicked? He wanted them to get jobs and be independent.

</li><li> Played with on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Revenge">Revenge</a></em>- although not technically Amanda's stepmother, Victoria was deeply in love with Amanda's father, David, and planning to run away with him to start a life together. She instead frames him for terrorism and institutionalizes Amanda to protect her own interests. When Amanda returns to the Hamptons as Emily, Victoria forms an antagonistic and abusive relationship with her almost-stepchild, believing her to merely be her almost-daughter-in-law.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StepByStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StepByStep">Step by Step</a></em>: Somewhat averted, in that there are no major issues between the stepparents and their stepkids, even if the transition is not as smooth as <em>The Brady Bunch</em>. However, there are some major points of contention:
<ul><li> Frank's only daughter Al has a difficult relationship with stepmother Carol in the beginning when Al objects to Carol's obsessive orderliness. It gets to the point where (in an early episode) she threatens to move in with her grandmother or find her biological mother. Al relents by episode's end and realizes Carol will do fine filling the void left behind when her biological mother chose to leave.
</li><li> Dana, Carol's eldest, has issues with both stepbrother J.T. and stepfather Frank. Dana and J.T. rarely get along, especially in the early years, and freely trade insults; this is due in part to being schoolmates, and already disliking each other even before their parents married. As the series continues, they develop a grudging mutual respect and willingness to help each other. As for Frank, Dana initially regards him as an oaf, but gradually comes to appreciate him.

<ul><li> Averted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a>, who had a kind, pious, and all-around good stepfather in Joseph the carpenter. Joseph is deserving of extra praise since he was Mary's <em>first</em> husband, and Jesus was conceived (virginally by God) while Joseph and Mary were <em>engaged</em>. (Even worse: in that time and culture, "engaged" was "married but not living together yet.")
<ul><li> In Jewish custom of the time, marriages were consummated a year later. So, when Mary turned up pregnant, Joseph had every right to consider divorcing her. Fortunately, they both got the news of Who had fathered the child.
</li><li> Emphasizing Joseph's kindly character, before Gabriel told him how Mary got pregnant, he was planning to hush everything up, and <em>not</em>, for example, to denounce her publicly. This was <em>very</em> generous of him because, in that time and place, she could have been found guilty of adultery (see above), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorRelatedAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorRelatedAbuse">the punishment for which was execution</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ramayana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ramayana">Ramayana</a></em>, Rama is exiled from the kingdom as a result of plotting by Kaikeyi, who's not his mother but another one of his father's wives.
<ul><li> Sort of subverted, though. Kaikeyi was under a spell, and after Rama is exiled she spends the next five years fasting, praying, and repenting for her actions, so when Rama returns, she is nearly unrecognizable.

</li><li> Svipdag, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a>, was sent on a quest by his wicked stepmother.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology">Hera</a> sort of personified this trope. Hercules/Heracles is already mentioned, but Zeus' other godly and demi-god offspring, who were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves">quite numerous</a>, tended to face similar treatment. Her actions ranged from simple murder to transforming the children into mindless beasts and driving them and those around them into madness. The fact that Zeus is Hera's brother also makes her an Evil Aunt to all these children.
<ul><li> A notable example was Hera's harassment of Leto, mother of Apollo and Artemis. While Leto was still pregnant with Zeus' progeny, Hera cursed Leto so that no land would accept her and set a serpent to stalk her in the oceans. Zeus had to set an island adrift so the serpent would finally stop chasing her.
</li><li> It should be noted however that Hera usually did not actually fulfill the part of step-<em>mother</em> since the mothers of the children in question in most cases stayed alive long enough to raise their children or they were given away to other people to raise. Only in two or three cases did Hera actually act as a stepmother proper: When Alcmene abandoned the infant Heracles to placate Hera's wrath, Hera ended up nursing the baby (it's usually described as by deceit and trickery). And before that she had also nursed the infant Hermes, with whom she got along fairly well afterwards. Hermes' birth mother, the minor goddess Maia, was also one of the few of her husband's paramours whom Hera did not give trouble and who even was able to protect Arkas, Zeus' son by Callisto, from Hera's wrath. Hera also teamed up with Athena in aiding the Achaeans against the Trojans during the Trojan War in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIliad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIliad">The Iliad</a></em> (though Athena has the advantage of generally being born to Zeus's wife before Hera, and was not the result of Zeus having an affair). Finally, Hera also raised Thetis as a kind of adoptive daughter.
</li></ul></li><li> Chinese exemplary tales of filial piety feature many wicked stepmothers.
<ul><li> <em>The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars</em> included Shun, who was protected by Heaven from the usual abuse; Min Sun, who pled with his father to not divorce the stepmother who had failed to dress him warmly, because if he did so, his brothers would also be neglected; Wang Xiang, who melted ice in winter with his own body in order to catch a carp for the stepmother who had abused him to his father and caused his father to stop loving him; and Zhu Shouchang, whose mother was driven off by his stepmother.
</li><li> Another such tale includes the righteous stepmother of Qi. When her son and stepson were found by a murdered man, and both confessed in an obvious attempt to shield each other, she said they should execute her son — both because her husband had particularly put her stepson in her care and because it was the place of her son, who was the junior and therefore inferior. (For which devotion to duty both men were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePardon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePardon">pardoned</a>.)

They remove her disguise, then fight her; when the Professor appears, Sedusa uses the Ima voice without the disguise and the Professor gets the girls to phone the police.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PoundPuppies1980s" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PoundPuppies1980s">Pound Puppies (1980s)</a></em>:
<ul><li> Katrina was evil to Holly, despite being her aunt. "Aunt" or "uncle" can be used as a term of endearment to an adoptive parent, which is probably what the show meant.
</li><li> The cartoon even has a "Cinderella" parody featuring a Fairy <em>Dogmother</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em>:
<ul><li> Chuckie imagines that Kira will be evil, complete with a Cinderella-esque <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamSequence">Dream Sequence</a>. Kira subverts the trope not only by being very nice but also by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyAdopted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyAdopted">legally adopting Chuckie</a> in the same episode.
</li><li> But <em>almost</em> played straight with Coco <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">LaBouche</a>. Fortunately, Chuckie's dad noticed how "wicked" she was just in time to dump her at the altar. It took the babies escaping from being locked up in a storage room, piloting a Mecha-Reptar Stu had built, and Angelica spilling the beans as payback for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCakeIsALie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCakeIsALie">The Cake Is a Lie</a> incident that pressured Coco into confessing that she's only doing it to keep being a Reptar franchisee. It gets worse for her naturally; the creator of Reptar was discreetly attending the wedding.
</li></ul></li><li> Used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em> 's season 3 arc about Stella's dad planning to marry an evil countess, who was evil even <em>before</em> she made the deal with Valtor. Quite a few fans complained about the show resorting to such an old chestnut, and the fact that the plot unfolded in an almost completely predictable (and uninteresting) manner didn't help matters either.
</li><li> Completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averted</a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a>,</em> to the extent you have to pay close attention to <em>notice</em> that Linda and Lawrence qualify as "stepparents" to any of their children. All three of them call both parents "Mom" and "Dad."
</li><li> Referenced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether">Drawn Together</a></em>, where Clara (being based on the Disney Princesses) has an evil stepmother who cursed her privates, turning them into a hideous tentacled monster.
<ul><li> And then, of course, Clara has a heartfelt discussion with her stepmother where it's revealed Clara rejected her first because she thought she was trying to replace her dead mom, and the stepmother cursed her because Clara never gave her a chance. They air their grievances, her stepmom tells her how to break the curse, Clara moves on past her mom's death, and their relationship is mended. Naturally, this is all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> because it's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether">Drawn Together</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WheelSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WheelSquad">Wheel Squad</a></em>, where Mr. Rotter, the only character who qualifies as somebody's stepparent, treats his stepdaughter Emilie like a real daughter. Even in the Cinderella parody, he was just strict and punishing her for a prank that could have gotten herself and her victim seriously hurt (and for not keeping satisfactory grades).
</li><li> Bart's teacher, Edna Krabappell, was dating Ned Flanders in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>. Not liking the idea of having her as a neighbor, Bart tried to make Ned's sons, Rodd and Todd, afraid she'd be a Wicked Stepmother who'd force them to do all the household chores. It backfired because Rodd and Todd enjoy doing them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SofiaTheFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SofiaTheFirst">Sofia the First</a></em>: Queen Miranda <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades the trope</a> by acknowledging there aren't many fairy tales with the good and loving kind of stepmothers. However, she strives to be one to her stepchildren.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em>'s TV movie "Is It Fall Yet?," <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSnarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSnarkKnight">Daria</a>, having been forced to work at a summer day camp, mentors a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MouthyKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MouthyKid">Mouthy Kid</a> named Link. At one point he quips that his mother "threw his father out for being a jerk, and then went and married a <em>bigger</em> one." We never actually see any of the adults involved, though.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted">Subverted</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde">Brittany</a>'s family; her dad married a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrophyWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrophyWife">Trophy Wife</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdoptivePeerParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdoptivePeerParent">only ten years older than Brittany herself</a>, and the two enjoy a happy sisterly relationship.
</li></ul></li><li> This is how Bean views Oona in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Disenchantment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Disenchantment">Disenchantment</a></em>. In all fairness, Oona never really made much of an effort to get close to her aside from Bean's failed wedding day. However, given that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Oona was actually a political marriage and not one made for love</a> she is shown to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">take a fantastical drug most of the time when her husband, son, and stepchildren aren't around</a>, it's not hard to understand <em>why</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">That said, when Season 2 rolls around Bean does reflect on this and admit that she judged Oona way too harshly when she learns what her biological mother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilQueen">is</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoneyTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoneyTrap">actually</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">like</a>...</span>
</li><li> As of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OKKOLetsBeHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OKKOLetsBeHeroes">OK K.O.!
