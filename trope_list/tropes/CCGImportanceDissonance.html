<p></p><ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> CCG, there are various filler Ninjas that were once staples in some decks, such as Suien.
<ul><li> For a long time in the game, the second most powerful card ever printed was the Third Hokage, often revered as perhaps the strongest ninja the leaf village <em>ever</em> produced, who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">dies in an epic battle by summoning <em>the god of death</em> to defeat his opponent</span>,. The first? Ino Yamanaka, a low-level genin that does almost nothing in all of part 1.
</li><li> Many recent sets have introduced multiple filler ninjas in order to try and give the decks more variety in what ninjas they can play.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> has countless examples of this trope.
<ul><li> The famous <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Blue-Eyes_White_Dragon">Blue-Eyes White Dragon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a 3000 ATK monster that requires two Tributes (monsters removed from the field) and has no effect; in the manga, it was powerful enough that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney">Seto Kaiba</a> resorted to extortion and theft to collect every last one of them, but in the TCG that ensued, it's merely an expensive target. Likewise, Yugi's signature card, the <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Magician">Dark Magician<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which requires two Tributes but has only 2500 ATK; arguably, it's received more support cards in later years than even the Blue-Eyes White Dragon could ever hope for, but it too is a white (black?) elephant, even if you're dedicated enough to theme an entire deck around him (and it's not even the strongest Normal Monster Spellcaster as his flavour text claims; Cosmo Queen has 2900 ATK). Not that <em>all</em> famous cards get this treatment, however; the very first duel featured in the manga included <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Summoned_Skull">Summoned Skull<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a powerful and incredibly playable card for many years (2500 ATK, like the Dark Magician, but it only needs <em>one</em> Tribute), and <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Monster_Reborn">Monster Reborn<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a powerful card that spent some time on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Forbidden List</a>: it allows the player who uses it to bring back a monster from the Graveyard. <em>Either player's</em> Graveyard. Many of the most powerful cards, in fact, have either never appeared on the show or appeared only briefly. Nowadays it's not uncommon for each new expansion set to feature cards for an entire new deck archetype, which typically dominates the field for about 3-6 months before a new expansion renders it utterly moot: these archetypes are often based off of the decks of one-shot characters, or minor recurring ones, rather than the main protagonists.
<ul><li> Many of the more popular cards of the early anime, however, have instead become centerpieces to decently viable to near-staple level archetypes, meaning that while fairly weak on their own, they work well in a dedicated deck. Blue-Eyes and Dark Magician being the primary examples of this. A dedicated Blue-Eyes deck (with the release of new Blue-Eyes support in 2016), managed to win the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentPlay">WCS</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> A particular case of a minor character's deck becoming suddenly very powerful: Girag, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL">Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL</a></em>, was a secondary villain, and of his Main Deck monsters, we only ever saw a few even use their effects, only appearing for a few seconds to be used as material for his ace. Obviously, this made his cards a low priority, and so barring his ace, they weren't released until after ZEXAL had already wrapped up. But by then, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a> had started to set in, and so the Hand monsters he used ended up getting significantly buffed to make them equal to the other cards in the set - leading to Girag's archetype having more tournament success than any of the other villains in his series!
</li><li> This is, of course, ignoring the cards that are straight-up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">Nerfed</a> from their anime counterparts. Pretty much every time the anime writers invent a card, when it gets turned into a real card, the designers tone it down to fit into the actual game... and then they tone it down some more. An infamous recent example was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV">Pendulum Magicians</a>, every one of which to debut in the anime has gotten a <em>massive</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">Nerf</a> to the point of unplayability, while the ones to debut in the game wind up being almost universally better. Which perhaps wouldn't be so irritating if they weren't the cards used by the main protagonist. In some cases, the card even bears almost no resemblance to its original form.
</li><li> If you play the card game as they did in the show originally (meaning, no sacrifices unless the card specifically says so), then Blue-Eyes is ungodly powerful in terms of straight beatdown. The rules of the real game are based on the second half of the Duel Monsters-era comic, the Battle City Arc; there's a reason that Kaiba relies less on Blue-Eyes White Dragon than on <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Blue-Eyes_Ultimate_Dragon">Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Obelisk_the_Tormentor_(original)">Obelisk the Tormentor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, or <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/XYZ-Dragon_Cannon">XYZ Dragon Cannon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in that Arc, even though it's still his signature card and end-all-be-all answer to many duels.
</li><li> There is also something to be said about the lore of rarity in the comic. Originally, stars indicated levels of rarity, in a very overt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerEqualsRarity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerEqualsRarity">Power Equals Rarity</a> way. Blue-Eyes White Dragon, for instance, is a level 8 monster, and only FOUR COPIES existed in the entire game. Level 7s were presumably also extremely rare, with probably only a handful existing in their own right (Kaiba was notably shocked when Yugi played Summoned Skull, at the time a Level 7 monster). This would explain why completing Exodia had "never been done before!" - if there were literally only a dozen or so "Exodia the Forbidden One" cards, and all the other pieces were equally as rare, the chances of ANYONE actually owning all five, let alone drawing them in a single game, was astronomically low. And, as most players were shown to only control level 1 through 4 monsters (which were presumably topped out at around 1200 attack, given the star levels originally shown), most would have only heard RUMORS of unbelievably rare cards like Red-Eyes Black Dragon, Summoned Skull, Dark Magician, and Blue-Eyes White Dragon, which could end the game in one attack (remember players originally had only 2000 LP, so one hit from a Blue-Eyes if you had a face-up 1000 Attack monster - a presumably otherwise-decent monster), and only a tiny cabal of people even knowing that something as gamebreakingly-powerful as Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon even existed. However, it's an <em>abysmal</em> business model. If there really <em>were</em> only four Blue-Eyes White Dragon cards in existence AND they were legal, they would each cost thousands upon thousands of dollars, because someone who had even one in their deck would have a monster that literally no-one else could actually beat in a head-to-head battle, which would quickly kill the allure of the game, not to mention the problem of only a handful of players being able to use the cards from the show. Instead, in real-life, such iconic and powerful cards were made commonplace.
</li><li> Cards that make cameos from other Konami franchises, which in their respective series are usually the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> or the hero, often find themselves dramatically underpowered. As an example, the <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Victory_Viper_XX03">Victory Viper XX03<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius">Gradius</a> and its counterparts, each of which is capable in-game of taking down an entire army including several nigh-invincible warships IN A ROW, are reduced to poor to mediocre monsters with decent effects that require them to have been powered up in the first place to use. Given that the game also includes an archetype capable of dropping monsters just as powerful as the aforementioned Blue-Eyes White Dragon, which are also an insta-nuke to the rest of the field.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a>, it's double-subverted with the Signer Dragons. In the series, they're treated as legendary divine servants, one of a kind and an ace in their own right. The in-game Signer Dragons vary quite a bit in power (Blackfeather Dragon is pretty lame, Red Demon's Dragon is a decent beatstick, Power Tool Dragon is an alright card <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUpLetdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUpLetdown">until it evolves</a>, Black Rose Dragon is a very nasty surprise, Stardust Dragon is a near-staple, and Ancient Fairy Dragon was banned), but bar maybe AFD (which is, ironically, treated as one of the weaker ones), none of them are quite the insane legendary cards they're usually hyped up to be. Their main advantages are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">splashability and ease of Summoning</a>; none of them have super-high stats, and none of them really have the firepower to win a Duel on their own (unless you count the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">upgraded versions</a> of Stardust and Red Demon's).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL">Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL</a></em>, all the Numbers have their "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakesOneToKillOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakesOneToKillOne">can only be destroyed in battle by another Number</a>" effect removed. This is pretty obviously because the Numbers would be a bit too unbalanced otherwise. One card, Number Wall, even adds the effect back in while it's active.
</li><li> The Egyptian God Cards from the original series were eventually made into tournament-legal cards for the game. All of their effects were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">Nerfed</a> in some way, but the nerfing was done more than proportionately to the cards' power in the manga and anime, meaning that Obelisk the Tormentor, which was the <em>weakest</em> of the Gods originally, became the most useful in the real game, whereas the Winged Dragon of Ra, which was the most powerful originally, became the weakest, to the point that its main strategy in the anime was now straight-up unusable. Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> when Ra Sphere Mode was released as a separate card to support it. In the anime, Ra Sphere Mode was literally worse than useless, consisting of Ra being stuck in half-shift in the hands of an unworthy user and unable to do anything. On the other hand, the real Ra Sphere Mode is considered to be the only reason that the standard Ra is worth playing, since it initially summons itself to the opponent's field (eating up three of their monsters in the process), then switches control to you and turns into the standard Ra with a free attack boost. Many players even ignore Ra entirely and <em>just run Sphere Mode.</em>
</li><li> Nerfing happens regularly between the anime and the game. The Eye of Timaeus is another infamous example; in the anime, it could potentially fuse with <em>any</em> Monster to create a game-winning super-dragon, though it was mostly used in tandem with Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl. When its real-game counterpart finally came out, it could <em>only</em> fuse with those two cards, turning it from a universal support card to a pretty weak one for a single archetype. (Then again, expressing its anime effect in the real game would be completely impossible.)
</li><li> An odd case is in an individual <em>character's</em> Deck. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a>,</em> one of the main characters, Crow, uses Black-Winged Dragon as an ace card and it's repeatedly emphasized that Black-Winged Dragon is the servant of a God and his best card. This is despite the fact that, prior to using Black-Winged Dragon, he often played Blackwing Armor Master, which was considered to be an extremely strong card for its time, while Black-Winged Dragon is a near <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JunkRare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JunkRare">Junk Rare</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KazukiTakahashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KazukiTakahashi">Kazuki Takahashi</a> actually lampshaded this in the author's note of the twelfth volume of Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist, saying "There's one problem when trying to express the fun of card games in manga form. In a real card game, the closer the players' skill levels are, the more fun it is... but in a manga, you need to show how the main character can beat overwhelmingly powerful opponents. So don't be mad if the score or effects of the cards in are different from the official card game version."
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPokerEquation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPokerEquation">Magic Poker Equation</a> is another factor that can make identical cards seem stronger in the anime and manga than reality; the fictional players don't have to rely on blind luck to draw the cards that make up their strategy, so cards and combos that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> in real life can be more reliable in fiction.
<ul><li> This, then, results in the main characters' cards having a distinct lack of focus as opposed to the greater specialization in the decks of most other Dueling characters. Not helping matters is how the protagonists tend to use increasing numbers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands">cards that are specifically for a particular situation</a> and never show up again. Yugi's Deck suffers from it worst: despite him being the King of Games and his Deck looking like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades">Jack-of-All-Trades</a> to let him contend with any opponent, the contents of his Deck are a mishmash of cards that don't gel together very well outside of what can only be possible in the anime, putting the Deck <em>hard</em> into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">Master of None</a> territory in reality.
</li></ul></li><li> An odd case of this is with attack-blocking Traps. In the game proper, one of the first attack-blockers made was Waboku (can be activated at any time, protects all monsters from being destroyed and reduces all damage to 0 for the turn), and there are many cards that arguably beat it out since then (Threatening Roar, which blocks all attacks for the turn, the Mirror Forces, which wipe out the opponent's monsters when they attack, and a mess of others). However, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">Rule of Drama</a> dictates that it wouldn't be very interesting for the opponent's attacks to do absolutely nothing for a turn, so supposed masters of the game have an odd habit of using cards that are basically Waboku but worse, either <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Card_Defense">only blocking one attack<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Half_Unbreak_(anime)">not blocking all damage<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Hero_Spirit_(anime)">not saving monsters from destruction<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, or <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Soul_Shield">possessing heavy costs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The inversion of this is with drawing-related cards, which tend to be a lot more common and powerful in the anime compared to the card game (for basically the same reason - if the character can draw a lot, they can pull off more impressive strategies). One of the most infamously banned cards is one that lets you draw twice - imagine how overpowered something that lets you draw five or six times would be!
</li><li> This is also the case for many cards and archetypes that, within the lore of the actual game, are supposed to be very weak or very powerful. Constellar Sombre and Evilswarm Kerykeion supposedly killed a creator deity and helped recreate the universe, but they're Level 4s with middling ATK stats and are used in their archetypes as play-extenders rather than game-winning aces. The Danger!s are just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurCryptidsAreMoreMysterious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurCryptidsAreMoreMysterious">random cryptids</a> with no apparent special abilities, but generated such consistent FTK plays that they saw a ton of cards limited. And then there's the many instances of a card's in-universe upgraded form being worse than the original—just ask Exciton Knight, who loses his ridiculously potent quick-effect field-nuke and very generic requirements upon becoming a chosen holy warrior in favor of a less potent destruction effect and being locked to a specific archetype.
</li><li> This has even had the game do it to itself at times. The release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YuGiOhDuelLinks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YuGiOhDuelLinks">Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links</a></em> saw a lot of cards and archetypes generally seen as worthless suddenly rising to the top of the meta due to the game's power ceiling being a lot lower. Bacon Saver, for instance, was seen as pack-filler in its time because its effect was just a crappier version of Electromagnetic Turtle or Necro Gardna, but when ported to a game where those cards didn't exist, it suddenly became quite viable.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UltimateMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UltimateMuscle">Ultimate Muscle</a></em> Battle Card Game inverted this trope. Even though the 'translator' (or guy who decided to make this playable and semi-balanced) nerfed a few of the cards, the Legendary characters like Ramenman or Buffaloman were nearly impossible to beat with the common wrestlers like Gorgeousman!
</li><li> The short-lived <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InitialD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InitialD">Initial D</a></em> card game had a card for a <em>car stereo system</em>. In spite of the fact that stereo systems were never even mentioned in the original manga, anime, nor video game, and none of the characters are the type to ever give a crap about stereo systems.
<ul><li> Not to mention IRL, a stereo system is detrimental to racing, as it adds dead weight to the car and serves no useful purpose whatsoever. Unless you're trying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFastAndTheFurious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFastAndTheFurious">to attract women.....</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonballZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonballZ">Dragonball Z</a></em>:
<ul><li> Tapkar is a gag character during the World Games Saga whose in-show stint consisted of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">running around the ring really quickly and then getting tired</a>, but in Score's original <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> card game his card powers are so overpowered not only was he banned, they named a redemption after him.
</li><li> The still-limping (maybe crawling?) game community (as of 2011) discovered the Supreme West Kai, who only shows up in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashBack">Flash Back</a>, is far superior to all the older strategies.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WeissSchwarz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WeissSchwarz">Weiss Schwarz</a></em> is guilty of this in a narrativistic instead of mechanical way. This game runs on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a> versus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCute">Rule of Cute</a>; it tries to replicate the awesome (or heartwarming, or sad) moment of the licensed anime in its cards. To do that, it allows itself to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper">print several different version of the same characters</a>, even if it's just a minor or situational variation. The downside of this, owing to the limit of cards in each expansion, is that characters whose appearances are few and far between gets less cards and decks built around them are less versatile (if building such deck is even possible)— even if they are far more capable in-story than the spotlight-hogging main characters.
<ul><li> For example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a></em> trial has <em>5</em> variations of Saber as Character and 1 Saber-related Climax card, while Rider gets 1 Character and 1 Climax. This is despite Rider being the frickin' Alexander the Great (and all around awesome dude). Then again, it wouldn't really be <em>Fate</em> if Saber didn't get nine different variations.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Nanako in a Yukata</a> card is stronger than the 'Naoto' card. Except Nanako is the main character's 6-year-old cousin, whereas Naoto is a detective with a gun.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Silica</a> is another example of this. While in the anime she barely appeared for more than a few episodes and only appearing as one of Kirito's possible love interests, there's a whole entire set of her in both volumes of the series' respective boosters, which has been shown in tournaments to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> sometimes. Her signed card is priced at <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ideal808.com/catalog/weiss_schwarz_singles-sword_art_online_en/silicas_unyielding_trust__special_parallel_sp__saos20e051sp_english_edition/110428">$75<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and that's just her Level 0 variant!
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CardfightVanguard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CardfightVanguard">Cardfight!! Vanguard</a></em> usually averts the trope because the most powerful cards are also those depicting major lore characters. Perhaps the most notable exception is <a class="urllink" href="http://cardfight.wikia.com/wiki/Harmonics_Messiah">Harmonics Messiah<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a being of incredible power which converted a chunk of the invading Link Joker clan into non-hostile inhabitants of the planet Cray and is treated in near-deific terms by the lore, yet in game is a promo Stride with no effect.

<p></p><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> gets this at times:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> novels don't always reflect the in-game properties of the cards they represent, especially the pre-revision novels. In <em>Arena</em>, an Ironclaw Orc blocks a Grizzly Bear. The cards are Grizzly Bears and Ironclaw Orcs, both are two power and two toughness; the card of Ironclaw Orcs explicitly cannot block creatures of power greater than one. Benalish Hero, a common card with a weak one power and one toughness, is described in the story as one of the best, most elite fighters out there, having undergone some elite training, without explaining how this character would survive against opponents that are stronger in the game, which includes forest animals. The promotional "Sewers of Estark" card is an instant granting unblockability to an attacker or no damage to attackers if blocking, while the in-story location has nothing to do with blocking and would be better suited as a land card. In <em>Shattered Chains</em>, Dingus Egg and Nova Pentacle are used for teleportation, while the cards are about dealing and redirecting damage. There is also the Stone Brain, an artifact unique to the story that can take away one's spellcasting ability, described as a Living Artifact mistaken for a Mana Vault, which neither have the ability to do in the game. In <em>Final Sacrifice</em>, the Dragon Engine is a massive siege weapon, while the card has only three toughness. The Lord of Atlantis is an elemental sea god while the card is a merfolk. The Keldon Warlord in the story has power based on rage, while the card has power and toughness based on the number of creatures the player controls. Force of Nature is a nature based spell, giving greater mana and godlike power to the caster, while the card is a creature known for its high power and toughness, and instead of giving mana, costs more mana due a high casting cost and high upkeep cost.
</li><li> Planeswalkers used to fit this category almost by definition; since planeswalkers were near-gods and the players themselves were supposed to be planeswalkers, the designers felt it wasn't possible to represent them in-game at all. This had the unfortunate effect that a sufficiently-important character could not appear on a card at all, eventually leading to Wizards massively depowering all planeswalkers in the "Time Spiral" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a>. Between the depowering and the new "loyalty" mechanic (which allows for them to be driven away but not killed), it's generally expected that most sets will contain a planeswalker or two.
</li><li> And then there is <a class="urllink" href="http://wiki.mtgsalvation.com/article/Gerrard_Capashen">Gerrard Capashen<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Plot-wise, he is a pinnacle of ages-long eugenics plan formulated by Urza, a powerful and very intelligent Planeswalker. Gerrard was specially engineered as a "Super-Soldier", to fight the denizens of Phyrexia, also known as <em>The Nine Hells</em>. Gerrard also receives several whole sets of cards dedicated to his (and his skyship's) crew: Weatherlight Adventures (Which is the name of one of the expansions). His card? <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=209157">Utterly unremarkable<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Bonus points for the card flat-out losing to every other card representing opponents that Gerrard defeated or overcame in the novels.

</li><li> The series' main villain of many years, Yawgmoth, also couldn't get a card printed depicting him because he was so powerful that a large group of old-style planeswalkers (mages powerful enough that they could create their own planes of existence if they wanted to-new-style planeswalkers are <em>substantially</em> weaker) armed with soul-powered nukes could only barely defeat him after hitting him with a weapon forged from Urza's thousands of years of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">planning</a> on Urza's part. Several cards depicting aspects of Yawgmoth have been printed over the years, including <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=15193">Yawgmoth's Bargain<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=5629">Yawgmoth's Will<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which are well into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> territory. Given that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> states Yawgmoth is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead">Deader Than Dead</a>, it's unlikely the game's most iconic villain will ever be rendered in card form, even <em>if</em> it wouldn't be the equivalent of having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> as a Top Trumps card.
</li><li> The gods of Theros are tremendously powerful semi-physical incarnation of concepts that can be truly killed only by a mystical weapon forged by Purphoros. In game <a class="urllink" href="http://magiccards.info/query?q=Deicide&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname">deicide<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is surprisingly trivial.
</li><li> On the flip side, Theros also introduced the <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373512">Traveling Philosopher<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePiratesWhoDontDoAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePiratesWhoDontDoAnything">has no philosophical ability whatsoever</a>, but can kill a grizzly bear with her bare hands. Fans noticed and it became a minor meme.
</li><li> Ludevic is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> famous for the power and variation of his created monstrosities, but many were disappointed when after years of showing up through flavor text and his creations he appeared in person. Unexpectedly Blue/Red, he allows players to draw a card at the end of their turn if they've hurt someone other than you. The flavor connection is weak, most were hoping that Innistrad's most famous necro-alchemist would feature necro-alchemy in a clear fashion, and mechanically it's very underwhelming; not effective as an incentive not to attack you, and its ability is often easier for your <em>enemies</em> to exploit, as they can trigger it using any number of beneficial self-damaging cards while you have to be more aggressive.
</li><li> The Tarkir block gives us two versions of the character Zurgo, one a powerful warlord and one just some guy who rings a bell. The warlord is a mythic rare logically enough, but the version who's explicitly a nobody is still a rare. Just to pile on the Warlord is not a very good card, while the nobody became a red staple for as long as it was in standard.

Finding a faction with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extra</a> isn't the exception, but the rule. Toku and Bayushi Tangen were chump sacrificial characters when introduced. The former's daughter now leads the Scorpion Clan as a regent, and the latter's students now comprise the clan's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> troops.
<ul><li> In contrast, since storyline tournaments usually net storyline victory cards, balance demands <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep">Power Creep, Power Seep</a>. It's not uncommon for these victory cards to be utterly useless, or better for someone else's clan, or for a clan's repeated victories leading directly to them being utterly useless in subsequent sets.
</li></ul></li><li> As it turns out this also becomes inevitable to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shadowverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shadowverse">Shadowverse</a></em> thanks to the hundreds of available cards, and if you would also count <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">Gameplay and Story Integration</a> for cards and expansions derived from other games' lore.
<ul><li> Some players had been wondering why the basic Goblin card has 2 defense compared to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless">armor-wearing</a> Quickblader who has only 1 Defense.
</li><li> Some Granblue characters who start out having a rarity of SSR (highest rarity, denoted by a Gold border) from the RPG game became a Silver-rarity card in Shadowverse. One such example is Charlotta.

Contrary to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPower">Popularity Power</a> though, quite a few A tier heroes aren't as powerful as you'd hope, while a few B and C list heroes are pretty darn powerful and useful. Examples are:
</li><li> First generation Controller, a no-name villain who starts out super strong, but rather than get weak when damaged gains mind control.
<ul><li> Fire Lord, a minor herald of Galactus who was super powerful and insanely cheap to play.

In turn, entirely-human characters like Batman, Batgirl, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Green Arrow</a> and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Robin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Robin">Robin</a> can have higher Strength scores than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">superstrong</a> characters like Fatality, Aquagirl or Starfire.

<p></p><ul><li> There was a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNightmareBeforeChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNightmareBeforeChristmas">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a></em> CCG, briefly. They had cards for every item and background character in the movie - even ones that didn't have names (which the CCG was mostly comprised of) such as "Gift-Wrapping Elf" and "Ghost on the Left".
</li><li> While the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> movies portray heroes such as Boromir or Gimli as capable of successfully defeating dozens of Orcs or Uruks in a single fight, in the <em>Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game</em> most minions, including not only Nazgûls or Trolls, but about 98% of all "random nameless extra" Orcs, Uruks and Evil Men are stronger than the basic Fellowship members. Thus, the Fellowship has to arm itself with lots and lots of weapons and use various combat support to be able to win skirmishes. And even then, many wounds are taken.
<ul><li> The game suffered from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep">Power Creep, Power Seep</a> as well. In the first year of the game Fellowship members (and Arwen) were the strongest companions in the game, while various "random nameless extra" Elves and Dwarves had significantly lower stats and were used for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> rather than combat. Over time the distinction blurred and the Extras started receiving the same stats as the Heroes, though the Heroes still came with better abilities. And further down the road there came characters who, while important figures in Middle-Earth, only had seconds of screen time and yet were stronger than Aragorn, Éomer, or Gandalf.
</li><li> An interesting example comes from Glorfindel. He's a character who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">doesn't even show up in the film</a>, as most of his plot importance was given to Arwen, but in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">the source material</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExitMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExitMachina">he was actually excluded from the Fellowship for being too badass</a>. In the TCG, which is explicitly based on the films, he's one of the most powerful characters in the pre-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a> game.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsCustomizableCardGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsCustomizableCardGame">Star Wars Customizable Card Game</a></em> not only has mooks but also gives cards and brief bios for very minor characters, such as those only seen in the Mos Eisley Cantina. It also averted the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep">Power Creep, Power Seep</a> problem by issuing new versions of major characters, each with different situational talents. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FarmBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FarmBoy">Farm Boy</a> / Vanilla Luke was good at flying; "Commander Luke Skywalker" was adapted to life on Hoth; "Son Of Skywalker" got bonuses when undergoing Jedi training; etc. Amusingly, Decipher decided to treat "Senator Palpatine" and "The Emperor" as two separate people, one working for the Light Side and the other Dark, so opposing players can each control a version. But the game was cancelled before they could figure out how to deal with Anakin.
<ul><li> The same goes for the <em>Star Wars Miniatures</em> game; for a while, the best character in the game was Aurra Sing, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BountyHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BountyHunter">Bounty Hunter</a> who only made a brief cameo appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace">The Phantom Menace</a></em>. Booster packs often tended to frustrate buyers because each pack only contains one rare figure, and <em>all</em> named characters are rare or very rare regardless of importance. You were very likely to get some random cantina alien rather than fan-favorite characters from the movies.

<p></p><ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">Middle Earth</a> CCG was infamous for its "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante">Kuduk Lore</a>" — characters essentially created out of thin air by Iron Crown Enterprises to cover the apparent insufficiency of named characters. Many of these came from the Middle-Earth <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleplayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleplayingGame">Roleplaying Game</a>. Very few were anything to be proud of — the names they created for the Nazgûl were especially demoralizing. (Who wants to admit to playing a card named "Dwar of Waw"?) This is made even more galling because the Nazgûl's old names hardly mattered at all; they were little more than the will of Sauron by that point in the narrative. Their faceless malice was more terrifying than any of them could as named individuals. A card called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNumberSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNumberSix">Sixth of the Nine</a> fits the theme <em>and</em> would be far scarier. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0boua');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0boua" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0boua');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In fact, that's essentially what Decipher did with their own Lord of the Rings TCG, with each Nazgûl other than the Witch-King having a quenya name that translates to "Xth Nazgûl".</span>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos">Call of Cthulhu</a> LCG lets you play Cthulhu himself, and he can be killed. Granted, it's <em>very hard</em>, but...it still feels wrong.
<ul><li> Cthulhu is also available in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HeroClix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HeroClix">Horrorclix</a> as a chase "scenario" figure. A decent team can defeat him without too much trouble, yet still have trouble with a bunch of random serial killers.
</li><li> It should be noted, however, that in its first appearance Cthulhu was indeed defeated by a single man in a boat.

<p></p><ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> Top Trumps (original series) was mocked because the historical characters had to be beefed up for play balance, so you ended up with Joan of Arc being able to defeat a Sea Devil or suchlike.
<ul><li> The actual <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> CCG kind of inverted this; virtually all common cards were absolute unplayable rubbish and uncommons weren't much better. Most recognizable characters were rares, and the Fourth Doctor — at the time the most recognizable and iconic version — was an <em>ultra-rare.</em>
</li><li> The latest incarnation — <em>Doctor Who: Monster Invasion</em> — has a number of oddities. It helps if you reflect that the "Loyalty" statistic doesn't specify who they're loyal <em>to</em>, so while it's surprising that Rory's is higher than Amy's, maybe it reflects his loyalty to <em>her</em>. The fact Amy has a "Bravery" stat of 300, more in line with the average panicky extra than Martha's 600 or Sarah Jane's 750, is harder to explain. And there are a <em>lot</em> of cards devoted to panicky extras.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> CCG by Decipher actually cycled into and out of this trope. At first players only used named characters since the no-name Starfleet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirts</a> had usually only one skill and mediocre stats. To balance this out, they made cards called "Lower Decks" and "Assign Mission Specialist" so that these cards would see use. Also, since the game was premised on all the Star Trek races competing, every on-screen Romulan, Klingon and several other characters eventually got cards with skills and high ability scores never demonstrated on screen so that their faction had a viable chance at solving missions. Oh, and Riker's card sucked. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1m8wp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1m8wp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1m8wp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues">clone's, moreso.</a></span>
<ul><li> Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's unnamed cameo character is an ultra-rare card. There are about half a dozen ultra-rares in the entire game.
</li><li> The second edition of the game fixed this to some extent, leaning more on using multiple versions of main characters. Of course, it had four Trek series to draw from while the first edition kind of didn't.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Highlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Highlander">Highlander</a></em> CCG was a major offender here, as just about every Immortal from the films and TV series (except, High-Costing-Sean-Connery-Likeness-Rights-Required Ramirez) got a deck based around them over the life of the game. Many of the most powerful cards were one-shot wonder characters.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> CCG, two of the most frequently abused cards in the first set were an empty trunk and a random mausoleum.

<p></p><ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">Mechwarrior: Dark Age</a></em> game suffered badly from this in the first few sets. Battlemechs were supposed to be kings of the battlefield, but most of them wound up being fairly weak. A few squads of infantry or a vehicle or two could take down most mechs pretty quickly, even ones that were supposed to be quite powerful. This was because the stats of most units were generally done randomly instead of following some sort of attempt to convert them over from the original game. This also led to mechs being armed with long range weapons that had short range values, and thirty ton mechs that could easily take more damage than mechs more than twice their size.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy">Horus Heresy</a></em> CCG, one of several set in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> universe, tends to avert this. The more common cards are line infantry or support weapons, the uncommons are squads who play a named role in the backstory (including ones subsequently featured in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy">series of novels</a>), the rares are either infamous and power units or named and often pivotal characters and the very rares are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Primarchs</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Titans</a> and the actions of Horus or The Emperor. Similar to the Yawgmoth example for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>, actually having cards for these two characters would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">impossible to do so without breaking game balance</a>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> board game, the seventh quest is to recover the legendary Cloak Of Boccob from the shrine of a fallen warrior. The heroes fight through the largest single horde of monsters the game has thrown at them yet...and find an item that usually blocks one damage point, then has a fifty-fifty chance of being discarded every time it's used. It's a less powerful version of the Barkskin Cloak, a starting-level item card that you could randomly find in the first chest in the game.
</li><li> In the backstory for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SentinelsOfTheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SentinelsOfTheMultiverse">Sentinels of the Multiverse</a></em>, Revenant is a fairly important villain, as the CEO of the ominous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">RevoCorp</a> (which has a hand in numerous heroes' and villains' backstories) who has decided to take on superheroes directly in a robotic suit. In game, he's...a slightly-more important minion in another, bigger villain's deck. Zhu Long is similar, with a ton of backstory significance but no villain appearance save a minion card, although he at least got his own environment deck.
<ul><li> The Matriarch is one of the few difficulty 4 villains, an enemy on par with the likes of Progeny, whose attack redefined the setting, or the Chairman, the guy who made Rook City a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a>.

<p></p><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> CCG:
<ul><li> In the Video Game and Anime, Mewtwo was absurdly overpowered compared to every other Pokemon at the time (apart from Mew). Its first card was <em>terrible</em>, to the point its only real use was in a gimmick deck that tries to stall until your opponent runs out of cards.
</li><li> The evolution mechanic was too difficult to pull off in many cases meaning basic pokemon were often more valuable to put in a deck than their evolved counterparts. In the beginning they thought it was "balanced" to design cards that didn't have evolutions stronger because being able to evolve was an "advantage". The result was that Pokemon without evolutions were almost universally the strongest cards. Combine with the broken retreat mechanic and the colored energy and for a while Scyther of all cards was considered the strongest Pokemon since it had a decent colorless attack, good HP, and no retreat cost, making it an excellent card to simply throw into any deck. Eventually Sneasel came out even more broken, and despite being pretty unimportant in the source material it remains one of only three cards ever to be banned in the West for being overpowered (three others were banned for non-overpowered reasons, one for a translation error, one for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionalPowerlessPieceOfGarbage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionalPowerlessPieceOfGarbage">being in hieroglyphics</a>, and one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">that was more powerful on the user's birthday</a>). At the time, there was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nickname</a> (that saw great play in a number of magazines such as Pojo) for this type of card, named for Hitmonchan (who was essentially a prototype version of the Scyther discussed above). That nickname? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">Haymaker.</a>
</li><li> If anyone tried to bring Delcatty to a video game competition, they would be fighting some major uphill battles. In the Trading Card Game, however, Delcatty has historically been the greatest Energy recycler in the game, allowing it to have entered wide tournament use at least three times.
</li><li> One of the most useful cards in the TCG was Cleffa, a baby Pokemon with pitiful stats in-game. The TCG version had an attack that let you completely refresh your hand for 1 Energy (or 0 Energy in the remade version), and was very difficult to actually damage due to the Baby Rule. It got to the point where most competitive decks included specific cards to counter Cleffa, an idea that's laughable to video game players.
</li><li> Averted in terms of rarity. The super rare foil cards are usually legendary monsters like Mewtwo and Zekrom.
</li><li> And we go back full circle—the card to beat in the 2011-12 season was Mewtwo-EX. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pokémon Black and White</a> expansions seems to have made most Legendary Pokémon deliberately stronger and tougher, and the ones who didn't have been given competitive utility. For better or for worse, this means the Pokémon Trading Card Game is, in the 5th generation, an aversion to this trope.
</li><li> Charizard. While it's one of the most iconic Pokémon in the franchise, in the games it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a> leaning towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>; until its Mega Evolutions showed up, it was considered fairly unremarkable. In the TCG, it's consistently depicted as an extreme brute-force <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> with attacks that outdamage most Legendary Pokémon, and is designed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> akin to many "legendary" <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> monsters with high stats.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HearthstoneHeroesOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HearthstoneHeroesOfWarcraft">Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft</a></em> both uses and averts this trope. Many of the most powerful cards in the game are very well-known characters such as Sylvanas Windrunner, Alexstrasza and Tirion Fordring. Many of the most powerful and famous characters aren't represented on a card, but instead represent a character class (Medivh, Garrosh Hellscream, Anduin Wrynn, etc.) However, there are several cards that have power way above or below the level that lore would appoint them. Some examples:
<ul><li> Illidan Stormrage, one of the most powerful characters in all of Warcraft lore; rogue Demon Hunter who went toe-to-toe with Death Knight Arthas at full power and fought him to a standstill. In-game, his card is hilariously nonthreatening, and generally just makes a couple of tiny chump tokens before getting effortlessly killed. His original design was actually a lot more powerful and disruptive, but he turned out to be *too* good, so he was changed to his current form before the start of the Beta test.
<ul><li> Illidan was so poor, his minion was eventually removed from the game entirely and replaced with the mechanically identical but more lore-appropriate Xavius. Illidan himself was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable">Promoted to Playable</a> as the representative for the new Demon Hunter class.
</li></ul></li><li> Leeroy Jenkins, a goofy joke character from a viral video. For a long time he was one of the most dreaded finishers in the game, despite not even being a real character in the lore. He was actually so brutal that he received a nerf and was eventually banned from Standard format.
</li><li> Dr. Boom, a pop-culture parody character of Marvel Comics' Dr. Doom. In World of Warcraft he's a very easy joke boss that the player handles solo during some quests in a remote corner of the world. In Hearthstone, on the other hand, he's considered one of the most powerful and desirable cards in the whole game, since he has excellent value for his stats, is hard to cleanly remove and can easily go into almost any deck. For awhile it was just about guaranteed that your opponent was packing one of these bad boys. In fact, he was so infamous for his brokenness that he reached <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extra</a> status and got to be the star of his own <em>expansion</em>.
</li><li> Poor, poor Bolvar Fordragon. In the lore he's one of the coolest, most badass paladins of all time. Regent of Stormwind, commander of the forces that stormed Northrend, and so noble that he willingly chose to endure an eternity as the Lich King's vessel just to hold its evil in check. His card is hilariously bad, albeit very flavorful. He got a second chance in <em>Knights of the Frozen Throne</em>... and isn't much better there.
</li><li> Deathwing, the most powerful dragon in Warcraft lore, is a card with excellent stats... but discards your whole hand, leaving you without resources on your next turn. Considering how easily minions can be removed or killed in Hearthstone, this is generally considered a very bad deal.
<ul><li> Incidentally, the <em>Whispers of the Old Gods</em> set contains new versions of some of the most iconic characters, including Deathwing, which is much better than the original. He also got a third card printed in <em>Descent of Dragons</em> that isn't half bad and was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable">Promoted to Playable</a> as an alternate Warrior hero. Suffice to say, he got off better than most characters here.
</li></ul></li><li> A lot of the Legendary weapons from <em>Kobolds &amp; Catacombs</em> fall into this trap. For example, the Dragon Soul is one of the most powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffins</a> in <em>Warcraft</em>, being an artifact that contained the power of four of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Dragon Aspects</a>. In Hearthstone, it's an unimpressive Priest weapon that summons a 5/5 Dragon after a stingy requirement. Meanwhile, Kingsbane is a pretty unremarkable dagger in WoW (and after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">Retcon</a>, literally has <em>no</em> lore), but is arguably the best Legendary weapon of the set.
</li><li> Hearthstone even messes this up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalGeneration">Original Generation</a> characters. In <em>The League of Explorers</em>, Archthief Rafaam is a <span style="display:none">invoked</span><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> who defeats the team by himself while Reno Jackson is a bumbling and somewhat selfish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> archaeologist. Their effects and meta impact were basically the exact opposite: Rafaam has bad stats for his cost and lets you Discover an underwhelming 10-mana artifact, seeing next to no play, while Reno has a game-warping Battlecry that heals your hero to full health so long as your deck has no duplicate cards, redefining how Control decks were built for the entire time he was in Standard.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyRecordKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyRecordKeeper">Final Fantasy Record Keeper</a></em>:
<ul><li> To avoid confusing players, the developers usually try to use weapons without shared names for Soul Break relics. This sometimes results in unremarkable items in the original games becoming valuable items in this game. Most prominent is Hope's Ninurta: in <em>FFXIII</em>, it's a first-tier (out of three) weapon and widely considered to be one of his <em>worst</em> boomerangsand it's his <strong>Burst</strong> Soul Break weapon!
<ul><li> It happened again with Lightning. Her Burst Soul Break weapon was Overture, her iconic gunblade from <em>FFXIII-2</em>. Her Overflow Soul Break weapon? Gladius, another first-tier weapon and a wholly-unremarkable one for Lightning on top of that.
</li><li> Krile's Fire Lash, which was almost useless in FFV, contains the best magic buff in the game.
</li></ul></li><li> Echo got hit with this; despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyCompanion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyCompanion">Fairy Companion</a> to the main character of a <em>Final Fantasy</em> mobile spin-off, she got a Relic that endowed upon her a Soul Break that gave the entire party DEF and RES boosts <strong>and</strong> Hastega. Not to mention this ability could be stacked on top of pre-existing Soul Breaks such as Sentinel Grimoire, which had players scratching their heads at why a basically-unknown side character got one of the best Soul Breaks in the game. This was later rectified pre-release with a quick change that made the buff to be explicitly anti-MAG only, vastly reducing its viability.
</li><li> Danjuro, the strongest dagger in FFXII, is one of the weakest weapons in this game. It was released as one of the first 5*s and is now an obsolete off-banner relic. Meanwhile, the Orichalcum Dirk, a middle-of-the-pack dagger, contains Vaan's Burst Soul Break, widely considered the best in the game.
</li><li> Averted in some cases. Sephiroth's Masamune is weak and obsolete, but this was changed by the release of the Masamune-Shinuchu. It's the same sword, except with a Burst Soul Break and blood on its hilt.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em>, Platinum Sword is an unremarkable sword that comes in an awkward time and gets outpaced by Power Creep. Heck, if you're leveled up, you can skip it. In this game, it gives Ramza the infamous Shout SB, which singlehandedly obsoleted every other damage buff ability in the game and is thus one of the most sought-after weapons.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarOnline2es" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarOnline2es">Phantasy Star Online 2es</a></em>:
<ul><li> In-story, More is up there with the main characters, and is one of the three starting core members of the Darker Busters. In gameplay, More is the <em>weakest</em> Weaponoid in the game, handed to you for free and possessing a piddling attack buff with regen bonus.
</li><li> Aurora, in-story, is a <em>Photoner</em>, AKA the almighty precursors to the ARKS and who founded their existence, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">becomes a Genesis Weapon, one of the strongest weapons in the story.</span> Her Chip? A 12★ that adds a whole <strong>+20%</strong> to your damage, and for every three standard attacks you land, your damage goes up... by 500. Not 500<em>%</em>, just <em>500</em>. She easily beats pre-balance Salus Punisher as the worst 12★ to ever exist.
</li><li> Until Yamigarasu was introduced, no endgame player would be caught dead without Saga, whose status damage made him a staple in many endgame decks. In <em>PSO2</em>, Saga is a side character who exists as Katori's straight man and has zero plot relevance.
</li><li> Segami has more utility than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Neptunia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Neptunia">Purple Heart</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2r7v9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2r7v9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2r7v9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Segami's ability converts your highest Element total to the Element that your enemy is weak to. Purple Heart provides a +55% damage bonus and 6-8% regen</span>. This is despite the fact that Neptune/Purple Heart is <em>the main character of the franchise</em>, and Segami is from a crossover spinoff. <strong>Nepgear</strong> provides better damage than Neptune, and she's Neptune's younger sister!<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note379h3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note379h3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note379h3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Note that this would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperdimensionNeptuniaMk2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperdimensionNeptuniaMk2">the first time</a> Nepgear took the lead role from her older sister...</span>
</li><li> Arguably, Hatsune Miku was marginally less useful than Luka, back when Yamigarasu didn't exist<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4ifi6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4ifi6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4ifi6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Miku restores CP when a Just Attack connects. Luka grants Mirage affliction to normal attacks, which can be paired with Saga for high-damage combos</span>. Nowadays, Luka is useless due to Yamigarasu obsoleting status affliction Chips.
</li><li> Rina is a Game Breaker 12★, but in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PhantasyStarOnline2TheAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PhantasyStarOnline2TheAnimation">the anime,</a> she's more or less a love interest who spends half of her important scenes as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a>. Itsuki, who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">The Protagonist</a>, and Aika, who is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a secret agent from Oracle and Itsuki's connection to ARKS</span>, don't hold a candle to Rina's Chip in <em>es</em>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder8');">     Web Comics  </div><div class="folder" id="folder8" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<p></p><ul><li> The strongest card in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyArcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyArcade">Penny Arcade</a></em> deckbuilding game (and one of the strongest in any deckbuilding game) is Bat-milk, based on a one-panel gag in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2009/8/14">this comic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It's a cheap card that lets you reveal the next two cards from your deck, adding them to your hand if they're green (cash) or trashing them if they're red (combat). Since it is <em>itself</em> a green card, a few of them will very quickly leave you with a green-only deck that draws itself every turn for massive profit. The only real way to compete with a Bat-milk deck is with another Bat-milk deck, and the game is likely to just come down to who buys more before they run out.
<ul><li> In the same vein, in the first product ever released for the Universal Fighting System, the Penny-Arcade Battle Pack, Tycho overclassed Gabe by a mile as one of the strongest characters in the game, where Gabe is largely considered one of the worst.
</li></ul></li><li> Killer Robot Games' <em>Legendary Showdown</em> is a card game which draws material from three webcomics: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheAdventuresOfDrMcNinja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheAdventuresOfDrMcNinja">The Adventures of Dr. McNinja</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius">Girl Genius</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GunnerkriggCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GunnerkriggCourt">Gunnerkrigg Court</a></em>. While the <em>Dr. McNinja</em> cards are relatively accurate in terms of their relative power, the second edition cards (GG and GK) are much less consistent with their source material.
<ul><li> For example: Maxim, Oggie, and Dimo are all 5 point cards on a 0-10 pt scale (except for two 12-pt cards) despite being members of the super soldier race of Jaegars and shown to be much more dangerous than nearly every other Girl Genius character featured in the game.
</li><li> Meanwhile, Antimony Carver is a 9 point card, despite the fact that she is pretty weak compared to most other GK characters in the game as she is a rather thin teenage girl with little to no mundane combat training or experience using her fire powers in combat. She is very commonly shown to be outmatched when a fight breaks out in the comic.
</li></ul></li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder9');">     Western Animation  </div><div class="folder" id="folder9" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The short-lived <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> trading card game did this by flat-out <em>inventing</em> four different characters and then basing whole decks around them. Afiko, who betrayed the Airbenders in Aang's time, Malu, one of the last survivors of the Airbender purge, Kinto, a Waterbender who was banished for cruel pranks, and an earthbending bandit named Jojo were all created by Upper Deck and never appeared in any other media, despite early promotional material hinting they would show up in the TV series. All four have since been considered non-canon. In Upper Deck's defense, the card game was developed in the show's infancy and never went past season one, meaning some of the most popular characters never got introduced in time to make it into card form.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DragonBooster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DragonBooster">Dragon Booster</a></em> had a CCG, among a ton of other merchandise which sunk. Every character was named-but only a few were ones from the actual show. The rest were mainly crew members who were made up to fill out the ranks of the various racing crews.
</li><li> Most of the powerful cards in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> CCG are the Mane 6 themselves, but a few background characters stand out as unusually prominent. Most notable is probably Lady Justice, the (implied) daughter of the Mayor of Ponyville, who appears for three seconds in one musical number, but is a prominent part of many, many powerful decks. It's also worth noting that Mr Beaverton Beaverteeth (a beaver) is evenly matched with either Princess Celestia or Princess Luna in a face-off (the closest thing the game has to combat), and Big Macintosh can usually defeat both of them simultaneously.
