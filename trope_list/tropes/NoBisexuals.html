Although some series don't address any sexuality specifically, even gay characters tend to be more numerous.
</p><p>Almost any character in a same-gender relationship or professing a same-gender attraction is assumed by the others to be either gay or joking. If the existence of bisexuals is acknowledged, they're usually depicted as very promiscuous and totally defined by sex, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual">sometimes even as predatory</a> (mirroring prejudices leveled against real life bisexuals). A few characters do manage to use a version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">Ambiguously Gay</a> to avoid scrutiny (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourLesbians">Hide Your Lesbians</a>). A function of this is when a character who has been seemingly heterosexual until this point falls for a member of their own gender, they jump the fence and become <em>only</em> interested in their own gender from that moment on; the possibility that they might be bisexual is never even brought up.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The trope especially purports that there are no bisexual <em><strong>men</strong></em>, particularly in Western productions. Some female characters, due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOnGirlIsHot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOnGirlIsHot">Girl-on-Girl Is Hot</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweepsWeekLesbianKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweepsWeekLesbianKiss">Sweeps Week Lesbian Kiss</a> rules, can explore all sides of their sexuality as much as they want, especially if they're identified as promiscuous or plain evil. However, such characters will rarely call themselves bisexual; they may insist they're straight, or just leave it up in the air. Meanwhile, since male characters often act as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceSurrogate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceSurrogate">Audience Surrogate</a>, their sexuality has to be strictly heterosexual, lest the show be forced into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorityShowGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorityShowGhetto">Minority Show Ghetto</a>.
</p><p>This trope is, of course, not Truth in Television in the sense that bisexuals exist. It <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> in the sense that bisexuals have often been faced with disbelief from straight and gay people alike on the grounds they "have to be" one or the other. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, this phenomenon is occasionally called <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexual_erasure">Bisexual Erasure<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

<ul><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em> faces much controversy in the fandom regarding her sexuality, even though she spells it out in the first episode: "I don't care if it's a boy or a girl!" Being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander">Haruhi</a>, her main point was that she doesn't care about gender because she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance">space-aliens-and-supernatural-beings-sexual</a>. Kyon is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">probably</a> a normal human, and Mikuru <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">is not</a>, but as far as Haruhi knows they're both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle">muggles</a>; yet she behaves like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">tsundere</a> towards Kyon and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">Clingy Jealous Girl</a> towards Mikuru. It's a confusing situation.
</li><li> In the yuri manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IndigoBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IndigoBlue">Indigo Blue</a></em> the main character, Rutsu, is pretty clearly bisexual—though she prefers women, she admits to having had genuine feelings for her ex-boyfriend and to sometimes enjoying sex with men. However, her decision to accept her attraction to women and begin a same-gender relationship is consistently referred to as "becoming a lesbian" or "sinking into lesbianism", which not only avoids use of the term "bisexual," but implies it to be some kind of irreversible process (i.e. she can never go back to dating/sleeping with men now).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>:
<ul><li> The fifth <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> manga, called simply <em>STARS</em>, featured cross-dressing Sailor Senshi named the Sailor Starlights, and one of them, Sailor Star Fighter, has feelings of affection towards Sailor Moon. They are not a major part of the storyline, and Star Fighter only makes it clear in passing. But when this became a major part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">anime</a> adaptation, <em>Sailor Stars</em>, Star Fighter and the other Starlights became physical males in their civilian forms to keep Usagi from being seen as a maybe bisexual. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokoTakeuchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokoTakeuchi">Naoko Takeuchi</a> was not amused by this in the slightest, although she stopped short of disowning the anime. The anime itself only acknowledges this awkwardly in one scene where the Starlights' Princess asks Fighter "You take these forms on earth?" and Fighter nervously responds "To attract only women, this form was easiest".
</li><li> In the anime adaptation of <em>S</em>, Makoto has several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> moments with Haruka and seems to have an attraction to her, only for Usagi to tell her not to "abandon" men, as if Makoto being bisexual was never an option.
</li></ul></li><li> Minto from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew">Tokyo Mew Mew</a></em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBi">Ambiguously Bi</a>—she expresses a rather excessive admiration for her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Oneesama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Oneesama">Oneesama</a> Zakuro (including a love confession that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">could go either way</a>), but also seems interested in boys, most notably when Ichigo asks the Mews what they find attractive to and Minto thinks of a male dancer. For some reason, the 4Kids dub <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubText">changed this</a>, switching the image of a dancer into a picture of Zakuro, tremendously increasing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">Les Yay</a>. Given that 4Kids obviously isn't all that keen on queer characters in childrens' TV shows, the only sensible reason anyone's been able to come up with to explain this is that they were less willing to have a subtextually bi character than a subtextually gay character.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BokuGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BokuGirl">Boku Girl</a></em>, Mizuki is shown to struggle with his feelings for Yumeko and his growing feelings for Takeru among the things going on with his genderbending problem. Come series' end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">around the same time he chooses to stay as a girl as well as come to terms with his love for Takeru, he realizes that he never truly loved Yumeko, and only merely admired her femininity.</span> Why Mizuki couldn't have just fallen out of love with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yumeko</span> without having to make it so he never loved <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her</span> in the first place is anyone's guess. Loki even enforces it; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when Mizuki is made to permanently be a girl, Loki tells her she can switch at any time if she ends up loving the gender opposite to her body, meaning even if she <em>was</em> bisexual she'd be functionally straight either way.</span>
</li><li> Anna from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WanderingSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WanderingSon">Wandering Son</a></em> loved Nitori when she saw her as a boy and she still loves Nitori even after coming to terms with her being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">transgender</a>. It's all-but stated that Anna is bisexual, though she admits that she doesn't mind being seen as lesbian if she's Nitori's girlfriend.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AdventureTimeMarcelineAndTheScreamQueens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AdventureTimeMarcelineAndTheScreamQueens">Adventure Time: Marceline and the Scream Queens</a></em> it is quite obvious that Marceline and Princess Bubblegum are experiencing sexual tension in their relationship. This is evident in Marceline's clear jealousy of Bubblegum's feelings for fellow bandmate, Guy, and Bubblegum's reaction to Marceline admitting to said jealousy. However, many fans argue that Bubblegum's attraction to Guy means that she could not possibly have an intimate relationship with Marceline. Especially odd considering that Bubblegum and Jake had a short, relatively pleasant relationship in the show.
</li><li> John Constantine of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer">Hellblazer</a></em>. In issue 51 he mentions that he's had a few boyfriends, though it remains lip-service bisexuality until the "Ashes and Dust in the City of Angels" story arc, where he seduces and is shown (in very tasteful silhouettes) having sex with the guy he is conning at the time.
</li><li> Though averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor">X-Factor</a></em>, in which Rictor and Shatterstar (both men) have a relationship even though Rictor was previously interested in a female teammate and Shatterstar is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves">taking a leaf from Captain Jack Harkness</a>, it is played painfully straight by many of the book's readers, who responded with confusion and dismay, not because of the relationship (well, some because of that, but they're not relevant here) but because it was <em>clearly</em> blatant disregard for continuity (in their eyes) to show someone being interested in women in one issue and men in another. It's also played (somewhat) straight in the comic itself: while Shatterstar is happily and enthusiastically bisexual, Rictor is gay, and <em>always has been</em>, deep down.
</li><li> Skirted in the pages of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em>: the time-displaced, younger version of Iceman learns he is gay from his teammate, the young version of Jean Grey. Since his older version has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeard">known to have girlfriends</a> in the past, he questions if he's actually bisexual. Jean acknowledges, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi">they say everybody is</a>," but concludes "I think you're more...full gay." To which Iceman reluctantly responds, "I know." Young Iceman also speculates that his older self may have "put away" his homosexuality since being a mutant was already hard enough.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0izeu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0izeu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0izeu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Later heartwrenchingly confirmed by the older Iceman: "The years go by and it gets easier to put that part of yourself away. And then so much time goes by that...you say to yourself late at night: one day, maybe." Young Jean's reply: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LateComingOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LateComingOut">It's not too late.</a>"</span>

Either you're straight and thus a good guy "consercativ" or you're gay and you're an evil "librul"; bisexuality either doesn't exist or is outright ignored in favor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality">Black-and-White Morality</a>.

Upon noticing Kimber and Stormer's strong bond, her sisters Jerrica and Aja come to the conclusion that Kimber's gay. They even joke that Kimber <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">changes boyfriends every other week</a> is because she's been closeted this entire time.

(This is also a reflection of the characters in the original film never using the word "bisexual"; even the character who tells Bruno about Pablo's claim of having once slept with another man only calls him "open-minded".) Later on, Bruno averts this trope and calls himself bisexual after having had enough time to come to terms with it.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrokebackMountain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrokebackMountain">Brokeback Mountain</a></em> was marketed as a gay love story and continues to be near-exclusively referred to as one, even though Ennis and Jack are both married to women and don't seem to be averse to having sex with their wives.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChasingAmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChasingAmy">Chasing Amy</a></em> deals with this trope in-universe, when the bisexual Alyssa identifies as a lesbian for the first half of the film; it's implied that she considered it easier to deny her attraction to men than to deal with the social stigma against bisexuality. Given her lesbian friends ostracize her after she comes out, it makes sense.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EatingOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EatingOut">Eating Out</a></em>, when Troy claims to be a bisexual, he is met with every character around him shouting, "THERE'S NO SUCH THING!!!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/INowPronounceYouChuckAndLarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/INowPronounceYouChuckAndLarry">I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry</a></em> is about a pair of straight men who enter into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeard">fake gay marriage</a>, and must pretend not to be attracted to women so that they won't be found out. While the movie pays lip-service to bisexuality with Captain Tucker's closing speech, there was no indication that it's possible for a man to be attracted to more than one gender, and Adam's character's affairs with women in the past becomes a major plot point. The entire "conflict" could have been ended if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot">Chuck just said he was bisexual and in an open relationship with Larry.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKidsAreAllRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKidsAreAllRight">The Kids Are All Right</a></em>, which was directed and co-written by a lesbian, Jules has (and quite clearly enjoys) sex with a man, but has crappy sex with her wife. Nevertheless, she continues to call herself gay, not straight or bisexual. Needless to say, this has caused a lot of controversy and is often seen as perpetuating a message along the lines of "lesbians secretly want men". Her wife also thinks it means she's straight.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LegallyBlonde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LegallyBlonde">Legally Blonde</a></em>, when a witness is tricked into revealing that he has a boyfriend, this is considered proof he couldn't have had an affair with a woman; in addition, Elle says "gay men know designers, straight men don't". Apparently there are, you guessed it, no bisexuals. The musical version addresses the issue (at least in part) by having the aforementioned boyfriend testify that the witness in question "never, ever, ever, ever swings the other way." Surprisingly justified in this case; the point of this interrogation wasn't so much to prove that he liked guys as it was to prove that he <em>didn't</em> like women (and thus couldn't have had an affair with the suspect). The witness himself, meanwhile, was trying his hardest to <em>not</em> make it apparent that he's attracted to men, hence why he didn't claim to be bi. The musical adds a scene where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Elle</a> does the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze">"bend and snap"</a> in front of him and he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotDistractedByTheSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotDistractedByTheSexy">completely unaffected</a>, which only cements to her that he's not interested in women.
</li><li> In the film version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/QueenOfTheDamned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/QueenOfTheDamned">Queen of the Damned</a></em>, Lestat's canonical male love interests from the novels are nowhere to be found in the film. Nicki's absence was especially jarring to book fans, considering his crucial importance to Lestat's backstory (in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVampireChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVampireChronicles">The Vampire Lestat</a></em>, it was Nicki's Stradivarius that he played to wake Akasha). One of the novel's female characters (who had no romantic or sexual interest in Lestat) was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToLoveInterest">Promoted to Love Interest</a> in the film to compensate for the removal of the other male characters.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyfall">Skyfall</a></em>, James Bond makes a (possibly joking/bluffing) comment to a villain, who is threatening him with rape, about having slept with a man before. This led to talk about whether James Bond—who's had, and clearly enjoyed, more sex with women than just about any non-pornographic movie character—was gay. No bisexuals indeed!
</li><li> Clay from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LessThanZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LessThanZero">Less Than Zero</a></em>, who was bi in the book is only seen sleeping with a woman in the movie.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RickiAndTheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RickiAndTheFlash">Ricki and the Flash</a></em> one of Ricki's children comes out as gay. She says she thought he was bisexual and he claims "that was just my cover story in college."
</li><li> An early example is the 1968 crime drama <em>The Detective</em>, where a gay character states that bisexuals are just "homosexuals without conviction." Of course, the character in question's a murderer and the movie's attitude towards gays isn't much better.
</li><li> In the dystopian setting of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLobster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLobster">The Lobster</a></em>, adults are forcibly paired up through a dating service. When David tries to sign up as a bisexual, he is informed that the option "no longer exists". After a long pause, he decides to sign up as straight.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveSimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveSimon">Love, Simon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Leah (the main character's best friend) is bisexual in the original book; however, in the film, she's not only presumed straight, but she's in love with him. It's actually justified, as Leah's bisexuality was not known to Simon in the original book- he doesn't find out until the sequel. It's possible (even probable, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatingTheEyeCandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatingTheEyeCandy">given her reaction to Abby's Wonder Woman costume</a>) that she is still bisexual and just hasn't come out, the same as her literary counterpart.
</li><li> Less justifiable is the exclusion of Cal Price's bisexuality. Not only does he tell Simon-and ask him out-in the book, but there is a perfect opportunity for him to mention it in the movie, when Simon asks if he's Blue and he says <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">no, but he's there if Simon needs to talk to someone.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheOppositeOfSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheOppositeOfSex">The Opposite of Sex</a></em> has one character chewing out a gay man for having an affair with a woman. He responds that he's bisexual, and she says "I went to a Bar Mitzvah once. That doesn't make me Jewish!" - and said character ends the movie in a relationship with another man.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrJekyllAndMsHyde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrJekyllAndMsHyde">Dr. Jekyll &amp; Ms. Hyde</a></em>: Yves, who's gay, is completely confused when he's attracted to Helen Hyde (and they have sex). At the end when she turns back into Richard, he's relieved, because it means he isn't turning into a heterosexual. The idea he might be just <em>bisexual</em> apparently never occurs to him.

Tree assumes he must be gay, not even considering that he might be bisexual, and the movie never calls her on this assumption. She seems to be right though judging by his reaction when Tree talks with him about it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlueIsTheWarmestColor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlueIsTheWarmestColor">Blue Is the Warmest Color</a></em>: There's criticism of the movie being painted as a "lesbian love story" when Adèle is shown to be capable of having romantic tension and intimate encounters with men. The fact that the film doesn't choose to explore Adèle's possible bisexuality doesn't help.

It's debated throughout the film by Peter and his buddies whether or not Kate is a lesbian even though she genuinely returns his crush (and nobody considers the possibility she could be bi). At the end of the film, Kate kisses her girlfriend Joyce in front of everyone at the winning game and Peter looks on disappointed. Then it turns out she's not a lesbian, she's a bisexual and kisses Peter on the lips too, surprising him and his buddies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BelowHerMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BelowHerMouth">Below Her Mouth</a></em>: After he finds her with Dallas, Rile thinks Jasmine is a lesbian. She logically points out they have been together for years, though her sexuality is left ambiguous, and possible bisexuality isn't discussed.

Ironically, the film was criticized for <em>downplaying</em> Freddie's bisexuality. Apparently, having him outright say "I think I'm bisexual" and depicting him having both a long-term girlfriend and several relationships (sexual and romantic) with men <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">was just too vague</a>.
</li><li> Zigzagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PlanB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PlanB">Plan B</a></em>. Bruno hears that Pablo, who's currently dating his ex-girlfriend, slept with a guy in the past but Pablo admits later on that he lied about having been with a guy to appear more modern-minded. However, he also admits immediately afterwards that he did find the idea of sleeping with another man to be appealing and by the end of the film, while the word "bisexual" is never used to describe him or Bruno (apart from one deleted scene), it's made clear beyond a shadow of doubt that they've fallen in love with each other and that their mutual attraction is every bit as real as their previous relationships with women.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LostAndDelirious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LostAndDelirious">Lost and Delirious</a></em>: Hard to tell. It is never explicitly stated whether or not Tori enjoys her relationship with Jake, rather than simply trying to pretend she's straight.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pariah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pariah">Pariah</a></em>: Bina appears to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LipstickLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LipstickLesbian">Lipstick Lesbian</a>, but insists she's not "<em>gay</em> gay" and sees her encounter with Alike as harmless indulgence. This might mean she's bisexual, but the idea isn't expressed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheObjectOfMyAffection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheObjectOfMyAffection">The Object of My Affection</a></em>: George admits to having sex with his girlfriend at the high school prom, is somewhat turned on by Nina (while in bed with her), and almost has sex with her. Somehow the possibility of George being at least <em>somewhat</em> into women is never discussed. Nor the word "bisexual" ever mentioned.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoomInRome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoomInRome">Room in Rome</a></em>: Natasha refers to Alba and then herself "becoming a lesbian" at various points. The possibility of either being bisexual isn't brought up, despite having relationships with men (though in Alba's case that turns out to be false, and she later calls herself a "lesbian from birth").
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sappho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sappho">Sappho</a></em>: Sappho describes herself as a lesbian upon realizing her attraction toward Helene, though she's also very clearly attracted to men. Here it's pretty justified as the term "bisexual" didn't even exist when the film is set (well, in reference to sexuality anyway), and "lesbian" gets used to simply mean any woman into other women.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EasyA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EasyA">Easy A</a></em>: Brandon, who is known to be gay, is suddenly assumed to be straight after sleeping with a girl. Averted with Olive's mother, who recounts her wild past, which included sleeping with both boys and girls. Though she'd gotten happily married to Olive's dad, there's no indication that it was "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperimentedInCollege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperimentedInCollege">just a phase</a>".
</li><li> In the teen comedy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StatusUpdate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StatusUpdate">Status Update</a></em> Brian is jealous of Kyle at the start of the film, telling him to back off of "his girl".

</li></ul></li><li> In the 2002 sex comedy <em>Buying The Cow</em>, womanizer Mike gets drunk one night and awakens the following morning believing he had slept with a man and makes many hilarious attempts to come out of the closet. Even though he isn't actually gay. After shouting that he is a "blazing homosexual" at his friend's wedding, he's later caught making out with a stripper named Amy inside a limo. His friends chide him for this, reminding him that he said he is gay. Mike cluelessly replies "Yeah, and your point is?". Nobody In-Universe considers the possibility that Mike could be bisexual.

With regards to his sexuality, he starts off bisexual, but decides that he must choose to be either gay or straight, justifying the decision using nearly every stereotype about bisexuality there is.
<div class="indent">"I didn't want to be bisexual. I was too old to experiment like a teenager; I wanted certainty, I wanted solid foundations. I wanted to be monogamous, and even if monogamy was rarely an effortless state for anyone, that was no reason to lumber myself with unnecessary obstacles."

On Barrayar, that's a taboo (just like gayness). Lady Vorkosigan, being from a planet where the only rules about sex are "it has to be consensual" and "having kids requires governmental approval", absently responds, "Was bisexual. Now monogamous," and has to see the other's reaction to realize this was an attempt to blow up the marriage. In a later book, Lady Vorkosigan explains that her husband is bisexual, leaning toward soldiers; her own military background lets him have his cake and eat it too. (Brings more meaning to all the times he calls her "my Captain.")
</li><li> There are several main characters in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VillageTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VillageTales">Village Tales</a></em> series who are bisexual. <em>This</em> trope appears only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> when Edmond, early on (he is swiftly educated out of his view), who is himself gay and in a lasting relationship with the pansexual Teddy, dismisses one of his friends' assertion of bisexuality as mere pretense: "HP. The never-never. 'Bi now, gay later'  really, there's no such thing [as bisexuality]." It doesn't go over well, and he apologizes and reforms his views.

Heather talks with Coach Andrews to figure out if he really had an affair with the murdered Lindsay Combs, only for Andrews to then make it clear that he wants to date her homosexual boss. The text calls Andrews gay, without bringing up the possibility of him being bisexual — until the next chapter, where the term is used to talk about how he never came across as homosexual or bisexual. Andrews is homosexual. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And never had an affair with Lindsay.</span>

There is no evidence that they were ever attracted to men before, or were at all attracted to women afterward.

The closest is a discussion of the "lesbian spectrum," where Amanda claims that all women fall on a spectrum of 0 to 100% gay, referring to herself (a lesbian) as 80% attracted to women and 20% attracted to men, and when Edie claims that she's "50/50," Amanda wants to "raise that number." So technically they're both bisexual, though neither identifies as such.

Will gets a scene in which he says that his romantic attraction to her (and his having tried having sex with women a few times before, because he does find them very aesthetically attractive) is not invalidated by the fact that his dick unfortunately won't react to her touch like he wants it to.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note200uh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note200uh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note200uh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which would actually make him homosexual and bi-romantic, but... eh... baby steps.

Sara went on to join the League of Assassins, she became the lover of Nyssa, daughter of Ras Al' Ghul. When Sara returned to Star (then Starling) City, she and Oliver became physical for a time before breaking up for good. On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow">Legends of Tomorrow</a></em>, except for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> moment with Captain Cold, she's only been with women.

</li><li> An episode from the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrothersAndSisters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrothersAndSisters">Brothers &amp; Sisters</a></em> invoked this trope when Kevin was trying to figure out if a guy he was interested in, Chad, was gay or straight. When one of his siblings suggested that the guy might be bi, his answer was that no one is really bi, and that everyone has to "make a choice" eventually. A few episodes later, after they had been seeing each other for a while, Kevin decided that he was mistaken and that Chad was living proof that someone could really be bisexual.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first few seasons, Willow is portrayed as straight: she had a crush on Xander since childhood, a teeny-tiny one on Giles relegated to background hints, and had a serious relationship with Oz. However, once Tara enters the pictures, she's just "gay now". The idea that she might be attracted to <em>both</em> men and women is never brought up, which is especially jarring considering the episode where she realizes her feelings for Tara makes it abundantly clear that she has lingering feelings for Oz at the same time.
<ul><li> It could be a network or producer thing. When she starts dating Tara in Season 4, she still has feelings for Oz as stated, and later makes remarks about thinking Giles is sexy when she sees him playing guitar. In Season 5, she makes a comment about Dracula being sexy that makes Tara uncomfortable. Later she has a major argument with her about how Tara probably thinks she's going to go back to guys. The implication, however, is that Tara might be worried that Willow is just treating the relationship as a college-experimental lark, and is insecure about Willow's devotion to the relationship regardless of whom she finds attractive. Come Season 6, however, after the show moved to UPN and Marti Noxon took over producing the show, Willow became All Gay, All the Time. This was especially aggravated in the Season 7 episode "Him", where several of the female characters are magically charmed into falling in love with a high school boy, Anya says that Willow <em>can't</em> love him because she's gay now and he has a penis, and Willow decides the only way to make the relationship work is to magically remove the penis and turn him into a girl.
</li></ul></li><li> Likewise when vampire!Willow shows up again in "Doppelgangland", Willow refers to her as "kind of gay" after she attempts to seduce her. This is ignoring that vampire!Willow was clearly in a relationship with vampire!Xander in "The Wish" - but of course Willow didn't know this.
</li><li> After Buffy and Satsu hook up in the season 8 comics, several good reasons are given why they can't stay together, but apparently the main reason is that the former is "not a dyke". But could she be bi? The possibility isn't so much as alluded to. Later, we get Kennedy saying "You're not the only fool to ever wrinkle the sheets with a straight girl", which is arguably fair, but the possibility that she's bisexual still isn't mentioned. Her straightness is treated as just obvious. Even Xander gets in on it: when Buffy admits her attraction to him, he says that he is on the list as a potential romantic interest "right after gay. I rate almost as good as trying to change your sexual orientation. You went <em>through gay</em> to me."
</li><li> For most of his appearances, Andrew is portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">Ambiguously Gay</a> and his obliviousness about it is often played for laughs. He is implied to have a crush on Warren, shares a bed with Jonathan, fantasizes about actors Scott Bakula, Patrick Swayze and Viggo Mortensen, and sings along to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga">Lady Gaga</a>'s <em>Born This Way</em>. On the other hand, he gets upset when Warren refuses to make him a robot copy of Christina Ricci, says Scully from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> "wants [him] so bad", and lectures both Spike and Angel about dating and women before leaving with two attractive women (which Joss Whedon later stated was intended to be a mixed-gender group). However, after kissing a man in season 10 he almost immediately comes out as gay, with various characters commenting on how completely obvious it always was. Bisexuality seems to be a non-existing concept in the Buffyverse.
</li></ul></li><li> Apparently Mary Beth Lacey was married off to avert initial audience reactions that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CagneyAndLacey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CagneyAndLacey">Cagney &amp; Lacey</a></em> were a "couple of dykes".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em>, more than once. In "Kill the Messenger" a male suspect is revealed to have been having sex with a man at one point, and this is treated as unassailable proof that he could not have had sex with a woman.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers">Cheers</a></em>, one of Rebecca's ex-boyfriends comes to the bar, and she's thinking of taking him back. When, with Rebecca absent, an off-hand mention of an ex-boyfriend of his own makes Sam realize that winning him back is impossible (which, of course, it turns out to be), and starting off a plot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut">wondering whether to tell her</a>. Note that he doesn't say he's gay until near the end of the episode (when Rebecca's trying to seduce him). It should also be noted that said ex-boyfriend admits that Rebecca was the only woman he ever found attractive and it was a "confusing" time in his life.
</li><li> Subverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase">Cold Case</a></em> episode "Triple Threat". Chelsea comments that the murder victim, Elena, was a dating a man in high school, and she later saw him in a gay bar. She seems to think that he's gay, but if Elena found out, he would be willing to kill her to keep it hidden. When the detectives question him he openly states that he's bisexual. The detectives take him seriously, and he's quickly (and accurately) dismissed as a suspect.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral">Comedy Central</a> roast of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner">William Shatner</a>, where the other comedians repeatedly and pointedly refer to Andy Dick as "gay", while the camera cuts to him getting steadily more indignant in the background.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JohnConstantine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JohnConstantine">John Constantine</a> is at least nominally bisexual in the source comics. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Constantine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Constantine">Constantine</a></em> gave no indication of the source bisexuality, with executive producer Daniel Cerone suggesting that the series might deal with Constantine's bisexuality in season 20 of the series. Executive producer David S. Goyer, when asked if Constantine would be bisexual, laughed and wondered why he was always asked that question about his series. Goyer was the creator of <em>Da Vinci's Demons</em>, which also straightwashed its protagonist. Averted when John Constantine was moved to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow">Legends of Tomorrow</a></em>, where his bisexuality isnt hidden.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ControlZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ControlZ">Control Z</a></em>: Lots of people call Gerry gay once it's revealed he's viewed gay porn, despite him otherwise being aggressively heterosexual and having a girlfriend. The idea he might be bisexual isn't raised. However, from what Gerry later says of himself (that he likes girls, but men having sex also interests him) it seems likely he's bisexual.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet">Coronation Street</a></em>:
<ul><li> Todd realised he was gay after being in a loving and committed relationship with Sarah for nearly three years. Even after coming out he admitted he still loved Sarah and enjoyed being in a relationship with her but he never entertains the possibility he has an attraction to multiple genders (he previously also dated Candice) and he's only had relationships with men since.
</li><li> Occurs again with Marcus and Maria's relationship. Marcus identifies as a gay man who fell in love with a woman. Maria insists that he calls himself straight. Maybe bisexual is the word they are both looking for?
</li><li> The trope was finally averted when Amber suddenly made a pass at Sophie, after having an attraction to men for years. She was referred to by the media as 'bisexual'.
</li></ul></li><li> Thankfully, this is completely and utterly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted">averted</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CrazyExGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CrazyExGirlfriend">Crazy Ex-Girlfriend</a></em>, where Darryl, Rebecca's boss, becomes attracted to a guy (White Josh) and temporarily panics (Darryl has an ex-wife and daughter). After an enlightening yoga session however (where he looks at both male and female butts), he realizes that he is a "both-sexual." Then, because <em>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend</em> is a musical, he sings a song called <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7844P77Is">"Getting Bi"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which actually addresses bisexual erasure.

Due to the fact that his friends dislike Abigail, he tries not to like her either, but fails. He's not talking himself into liking her, he really does. Then he gets a crush on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his roommate Christian</span>, which causes him to question his sexuality. Then he gets a boyfriend, then kisses Abigail again, then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">dies</span>. And nowhere is the word "bi" so much as mentioned.
</li><li> Leonardo da Vinci is generally believed to have been, if not flat-out gay, at least bisexual. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DaVincisDemons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DaVincisDemons">Da Vinci's Demons</a></em> portrays him as aggressively heterosexual. His one (off-screen) dalliance with a man is dismissed as "experimentation" and in contrast with his explicit sexual acts with many women, his one kiss with another man is a chaste kiss good-bye.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DearWhitePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DearWhitePeople">Dear White People</a></em>: Neika Hobbs is in a long-term relationship with a woman. She's always called a lesbian, though she also has an affair with Troy. The closest anyone gets to acknowledging that she's actually bisexual is Troy saying that she isn't a lesbian with him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Degrassi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Degrassi">Degrassi</a></em> almost escaped this, but then fell right back into it once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette">The Lad-ette</a> Lesbian Alex was written off the show. When they started the plot, Paige's feelings for Alex had her confused, eventually coming to terms with not having labels attached. Having Paige openly date guys and Alex at the same time. Alex also said she was bi at the start of the arc, then revealed herself to be a lesbian by the middle of it. Paige stuck with bisexual up until Alex left the show, then it was a 'phase' and Alex was '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItsYouItsOkay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItsYouItsOkay">the only girl for her</a>.' And while <em>Degrassi</em> usually has at least one gay or lesbian character (plus satellite romantic interest cast), the line is clearly defined each time.
<ul><li> Another instance is that of Imogen. Imogen started out as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkingIsLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkingIsLove">stalker</a> of Eli, though later developed a crush on him - which bloomed into a romance. After they broke up, Imogen began a relationship with Fiona, which continued until the latter graduated at the end of season 12. Imogen also kissed Adam, and had another relationship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName">Jack</a> (who is a girl). Imogen never uses the term "bisexual" to describe herself, but rather states that she "likes people".
</li><li> Initially played straight with Miles, then gradually subverted. In season 13, he had relationships with both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Zoe</a> and Maya, and had a reputation of being a player at his former school. However, at the end of that season, Miles began a relationship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">Tristan</a>, which caused a great deal of confusion, given the fact that he only had previous relationships with girls. After Miles broke up with Tristan, he had a fling with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBitch">Esme</a>, though he still had feelings for Tristan. Eventually, he got back together with Tristan, though he didn't classify himself as bisexual. His bisexuality actually becomes a plot point in season 16 of the show, where he gains a writing scholarship on the basis of being LGBT; at the end of the episode, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">he</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">finally</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">identified as bisexual</a>.

This would mean she was most likely bisexual than anything, but everyone, including her, describes her as a lesbian, with the token gay couple flat out stating she can't have gay feelings for a woman because she is straight and there "isn't an on off switch". At no point is bisexuality ever considered, even as a concept.
</li><li> Bree's son Andrew, who had been openly gay for many years, returned to Bree's house having gotten engaged to a young woman. Bree is flabbergasted and quickly suspects (correctly) he is marrying the woman for her money. Again at no point is the idea that Andrew might be bi even raised as a possibility—Andrew himself even tries to insist being gay was a phase. Which is strange, because he alludes at being bisexual right after coming out ("I love vanilla ice cream, but once in a while I will be in mood for chocolate"). Everyone, including himself, continues using the term gay for the next few seasons, though.

She also mentions she's had sex with men in the past, but her preference is for women. Andrea later claims not to find men desirable at all or have sex with them.

Admittedly, another attempt to prove they were gay was "owning a bread machine", so it may just be down to the characters being dumb. Ironically, Drew himself could be seen, among other things, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim">having sex dreams about George Clooney</a>.

Depending on what season and how it was written, Steven (who openly admitted he was gay in the show's first season) may or may not have had some genuine attraction to Claudia and Sammy Jo. Not that it ever lasted. By the reunion mini-series he had settled down permanently with Bart Fallmont, a love interest from a previous season. Never was the word "bisexual" ever brought up.
</li><li> Kerry Weaver on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER">ER</a></em>. This was briefly addressed in one episode — Weaver was re-united with her birth mother, but the mother was appalled when she learned of Weaver's sexuality, asking her how she could "choose" to be that way. Weaver said in blunt terms that she was "alone in her soul" before she realized she was gay, despite a couple of obviously passionate relationships she had had with men before that.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em>: In one episode, Frasier briefly considers the idea he might be gay, based solely on the fact that his mannerisms <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampStraight">fit many stereotypes</a>. Martin, reasonably, objects that he would know by now. The fact he never thought he <em>might</em> be bi, despite only having been in relationships with or attracted to women before, makes it an example of this trope.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>:
<ul><li> Prior to the start of the series, Ross's wife Carol comes out as a lesbian after seven years of marriage to a man - which is perhaps not in itself unusual, particularly in a less than gay-friendly early '90s context (especially since it's later made clear that her parents are at least vaguely homophobic since they refused to come to her and Susan's wedding). However, it's clear that she and Ross still enjoyed a sexual relationship together for a while after she got involved with Susan - not only does he explicitly bring up on one occasion how they had "some good times before she became a lesbian...and a few afterwards, as well," but a flashback to exactly one year before the pilot episode reveals that their son Ben must have been conceived at least three months after she admitted to seeing Susan. However, bisexuality is never brought up, and everyone accepts that she's exclusively gay.
</li><li> In one episode Joey refers to Ross as a guy who "married a woman who was nearly a lesbian, and then pushed her over the edge." Granted, it's intended as an insult and it's said by Joey, but Carol being bisexual would make a lot more sense.
</li><li> It might be that Carol is portrayed as gay to make her more sympathetic. An openly bisexual woman cheating on her husband, whether with a woman or man, and eventually leaving him for her new lover just wouldn't be as likable (and may have a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a>) as a repressed lesbian who's dealing with her sexual awakening and the breakdown of her marriage in the best way she can.
</li><li> Also, Phoebe is shown to be attracted to women on occasion, and seems to be seriously considering asking out Ross and Monica's ridiculously beautiful cousin Cassie (although it could be argued that this is more a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGirlsWantHer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGirlsWantHer">Even the Girls Want Her</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItsYouItsOkay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItsYouItsOkay">If It's You, It's Okay</a>). She is, however, openly admiring of attractive women on a number of occasions. Despite this, she's only ever shown dating men.
</li><li> When Phoebe's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CitizenshipMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CitizenshipMarriage">Canadian husband</a>, who was considered gay, suddenly divorced her for another woman there was no mention that he could be a bisexual - presumably because a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingStraightStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingStraightStory">Coming Straight Story</a> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">funnier</a>. He also admitted he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperimentedInCollege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperimentedInCollege">had experimented with women while in college</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GimmeGimmeGimme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GimmeGimmeGimme">Gimme, Gimme, Gimme</a></em> has a TV presenter named Vic Cheesecloth, who spends his entire episode acting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Camp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Camp">camp</a> and "flirting" with openly gay Tom, who has come to appear in one of his sofa commercials. When Tom eventually develops feelings for him, he asks him whether he could move in to his mansion, to which Vic roars with laughter and states that his wife would be annoyed, making Tom freak out because they had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsOnlyOneBed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsOnlyOneBed">shared a bed in the hotel</a>. Vic excuses this by saying that he's a "straight man that sleeps with men." Considering the sitcom has mentioned bisexuality before, this trope might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience">being parodied</a>, but there hasn't been an openly bisexual character (unless you count Linda having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment">one night stand with a female taxi driver</a>), so this is debatable.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Girls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Girls">Girls</a></em>, Hannah's ex Elijah Krantz is generally portrayed as "having always been gay" despite his attraction to women in the past. He tries to "prove" he is bisexual, and him not enjoying the sex is seen as objective evidence for him being gay, ignoring what he identifies as.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>:
<ul><li> The show had two female high school students that appeared to be bisexual, cheerleaders <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGirls">Brittany and Santana</a>. Santana was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOutStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOutStory">subsequently revealed</a> to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LipstickLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LipstickLesbian">lesbian</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">ditzy</a> Brittany identified herself as "fluid" and "bi-curious".
</li><li> Blaine, a gay exchange student, becomes confused over his orientation in one episode and is convinced that he is bisexual. His friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">Kurt</a> dismisses this and claims that gay teenagers call themselves that "when they want to hold hands with [the opposite sex] and feel normal for a change", to which Blaine calls that a double-standard. Despite that, Blaine turns out to be "100% gay" at the end of the episode, which slightly backfires on the entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">anvil drop.</a>
<ul><li> One of the three series' creators, Ryan Murphy, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">reported to have apparently stated</a> that the decision to make Blaine gay instead of bisexual was because "the [gay] kids need to know he's one of them." So, bisexual viewers don't need representation too?
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableAlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableAlphaBitch">Quinn</a> gets drunk at a wedding and has drunken sex with Santana in a nearby hotel. The two of them never speak of it again afterwards and it spreads around their circle of friends. Possibly because of Quinn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">appearing less and less in the series</a>, there's not one point whether she questions her sexuality (considering she's dated two boys in her grade, one in the grade below and a 30-something university teacher).
</li><li> While most media tend to refer to people as either "gay" or "straight", depending on who they're involved with (romantically and/or sexually), <em>Glee</em> goes out of its way to avoid using the B word (so much so that there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DrinkingGame/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DrinkingGame/Glee">an entry on the show's drinking game page about it</a>). Whenever the word <em>is</em> used, it's to poke fun at people who think the concept even exists and/or to explicitly state that it isn't. Brittany is the closest there is to a bisexual character on the show (and even then, there's the implication that her sexuality is due to her ditziness , more than anything else).
</li></ul></li><li> The Netflix series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GraceAndFrankie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GraceAndFrankie">Grace and Frankie</a></em> opens with two couples getting together for brunch and a big announcement, only it's not the retirement announcement the wives are expecting, it's the announcement that the two men are gay and want to get married to each other. For the rest of the series, they and everyone else refer to them as gay. Bisexuality is never brought up despite 40 years of marriage and 20 years of adultery in each case, plus multiple children in each marriage (albeit with two adopted). One could argue that they've been gay all along and merely closeted... except one of the major plot points of season 2 is Frankie and Sol <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> have sex again on the day that they move all their stuff out of their old house</span>. The series does, however, go some ways toward showing that love and sexual orientation can be complicated; Sol clearly loved Frankie and still does, and Robert admits to missing the way that being with Grace made him feel - "There was nothing in the world like walking into a room with that woman."
</li><li> The character of Callie Torres on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy">Grey's Anatomy</a></em> broadened her sexual horizons when she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosetKey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosetKey">started a relationship with fellow surgeon Erica Hahn</a>. After a spell of sexual confusion Callie affirmed that she enjoyed sleeping with both her girlfriend and her male friend Mark. She was written as a classic, equal-opportunity bisexual. Subsequently people started to refer to her as exclusively a lesbian, with Erica going so far as to say that "You can't 'kind of' be a lesbian". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">They later acknowledged that she was bisexual</a>, but other characters still have a problem getting it—when threatened by Callie's constant presence in Mark's life, Lexie asked her "How gay are you? On a scale from one to... gay."
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyEndings">Happy Endings</a></em>. It's stated outright that Jane dated girls in college, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperimentedInCollege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperimentedInCollege">but it's portrayed as though she was going through a phase</a>.

When its revealed that Jane was actually in love and in a serious relationship with her, it becomes clear that it was more than a phase and Brad becomes insanely jealous.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hollyoaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hollyoaks">Hollyoaks</a></em>:
<ul><li> While this trope was averted with several characters, most notably Kris, during John-Paul and Craig's romance the idea that Craig—who had been involved with several female characters before, seemed to enjoy said relationships, and wanted to stay with his girlfriend Sarah—might be bisexual was mentioned all of once, several weeks after the storyline ended. All that was said on the matter while it was ongoing was:
<div class="indent"><strong>John Paul:</strong> You have sex with men, in my books that makes you gay.
</div></li><li> Ste had been on the show for a number of years, only expressing an interest in women, when he suddenly began an affair with another man. No attempt was made to suggest he was bisexual - instead, the explanation given was a retcon that he had loved a boy while in young offenders, so had been gay all along. Ste remained identified as gay even after he later fathered a child and began a relationship with the child's mother.
</li><li> Doug only expressed interest in women for a number of years until he suddenly fell in love with Ste. As with Ste, a retcon that he had had a crush on a male friend in childhood was enough to now claim he was gay and had been gay all along.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em>, despite having a bisexual on the character list in the form of Thirteen, invoked this in the episode "The Choice"—the choice for the patient being straight or gay. That there is a third option is brought up in passing a couple times, but not much is made of it; mainly because the character was entirely attracted to men until he decided to get "fixed" at one of those infamous camps, and claims to have become entirely "straight" as a result, although the other characters mostly don't believe him when he says this.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>, Ted states that he hates a man named Gary Blauman because they were in competition for a girl. Later, Barney's gay brother James reveals he also hates Gary because he cheated on his husband with him and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">blames him for his divorce</a>. Ted immediately (and correctly) deduces that Gary is gay and that the latter was actually fighting with the girl for him. Nobody suggests that having an affair with a man and flirting with a girl are not incompatible.

Bisexuality is not considered an option by either party. Oliver later raises the idea of Aiden being bisexual, but Michaela quickly shoots this down and Aiden is basically never mentioned again.
</li><li> Zigzagged with Annalise, who was dating and sleeping with Eve before leaving her for Sam; she reconnects with Eve as well in Season 2. In the past, she was not as comfortable with her sexuality as she seems to be in the present. Annalise and Eve's previous relationship was derailed when Annalise became concerned with the idea that she was a lesbian; she went to Sam shortly afterward, implying that it had something to do with this concern. Further, Eve seems convinced (at least in the flashbacks to ten years in the past) that Annalise is actually a lesbian in denial. In Season 3, two men hit on Eve and Annalise at a bar; Eve says that she's a lesbian, whereas Annalise says "It's complicated."

She indicates this is an exception, but they don't appear to realize that bisexuality's even a possibility.
</li><li> The recurring joke that Maya's gay also don't make much sense unless you assume she's <em>really</em> closeted, given all her relationships have been men. She's straight, but they don't ever joke that she might be bi and also into women.

Though ultimately subverted in that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he wasn't bisexual, he was actually straight and being paid to do gay porn in order to pay for his daughter's medical treatment.</span>
</li><li> The episode "Lowdown", where "down-low" (ebonic slang for "man on the side") is described by Tutuola as "closeted black men who have sex 'on the down-low' then go back and pretend to be attracted to their wives." In the entire episode, no variant of the word "bisexual" is used <em>once</em>. Three egregious lines:
<div class="indent"><strong>Dr. Huang</strong>: You're not the first woman who's slept with a closeted man. Sexuality is very complicated. Just because he was gay didn't mean he wasn't attracted to you. <br/><strong>Tutuola</strong>: Guess what? That [sex with men] MEANS YOU'RE GAY! <br/><strong>Andy</strong>: I love you. That's why I couldn't admit who I was... couldn't leave my family... couldn't admit I was gay.

And not as in, "Oh, he has a boyfriend, never mind," but the SVU detectives <em>repeatedly saying</em>, "How can he be the prime suspect? He's <em>gay</em>!"

Both of them are aware of the other and it seems to be shaping up into an interesting poly relationship. However the writers seem to have decided not to pursue the the possibilities of this storyline and Season 2 begins with the guy breaking up with her because she's clearly more interested in women (later on, Jenny's sexuality gets complex again when she is dating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">transgender</a> man in the process of transitioning).

</li><li> When Abby becomes attracted to (and then has sex with) a woman, she (and everyone else) assumes this means she's a lesbian, even though previously she only had sex with men (due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">Laser-Guided Amnesia</a> making her forget everything prior to the storm). No one appears to think that she could just be a bisexual, or is even aware of the idea. This could be explained though, in that Abby had been searching for a connection in all of her sexual encounters and had found zero sense of fulfillment by being with any of these men.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NipTuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NipTuck">Nip/Tuck</a></em> seems rather biased against bisexuals at times. Lesbian characters demand for bi-curious women to "pick a side", seeming to think that you can only be one or the other. Many of the people who do show sexual attraction to multiple genders seem to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual">psychotic and slightly dangerous</a>.

<ul><li> A big scandal involves Angela marrying a state senator who Oscar thinks is actually gay, based on looks he gives other men. The possibility that the senator is actually bisexual never comes up, despite him being introduced in the series as having been married to a woman already and having a son (who is promptly forgotten in later episodes). The bisexuality issue aside, the writers of <em>The Office</em> also seemed to think that being gay meant a man couldn't possibly have sex with a woman - when Angela becomes pregnant, one of Oscar's reasons to suspect she actually had an affair is that her husband is gay.
</li><li> In another episode, Andy starts to question his sexuality after Michael starts a (deliberately false) rumor that he's gay. Despite Andy's clearly-depicted interest in women throughout the previous seasons (and the fact that the only "evidence" he provides for his possible homosexuality is a pretty mild fantasy about kissing Brad Pitt), the possibility that he might be bi rather than gay apparently never occurs to him. At one point he even asks the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinority">Token Gay</a> Oscar for advice, only for Oscar to dismiss the matter with a remark about "insecure straight guys."

Piper clearly <em>is</em> bisexual, having an ongoing interest in both her fiancé Larry and her old flame Alex. But not a single character on the entire show seems to consider <em>describing</em> her as bisexual—not even herself, until Larry asks his father if she's technically bi. Perhaps tellingly, most of the characters who call her "straight" are gay, while most of the characters who call her "gay" or "lesbian" are straight. The few people who consider the possibility seem to prefer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotUsingTheZWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotUsingTheZWord">avoiding labels entirely</a>, except again, Larry who uses the word once. This falls into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, unfortunately—bisexuals are often seen as an outsider by both gay and straight folks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OrphanBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OrphanBlack">Orphan Black</a></em> is an odd example: neither Cosima nor Delphine have ever expressed any interest in men, so it would have been perfectly easy to portray them both as lesbians when they became a couple. However, when Delphine first kissed Cosima she said that she had 'never considered bisexuality', and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> stated that Cosima just happened to be bi, making it a cool, rare example of a relationship between two bisexuals. But then in season three, Cosima referred to herself as a lesbian, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> stated that Delphine actually wasn't bi as they had implied but straight with a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItsYouItsOkay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItsYouItsOkay">If It's You, It's Okay</a>.

Despite dating and making out with other men, he still feels an attraction to women. This is hard for his housemates to understand (they think he's gay, but denying it) and even the guy he dates think he's in denial about being gay. MTV themselves invoked this as well, by editing the episodes to almost exclusively include his interactions with men. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.afterelton.com/people/2010/02/mikemanning?page=0%2C0">In this article with After Elton<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, he comes out as fully bisexual and says he prefers men.

The conversation eventually steers to her claiming that Lister's friend Todhunter was gay in her dimension. Lister is incredulous, since Todhunter in his dimension was a married man with kids and mistresses. Kochansky says that didn't matter. The fact that Todhunter could have been bisexual wasn't brought up, though the whole thing was almost certainly a fabrication to distract Lister.

All arrows point to her being bisexual, but when she came to Roseanne's house with a male date after coming out, Roseanne and her other friends were confused, asking things such as "Well, won't they kick you out of the club for that?" apparently thinking if she'd dated women she's lesbian.

Although, a least partially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> by the fact that mobsters wouldn't have the most nuanced view of sexuality, and anything less that 100% stereotypical macho heteronormativity would be viewed as "gay" by them, in an earlier episode it's revealed that even performing oral sex on a woman is considered potential evidence of homosexuality.

A man accused of orally sodomizing his four-year-old niece supposedly admitted to a lie-detector test administrator that he'd had sexual relationships with men in the past, and that he preferred men to women. Despite being in a long-term sexual relationship with a woman at the time, <em>everyone</em> on the show condemned it as being a further element of his monstrosity. Even Steve chewed him out for not just admitting that he was gay and living an ordinary gay life, because "if you have sex with men, you're gay".

</li><li> One of the two jokes used on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThreesCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThreesCompany">Three's Company</a></em> was Jack posing as a gay man so the conservative Mr. Roper (and, later, the moronic Mr. Furley) would allow him to share an apartment with two unmarried women. The possibility of him being bisexual was brought up <em>once</em>... with Jack taking the entire episode to figure out that that would get him kicked out just as quickly as being straight.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TigerKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TigerKing">Tiger King</a></em>, much is made of the fact that Joe Exotic's husbands also had relationships with women. Strangely, though, the documentary seems to try to draw the conclusion that they were straight guys who only went along with a gay relationship for the benefits Joe could provide, rather than considering what should be the more obvious possibility that they might be bisexual.

She tells Jason about it who instantly assumes he's gay, even though James was clearly in love with Jess and enjoyed having sex with her. She thinks he's "confused" even though he's at least 70 years old (having been turned into a vampire as a young man in the 1960's) and would most likely have a grip on his sexuality by now. She was conveniently blind to the fact that she was a shitty girlfriend, and <em>that</em> is why he cheated on her; his bisexuality simply made Lafayette a viable option.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace">Will &amp; Grace</a></em>: Though there are a number of bisexual characters that make appearances throughout the show, this trope is brought in dialogue a few times. Will at one point says "Pansexual? Isn't that just a rest stop on the highway to homo?". In the first season, Will and Grace are both attracted to a new tenant in their apartment building, who seems to be potentially interested in them both. They argue over whether he's straight or gay; the possibility of his being bi is never raised. In the second season, the produce guy gives Grace his number, and everyone assumes that this means he never sleeps with guys.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revival">Revival</a> is a bit better about this, in an episode featuring Grace's niece and her bisexual boyfriend both Will and Grace are convinced that he is a gay guy who is just lying to himself, and take it upon themselves to break the couple up for their own good, since they assume the guy will either be miserable pretending to be straight or will inevitably leave her for a man and break her heart, just like what happened with the two of them. Will and Grace are both depicted as out of touch for their view of sexuality as: gay, straight, nothing in between, with Grace's niece explicitly calling Will out for bisexual erasure and her boyfriend stating that he doesn't see staying with her as giving up on sex with men but just being in a monogamous relationship. Will's still obviously very sceptical at the idea of bisexuality, but he acknowledges that by telling the young man that he's just "confused", he sounds like the homophobes who told him that he wasn't really gay when he was young and they both give the couple their blessing.

It's treated as incredibly awkward, with the characters making the immediate assumption that (1) the wife must be unaware that her husband has dated men in the past, and (2) that the husband must be using the marriage as a cover for his repressed sexuality. Unlike most episodes - which show Damien in particular getting into increasingly cringe-inducing situations, often due to his tendency to make snap judgments - it's played entirely straight: the episode ends with the wife discovering her husband's sexual history and <em>immediately</em> breaking down in tears because "she knew he never really loved her".

</li><li> The moment <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Joey Claire</a> expressed an interest in both her own gender and a male character, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HiveSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HiveSwap">Hive Swap</a></em> fandom plunged into heated debate over whether she was really bisexual or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">a lesbian trying to convince herself that she was straight.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em> has the mildly (for a video game) controversial and definitely infamous matter of Kanji's sexuality, which was intentionally left ambiguous by the writers to allow the player to interpret the character as they like. Opinions on this range from "He's gay and insecure about his sexuality" to "He's straight and afraid of being rejected for his domestic hobbies" to "He's a teenager and still discovering himself", due to various lines of dialogue and events, but few, if any, of Kanji's scenes ever present the idea that he may just be bi; the fandom generally treats "He's bisexual" as a compromise to end arguments over the matter, rather than as a legitimate sexual orientation. This is muddled further by the fact that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetOnPollyOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetOnPollyOliver">has a crush</a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen">Naoto</a>, both before and after the revelation of her gender.

Ellen is bisexual, and Grace is effectively so. Some people feel, however, with Ellen choosing to sidestep her attraction to men and Grace's affection generally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleTargetSexuality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleTargetSexuality">being limited solely to Tedd</a>, the two characters are bisexual only in the most literal sense. Others, though, feel that the comic is not an example due to the TF Gun inducing bisexuality in most of its victims, as well as the fact that Ellen and Grace <em>have</em> been known to express their attraction to men and women respectively, just not often. Ellen <a class="urllink" href="http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=2045">currently identifies<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> as a bisexual homoromantic, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRant">The Rant</a> under that strip talks a bit about the situation, with the point that different people have different ideas of what bisexual actually means.

It's a bit of a plot point when Collin, after dating Fox for years, realizes he is, in fact, gay.

However, after a failed attempt at sex with similarly curious Sandra, Sandra declares herself and DiDi "two naked straight girls with poor boundary issues". Later on, DiDi simply becomes desperate for an orgasm and isn't really particular about who gets her there.
</li><li> Appears in-universe, when Dillon is surprised to learn that his then-boyfriend Matt is bi, not gay. The comic also includes Gary, a nominally-straight man who is implied to have bisexual tendencies, and Yuki, a nominal lesbian who <em>may</em> have bisexual tendencies which she represses as a result of, um, "tentacle-related childhood trauma". The comic does a fairly decent job of acknowledging the fluidity of human sexuality without resorting to a polarized form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi">Everyone Is Bi</a>.

It wasn't until after starting her long-term relationship with Lisa that she admitted to being bisexual. It's mentioned that many of Lisa's lesbian friends don't really believe in bisexuality, and the bisexual Vanessa once told Peejee about a female ex she'd dumped for saying she'd "get over it".
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Niels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Niels">Niels</a></em>, in which numerous characters are bisexual. In-universe, however, Duncan believed this as a youth, assumed that his attraction to men meant that he was gay and that his attraction to women was invalid.
</li><li> Parodied in the webcomic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Loserz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Loserz">Loserz</a></em>, with the openly bisexual Jodie. One strip showed her switching between men and women depending on which gender she was mad at at the moment, meaning she was either straight or gay depending on her mood.

You never were! You can't wake up one morning and find you have turned gay!" The possibility that Heather may be a bisexual never occurs to them.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder14');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder14" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Sex advice columnist Dan Savage spent a number of years loudly and publicly convinced that bisexual people did not exist (namely that anyone who claimed to be one was either a straight person looking for attention or a closeted gay person). Eventually, he shifted to the idea that bisexual women are real but bisexual men aren't, before finally accepting that anyone of any gender can be bi. This view of his seems to have come from the fact that, like many other gay or lesbian people, he himself came out as bisexual as a "stepping stone" to his later coming out as being gay. While this is true for some people, in reality it doesn't apply to every single person who uses the bisexual label, and the inverse (people coming out as gay first before later coming out as bisexual) is also true for some.
