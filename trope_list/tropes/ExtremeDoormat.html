A doormat, for those who do not know the slang expression, is someone who lets other people walk all over them. They lack drive, ambition, and even <em>opinions</em>. Something about them just drives them to make <em>everyone</em> happy even at the expense of their own happiness and kowtow to every order and insult they're given, no matter how ridiculous or unfair it may be to them.

</li><li> Bertolt Hoover, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>. He seems to be exceptionally aware of his own failings, and resigned to it even with his exceptional talents as a soldier.

However, she does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrewASpine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrewASpine">Grew a Spine</a> afterwards.
</li><li> Lithuania in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em> seems to border on this- he's sweet, humble, obedient, and pretty happy considering how much he gets bossed about, especially by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">Bad Boss</a> Russia and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">best friend</a> Poland.

</li><li> Train from the anime version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat">Black Cat</a></em> was this for quite a few episodes during his time in Chronos.

</li><li> Nemu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> is a somewhat Rei-like example of the trope. In her case, she was actually created by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> Mayuri to serve as his obedient assistant. He has no compunction about injuring or even potentially kill her, as he can simply rebuild her. And yet she still cares for him on some level.

</li></ul></li><li> Haji from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodPlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodPlus">Blood+</a></em> is characterized entirely by his complete devotion to Saya and his obedience to her wishes, even when she makes him promise to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kill her.

</li><li> Dolls in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack">Darker Than Black</a></em> are incredibly submissive. People tend to think they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell">outright have no will of their own</a>, although some develop the ability to think for themselves to an extent.
</li><li> Gohan from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> was one for most of the series: a total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommasBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommasBoy">Momma's Boy</a> who worked diligently at his studies, whenever Goku wasn't stealing him for more training to save the world. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">Characterization Marches On</a>, however, and we see him gradually learning to stand up for himself and the people he cares about in the Namek saga, though Vegeta's criticism still got him to clam up. Even when he was a teenager, Videl managed to blackmail him into submission.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em>:
<ul><li> Anri Sonohara. She eventually starts to develop a spine.
</li><li> Also, Saki Mikajima. She'll listen to whatever Izaya tells her to do, even if it means endangering her life. Even after she betrays him, she continues loyally obeying him afterward, too.

It was only after Monta defeated him in a catching battle that Tetsuma began to develop his own ambitions and more emotions.
</li><li> Shirou Emiya, main character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em>. Inspired by the man who saved his life, he dreams of being a superhero who can create a world where nobody ever has to suffer. ...But before the plot kicks in, he's basically just a high schooler whose war on suffering takes the form of doing various chores and repairs for his classmates, all of whom routinely dump work on him. Some of them are polite and grateful about it... and some of them, such as Shinji Matou, don't even bother to pretend that they're not taking advantage of him. That said, if you actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">hurt anyone in front of him</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">his more heroic side will emerge</a>.
</li><li> Tohru Honda from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em> starts out like this. She constantly apologizes for the smallest of things, rarely stands up for herself, often chooses to belittle or instantly forgive very serious wrongs done to her, and is very much a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna">Pollyanna</a>. Much of the series centers around Tohru steadily gaining the courage to face herself and her problems and to defend what she loves.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyBum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyBum">Sloth</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> is <em>so</em> lazy, he lacks the basic will to say no to what Father and the other Homunculi tell him to do.
</li><li> Yukiteru Amano of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary">Future Diary</a></em> starts out as an Extreme Doormat, and becomes less of one as the series goes on.
</li><li> Yugi Moto of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> starts out as one, particularly in the early episodic period. He frequently does as bullies tell him to instead of getting help, even when the situation escalates to the point when he could get hurt. One chapter has him forced to sell tickets for a bully classmate's concert. The bully classmate is a terrible singer, so Yugi can't sell a single ticket. Yugi then volunteers to take tickets from another classmate, so he has even more he can't sell. He does all this knowing not selling a ticket will earn him a beating, but promises to watch the classmate's concert himself to make up for it. Yugi growing to stand up for himself is the major arc of his character development.
</li><li> Sanada Yukimura from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gate7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gate7">Gate 7</a></em> is so much of a doormat that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigShutUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigShutUp">called to shut up</a> by his students...<em>kindergarten students</em>.
</li><li> Yukinari Sasaki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlsBravo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlsBravo">Girls Bravo</a></em>. Granted, he <em>tries</em> to stand up for himself when people ridicule him but he usually ends up backing down. People mock him for this by saying "You're too much of a coward to talk back! If you're a man then act like one!" Also, he takes frequent beatings from his friend Kirie for being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPervert">Accidental Pervert</a> and hardly ever complains to her about it afterwards. He also never decides to say, stop being friends with her and frequently blames himself for when bad things happen to him.
</li><li> Ayumi of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GokinjoMonogatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GokinjoMonogatari">Gokinjo Monogatari</a></em>. When she's chosen as the receptionist at the fashion contest and can't move from the hall, she even gets a comment from Yuusuke, that it suits her just perfectly.
</li><li> Hinata from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/H2OFootprintsInTheSand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/H2OFootprintsInTheSand">H₂O: Footprints in the Sand</a></em> acts this way initially towards her grandfather.

Ultimately, her loyalty lies to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">Kyon</a>, more than her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Boss</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader">The Leader</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Haruhi</a>.
<ul><li> Present-day Mikuru seems to fit this trope. It's hinted that Mikuru is less of a 100% doormat than she looks like, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">pretending to be super ultra submissive in order to hide her true identity</a>. Plus there's evidence that if Mikuru <em>wasn't</em> an extreme doormat, Haruhi would <em>make</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">her one</a>. Future-Mikuru, on the other hand...
</li></ul></li><li> The Captain from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em> basically follows Major around like a big, quiet dog that doesn't do anything unless commanded to. Which sort of makes sense considering <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's a werewolf</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HoneyHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HoneyHunt">Honey Hunt</a></em>: Yura, up until her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a> divorce and reveal they couldn't care less about her. This results in her first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">Moment of Awesome</a> when she tearfully announces to the press that she no longer considers them her parents and that "people like them should just burn in hell". Even after that though, she still shows instances of this trope at times.
</li><li> Hatsumi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HotGimmick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HotGimmick">Hot Gimmick</a></em> is so spineless she nearly defines this trope.
<ul><li> A spoilery example to back that up: Hatsumi is so spectacularly doormat-like that she actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">apologizes to a guy while he's having her gang-raped by his friends. She's apologizing because of something her father did to the gang-rapist's mother, which prompted the gang-rapist to attack Hatsumi as a form of proxy revenge. I repeat: she's apologizing to her rapist for something she didn't even do.</span> The cherry on top: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">we later find out that it was <em>someone else's</em> father who wronged the gang-rapist's mother, not Hatsumi's. The whole thing was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory">"Shaggy Dog" Story</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Soushi of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuXBokuSS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuXBokuSS">Inu × Boku SS</a></em>, who became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalButtKisser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalButtKisser">Professional Butt-Kisser</a> in order to appeal to his higher ups and worm his way to freedom from a life-long house arrest. One of his previous masters noted that he'd willingly do an embarrassing act with a smile on his face. He's something of a subversion since he uses this tactic to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">achieve his own ends</a>, but it's also true he assigns so little value to his life that he'd even commit suicide if that was what was wished of him.
</li><li> Kuroe Akaishi of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaijuGirlCaramelise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaijuGirlCaramelise">Kaiju Girl Caramelise</a></em> starts off as this, as she feels that it's not worth sticking up for herself if it means interacting with people long enough for them to see one of her emotion-triggered transformations. The first chapter alone shows her awkwardly, silently requesting her desk back when Nagiko steals it to get better pictures of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet">Arata Minami</a> for social media posts; when it's clear that Nagiko won't give it back, Kuroe silently walks away.
</li><li> Tsuna from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Katekyō Hitman Reborn!</a></em>, though he gets better somewhat. Kozato Enma even more so. They become fast friends mainly because of how they can relate to each other in this aspect.
</li><li> Byaku from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kekkaishi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kekkaishi">Kekkaishi</a></em> is an example of this trope who is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of a major arc. Having no drive or desires of his own, he spends both his flashback and the main story fulfilling wishes of whatever woman happens to be next to him, no matter how potentially dangerous to him, her and innocent bystanders, not because he loves them or anything, but seemingly because he can't think of anything better to do <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">although the manga suggests that he loved Hime after all.</span> This is presented as extremely creepy.
</li><li> Sawako from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimiNiTodoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimiNiTodoke">Kimi ni Todoke</a></em> is this normally, but it's subverted when she refuses to help Kurumi get together with Kazehaya, on the basis she can't support her fully due to her own feelings for Kazehaya.
</li><li> The titular character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KomorisanCantDecline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KomorisanCantDecline">Komori-san Can't Decline!</a></em> is a girl who can't decline requests. Downplayed however, since she <em>does</em> say no every so often. The joke of the series, however, is that she becomes extremely competent at nearly anything she does, provided she's been asked to do it, first.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KotouraSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KotouraSan">Kotoura-san</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy">titular</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">heroine</a>. Haruka doesn't speak up because she would likely and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive">unintentionally</a> reveal <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatemae">people's inner selves<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which often infuriates them even more and validates their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbominationAccusationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbominationAccusationAttack">Abomination Accusation Attack</a> hence why she's the perfect victim from their perspective. Because of this, she doesn't even bother trying to be social which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurtingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurtingHero">is affecting her mental health</a> despite how much her she denies it. Much of the show is devoted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">having her growing away from this</a>.
</li><li> Lucciola in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LastExile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LastExile">Last Exile</a></em> starts out this way, but his loyalty and friendship to Dio helped him take the initiative to save him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">And then he dies. * Sniff* </a></span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LittleHouseWithAnOrangeRoof" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LittleHouseWithAnOrangeRoof">Little House with an Orange Roof</a></em>: For a tsundere, Natsumi has serious problems saying "no", especially when challenged to "prove" she's worthy to marry Shoutarou. This has led to her being groped by slimy salarymen in a cabaret, and being utilized for slave labor by her in-laws, among other things.
</li><li> Keitaro of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina">Love Hina</a></em>. He constantly lets the girls walk all over him and beat him up, even though as the landlord of the girls dormitory where they live, he could EASILY evict them at any point. In fact, it's ONLY because he's a doormat that the girls still have a roof over their heads!
</li><li> Soubi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Loveless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Loveless">Loveless</a>.</em> Ritsuka tries to break him out of it, but Seimei would prefer he stay that way.

<ul><li> Justified because she remembers <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">how Precia treated Alicia</span>, and doesn't know that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">those aren't her memories</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Minor character Miya from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiOtome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiOtome">Mai-Otome</a></em> is an unhappy and unwilling accomplice to all of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tomoe's</span> misdeeds, but is afraid to stand up to her. She ultimately <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gets blamed for everything and is forced to leave school permanently, never to be seen again</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MekkoRarekko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MekkoRarekko">Mekko Rarekko</a></em>, we have two of them.
<ul><li> First we have Buchi that was bullied a lot while in elementary school. He did make a friend in first grade Hamamura, but out of nowhere he told Buchi that he's no friend of his and Buchi has wondered what he to do make him hate him. We also learn that Hamamura also bullied Buchi after that for a while. He held everything inside and he didn't show anyone any emotions because he didn't want anyone to hate him. Especially his only friend Yamano Taishou. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He even held his feelings in when he was raped by Taishou in the second volume just because he didn't want to be hated. In the fifth volume, after Fukami rapes him, Fukami realizes this and that's one of the reasons that he moved away. In the seventh volume, after having a talk with a friend, Buchi admits that he's an Extreme Doormat and that he held his emotions because he didn't want to be hated by his friends.</span>
</li><li> Taishou isn't as extreme (no pun intended) as Buchi, but when he was in first grade, he always wanted to be close to Amanuma because he looked up to him back then and he thought he was cool. However Amanuma was basically great at everything in school unlike Taishou who was an average student at best. Because of that, Amanuma would bully and even torture Taishou a lot. Eventually it got so bad that Taishou had to transfer to a new school to get away from Amanuma's cruelty.
</li></ul></li><li> Hong Long from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em> is a prime example. Not only does he suffer from being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">the less desired child in his family</a>, but he spends his time taking Wang Liu Mei's abuse and criticism without resentment. The ultimate example of this is at the end of his run where, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after they escape the destruction of the Trinity Mothership, they are cornered by Nena Trinity, who has grown tired of being treated as a utility by Liu Mei. As she plans to put a bullet in her, Hong Long takes the shot... and another, and another. Pushing Liu Mei out of harm's way and telling her to live, he confronts Nena... and gets a bullet in his head for his troubles. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice">Not only does Liu Mei not appreciate it, but Nena STILL gets her revenge.</a></span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster">Monster</a></em>, Tenma starts off as a complete bitch of his fiancee and his boss, who publishes his research under his own name and takes credit for his extremely difficult surgeries. Although he grows a spine early in the series' run, both his and Eva's flashbacks characterize him as woefully passive and exploitable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Hinata was shown to be one of these during her childhood. Her interactions with Naruto enable her to grow out of it.
</li><li> Don't forget about Sakura. She's this around Sasuke, especially in Part I. The scene in the hospital shows it quite well, with Sakura not doing anything to call Sasuke out on his actions.
</li><li> <em>Itachi</em> of all people, fits this trope pretty well, combining it with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong">My Country, Right or Wrong</a>. What's that, Danzou? You need me to kill my entire clan to prevent a war? No problem! Okay, it's not that simple, but you get the point.
</li><li> Speaking of Danzo, his ideal of a shinobi leans toward this: An individual with exceptional combat skills, a willingness to die for his country, and no emotions or opinions to prevent him from doing so. He does his best to mold Root in this image but falls short himself, to his own disgust.
</li><li> Unfortunately for the Shinobi, this is also true for the Daimyo. They all seem to be pretty spineless, not to mention stupid.. And they're supposed to lead the country?
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>:
<ul><li> Shinji, the protagonist, has, due to extreme issues with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">Parental Abandonment</a> (his mother died when he was young, and his emotionally distant father left him in the care of a guardian shortly afterwards) developed a subconscious belief that he is unwanted and has no value as a person and he therefore has no real drive to anything for and by himself, leading him to adopt a life philosophy of keeping his head down and doing what he is told.
</li><li> There is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">Rei</a>, who shows no emotion, carries out any order given to her with absolute obedience, and has no problem being considered completely expendable for the sake of the mission. On one occasion, she even admitted that she would kill herself without a second thought if Gendo ordered her to; there's a reason Asuka calls her a wind-up doll.
</li></ul></li><li> Lala-Ru from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NowAndThenHereAndThere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NowAndThenHereAndThere">Now and Then, Here and There</a></em> is an Extreme Doormat in all but one respect. She can provide water with the use of her pendant, which is an invaluable ability in her desert planet... so much so that wars have been fought over her, often <em>civil</em> wars. She has thus retreated into extreme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">stoicism</a> and refuses to give anyone water when told, since it just causes death. In this regard, she is more steely than an iron mine, taking heaps of abuse and threats (and implied rape) rather than give in. By the series' end, she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen">Defrosting Ice Queen</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">Mama Bear</a>, using her power to help save Sho and her loved ones.</span> Super ending spoiler: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she even makes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to fill the planet with oceans.</span>
<ul><li> Abelia is also this towards King Hamdo for most of the series. No matter how much he shrieks and rants and raves at her, or how insane/barbaric his orders, she quietly carries out his instructions and never, ever speaks back or shows signs of being disgruntled. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She gets over it.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> has a minor villain in the Dressrosa Arc named Baby 5. She cannot say no to <em>anyone</em>. Because of this, she's been engaged multiple times, and has a debt of nearly a hundred million. Even in battle, she accepted a sarcastic request from her enemy to just die and was prepared to shoot herself before that same enemy stopped her. While this was at first played for laughs, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight">Harsher in Hindsight</a> when her backstory was revealed. She was abandoned by her parents as a small child, with the last thing her mother said to her being "you're of no use to anyone." This is why she's so utterly desperate to feel needed. Even so, when one of her fellow villains says <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImStandingRightHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImStandingRightHere">right in front of her</a> that their group only values her because she's "convenient" (and not because they actually care about her at all), she breaks down crying.</span>
</li><li> Yaya Higuchi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Othello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Othello">Othello</a></em> has been tolerating all her life being bullied and being toyed with by her supposed friends, without <em>ever</em> following her own wishes. Her cosplay hobby helped her to escape reality, but once this is discovered, she develops the Nana personality. However, since her original personality isn't aware of Nana's existence, she thinks she's going crazy and losing her memory, making her even more pitiful. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> By the end of the manga, she learns to stand up for herself.</span>
</li><li> Gilbert Nightray of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PandoraHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PandoraHearts">PandoraHearts</a></em> is often this to his master Oz, but with Alice he normally stands up to her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu">Princess Tutu</a></em>, Mytho starts out as an extreme doormat, since he kinda <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartTrauma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartTrauma">shattered his heart</a>, rendering him completely emotionless. The only thing he ever does of his own volition (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">at first</a>) is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">protecting the weak</a>.
</li><li> Mousse of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> but only if Shampoo is doing the walking. In a later manga story: the Mask of Submission is a pair of glasses that causes whoever is seen through them to kneel and grovel, <em>begging</em> to be trod upon. He uses them on Ranma a few times to satisfy his ego, then Shampoo, the girl he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> towards, asked him to stop using them. Upon his initial refusal, she told him he was pathetic for taking advantage of items created to protect those who had no other way to fight off martial artists.

He's saved from living here by being opinionated and obstinate in everything else.
<ul><li> In "Hunted", he's kidnapped and used as bait after Sam just abandoned him in the middle of the night, dismissed him with a "he means well", and didn't even try to contact him until he needed him. And all Dean can come up with is a "You ever do that again and I'll...". Do what, Dean? Grow a spine when it comes to dealing with your family?

While she does get angry at Peter's tendencies to embarrass her and other shenanigans he puts the family through, Lois always forgives him at the end of the episode and has never even thought about leaving him. She'll also rarely stand up for Peter whenever her father puts him down.

In the hurricane episode, Meg finally snaps and tells off her whole family by showing them just how horrible they are as a family and as human beings. This causes everyone else in the family to turn against each other for their terrible and annoying flaws while Meg walks away from it. In the end, she realizes that without her, the Griffin family will turn against each other to let out their aggressions and her being the punching bag was the only thing that kept any form of peace in the household.

Despite being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a>, he is so insecure that he finds it difficult to say no to anyone, no matter how unreasonable their requests are. Max typically drags him into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme">Zany Schemes</a> despite his objections, while his father treats him like a slave on several occasions. Even his little sister pushes him around. He typically puts up a token resistance with Max (who always manages to break him without trouble), and no resistance at all with his father, mostly displaying his resentment while alone, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">there are a few occasions he's pushed too far</a>. He also takes verbal abuse and rejection without fighting back.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em>: Phoebe served as this for her friend Helga at times. One episode had her get tired of this after Helga's actions lead her to get hit by a car and she gets Helga to be this for her. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Things go back to the way they were by the end of the episode though</a>.
</li><li> MODOK in the animated <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em> series (from the '90s) has aspects of this trope, constantly putting up with the Mandarin belittling him and even having to be persuaded out of helping him enact a plan that would KILL HIM. When asked why he puts up with it he answers "He makes me laugh. Seriously, I <em>like</em> him."
</li><li> There was a short-lived Terrytoons character called <em>John Doormat</em>. However, this is only when he's with his wife; when's he's at work he's actually a mean, scary boss.
<ul><li> Which would make this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">far too many cases</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em>: Eugly the rabbit. She's willing to do anything <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">her sister</a> tells her to do, even though she's constantly being mean to her.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em>, Bill can fit this trope sometimes, although it can be tragic just as much as it's played for laughs. He was really a go-getter guy when he was in high school and pretty tough and likable, but his current doormat status is implied to partly be because he joined the army, but mostly due to his leeching, cheating, dominating ex-wife Lenore, who left him with a broken heart and a missing spine.
<div class="indent"><strong>Bill:</strong> When people yell at me, I usually do what they say!
</div><ul><li> Bobby can be like this too, mainly because even for someone his age, he's astonishing easy to influence and can be pushed into behaving in strange ways just from being <em>around</em> certain people.
</li><li> Cotton's second wife Didi is maybe the most extreme possible version of this. She's always shown as quiet, depressed, and submitted, all of which are desirable traits in a spouse to the Jerkass Cotton Hill. With little free will of her own, she seems more like a slave than a wife.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em>: Norman from "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/NormanNormal1968" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/NormanNormal1968">Norman Normal</a>" is a nebbishy businessman who follows his father's advice to "not make waves" to a fault, being easily pressured by his boss into getting a sale through unscrupulous means and laughing at jokes he doesn't find funny just to fit in. The only hint of a backbone he shows is at the end, when he angrily storms out of a cocktail party after getting mocked by the bartender and telling a needy, annoying friend "Go soak your head!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLooneyTunesShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLooneyTunesShow">The Looney Tunes Show</a></em>'s incarnation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PorkyPig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PorkyPig">Porky Pig</a> will put up with or go along with anything because he's soft-hearted and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends">wants to have friends</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny">Bugs Bunny</a> is determined to make him more assertive, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaffyDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaffyDuck">Daffy Duck</a> takes advantage of him on a daily basis.
</li><li> Mr. Milk from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MakingFiends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MakingFiends">Making Fiends</a></em> has quite a few doormat qualities, although it's mostly because he's stuck being school teacher to local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> Vendetta. Having an evil red bird fiend constantly keeping him in check doesn't help much either.
</li><li> Mole from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MrBogus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MrBogus">Mr. Bogus</a></em> finds himself in this trope very frequently. It makes a lot of sense, since he often serves as Ratty's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SycophanticServant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SycophanticServant">Sycophantic Servant</a> and will very blithely listen to anything that he says.
</li><li> The Bushwoolies from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a></em> were frequently troubled by the difficulty they had disagreeing with anyone, especially each other; their leader Hugster seemed to be the only one who really had a mind of his own. It was probably all they could do to decide to rebel in "Escape from Katrina" in the first place.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> Fluttershy, who kowtows to pretty much everything under the sun. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">Don't push it, though</a>. And don't threaten her friends: Fluttershy doesn't stand up for <em>herself</em>, but standing up for her friends <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">is another story entirely</a></em>. An episode revolves around her doormattitude, which has been turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> for the sake of the episode; she's even pushed around by Angel Bunny, who up until now tended to make it his job to keep everyone else's pushing around to a minimum. So she goes to a seminar on assertiveness, which causes a complete personality 180. She actually calls Pinkie Pie and Rarity worthless to their faces before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">Heel Realization</a> rolls around.
</li><li> In Season 6, we find out her parents are even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">worse</a></em> about it, which her freeloading brother gleefully takes advantage of. Apparently <em>she</em> was always the assertive one in her family.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow">The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show</a></em>. Stimpy appears to be like this sometimes for Ren. However, that's the gag: it isn't so much that he's a doormat (extreme or not), it's more that he's...well, an "eediot".<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2v0kt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2v0kt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2v0kt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It's implied that he literally doesn't know any better. It's never really clear either way. It doesn't help that Ren takes advantage of him every chance he gets...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">except when he doesn't</a>.</span>
</li><li> The title character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife">Rocko's Modern Life</a></em> fits this trope perfectly. He lets everyone (mainly his friends Heffer and Filburt) take advantage of his kindness, and no matter how many times they wrong him, Rocko is quick to forgive them even though he knows full well they will wrong him again in the future.
</li><li> Slinkman from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CampLazlo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CampLazlo">Camp Lazlo</a></em>, particularly when it comes to Scoutmaster Lumpus in earlier episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Sidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Sidekick">Sidekick</a></em>: Golly Gee Kid the janitor, in his sidekick days, this is basically his job as Maxum Man's sidekick.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Waylon Smithers, an assistant to Mr. Burns. For much of the series he helps with Burns' schemes almost unquestioningly, but he may be a subversion in that there are some schemes even he will object to at the risk of losing his job. (See "Who Shot Mr. Burns Part 1.")
</li><li> As Homer became more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a>, Marge appeared to be more and more of a doormat, forgiving him over and over again, not only for stupid accidents and acts of ignorance, but huge acts of genuine deceit. While Bart and Lisa weren't willing to put up with it in many cases, Marge overlooked almost everything he did.
<ul><li> Finally addressed in the movie where Marge declares she had put up with Homer's jerkass nature and shenanigans long enough and decides to leave him. Homer spends the rest of the movie figuring out why Marge left him and what he can do to correct it.
</li><li> One episode lampshades this behavior of hers. The family is kicked out of town because of Homer's drunken antics, Bart's destructive pranks, and Lisa's expensive environmental initiatives. At the townhall meeting when Marge tries to defend the family she's told she's the worst of them all for always turning the other way and acting as an enabler to their behavior.
</li></ul></li><li> Ned Flanders (specially post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a>). He's a bit of a pushover, and easily lets Homer insulting him or taking advantage of him. In their first meeting, when he asks Homer if he needs something, Homer agrees to "borrow" the TV tray that Ned has just bought for himself. Eight years later the tray is still in the Simpsons' living room.
</li><li> Kirk Van Houten.
</li><li> A notable example is Seymour Skinner, obsessed with being the "perfect son" for his mother Agnes and not capable of say NO to her. One episode even had him win an award for being the biggest doormat in Springfield and was represented in said scene with a doormat with a picture of his face on it.
</li></ul></li><li> Pushover in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em> episode "The Smurf Who Couldn't Say No", who basically is a Smurf who has trouble saying no until he accidentally causes the Marsh Monster to be released by extinguishing the ancient Foxfire Flame in the Great Swamp, and then he and Scaredy return to the swamp to relight the flame and Pushover insists on Scaredy doing the honors. By the time the episode ends, Pushover is no longer a pushover!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>:
<ul><li> Liane Cartman, Eric Cartman's mom. She will give her son anything and everything he wants to ridiculous extremes, without objection.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">One episode focused on this</a>, with the Dog Whisperer basically explaining that her social ineptitude means her son is the only real companionship she has, which is why she will do anything to make him happy so she can spend time with him. This is one of the reasons Cartman is such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> and a spoiled brat.
</li><li> And in a more recent episode, She <em>finally</em> decided enough was enough and started denying Cartman...only to have him convince everyone that she repeatedly raped him—<em>in public</em>.
</li><li> However, in recent years, it seems that she will occasionally stand up to him and put her foot down. He'll whine and complain about it, but more often than before, she stands firm.
</li></ul></li><li> Chris from the two-part episode "Do The Handicapped Go To Hell?"/"Probably" is also an example of this, as he lets the rude/abusive Saddam walk all over him during the episode and reacts very passive-aggressively to Satan cheating on him.
</li><li> Butters in his pre-breakout days. Though he sometimes sill qualifies when he's not playing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woobie">Woobie</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassAdorable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassAdorable">Badass Adorable</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> is this to the extreme; several episodes show he's virtually incapable of saying no to <em>anyone</em>, and in "Walking Small," he's so passive that he actually lets a random fish sit on him without a fight. Several episodes show him try to grow a spine, only to conclude that he's fine with being stepped on... sometimes literally.
<ul><li> That being said, as shown in "Can You Spare a Dime?", SpongeBob <em>does</em> have his limits on how much abuse and exploitation he can take, though it took <em>several months</em> of Squidward <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingAdvantageOfGenerosity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingAdvantageOfGenerosity">taking advantage of his kindness</a> before he reached that point.
</li></ul></li><li> Luxor the cat from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tutenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tutenstein">Tutenstein</a></em>, thanks to the magic that compels him to serve the pharaoh.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> had the episode "One Little Word", where Stan is portrayed as a doormat for his boss Avery Bullock, constantly at his beck and call no matter how inconvenient or demeaning his orders are. In particular, Bullock is having an affair and orders Stan to help cover it up and take care of his mistress, all while Stan is supposed to be on vacation with his wife Francine. At the end of the episode, Stan finally decides to say "no" to Bullock...but he does this immediately after he's been shot by his enraged wife and is on the floor pleading for help (and Francine, who'd spent the whole episode trying to get Stan to assert himself, is practically begging him to call 911).
</li><li> Amethyst in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Trollz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Trollz">Trollz</a></em> realizes this about herself after watching old movies, where she only ever did what everyone else wanted to do.
