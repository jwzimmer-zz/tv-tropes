</div></div><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger">Cliffhangers</a> tend to be a vital part of any serial story. They stop the action or drama right when tension is at its highest, leaving an audience on the edge of their seats in anticipation of a conflict resolution and wanting to stick around to see what happens next.
</p><p>The best cliffhangers pick up the story right where it left off and provide a clear resolution based off of everything that was shown to have occurred to viewers in the previous installment. And then there's these...
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Unfortunately, sometimes writers may discover that they've written themselves into a corner with no way to resolve a cliffhanger based on how the prior episode, chapter, film, or story ended. When this problem arises, the writer may make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">saving throw</a> to cheat his way out of the problem in one of a few ways:
</p><p></p><ul><li> Facts about a character's circumstances are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retroactively</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Waved</a> between installments (e.g., the hero tied to a chair in a building rigged to blow up who wasn't able to even break his bonds prior to the building exploding at the conclusion of one episode is seen breaking free and escaping at the beginning of the next before the bombs go off). Depending on the circumstances, this can lead to some pretty glaring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole">Plot Holes</a>.
</li><li> What is seemingly promised to happen at the conclusion of one installment turns out to be something else entirely or an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnreveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnreveal">Unreveal</a> at the beginning of the next chapter.

The new information may be picked up and addressed later in the episode (probably with a reminder since we had a week to forget about it), but it never seems so crucial or urgent as it did at the end of the last episode.
</li><li> More <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregiously</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a> leading up to the cliffhanger is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">aborted</a> and/or explained away as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a>.
</li></ul><p>If handled well enough, most viewers may not notice it, or even care all that much if they take the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra">MST3K Mantra</a> to heart. If not, a lot of people are going to feel duped and not very pleased with what they were rewarded with for their dedicated viewership.
</p><p>Can be observed frequently in old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmSerial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmSerial">Film Serials</a> of the 1930s-40s; it also makes this trope just slightly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTelevision">Older Than Television</a>.

By the start of Episode 5, the heroes have already been rescued except the native girl who has been captured. Also, flying submarine aircraft carriers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>: Goku claims he saw a pod ship near Freeza's spaceship and took off before Freeza's spaceship hit the lava. The episode where Freeza's spaceship falls into the lava clearly shows Goku watching Freeza's ship fall into lava up in the air and then the planet explodes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationInducedPlothole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationInducedPlothole">Note that in the manga, that scene doesn't happen.</a>

Deidara decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">self destruct and take Sasuke with him</a>, setting off an absolutely enormous explosion, and Sasuke is out of chakra. The next chapter reveals that Sasuke somehow summoned Manda the Boss of All Snakes and most powerful of the Summons, mind controlled it, jumped in its mouth, and teleported it away; all things take large amounts of chakra, <em>which Sasuke had just been shown to be out of in the previous chapter</em>, and he did all this in the time it took the explosion to reach him when it had already gone off right next to him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Muyo!</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> during Kiyone's introductory episode in <em>Tenchi Universe</em>.

</li><li> Happens frequently in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nisekoi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nisekoi">Nisekoi</a></em>. The end of many chapters, particularly in the second half of the series, suddenly steers that chapter's story towards one of the many series-long mysteries, such as the identity of the girl who promised Raku she'll marry him, the locket with the missing key, or the children's book with the torn-out final page. Except for the last dozen chapters or so, the beginning of the following chapter will invariably lead the characters to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a>, lead them to a dead end, segue to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrypticConversation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrypticConversation">Cryptic Conversation</a> that goes nowhere, or get interrupted by a different problem requiring the characters' immediate attention.

<ul><li> In issue 24 (Volume 2), the kids have finally dragged Chase back, they've beaten their foes once and for all, and they're tired and weary as they arrive home... To find Iron Man and a bunch of mooks waiting. In Issue 25, they begin by...

</li><li> At the end of their ongoing series, the last shot is of Chase getting hit by a truck, away from the rest of the group. He apparently survives and reunites with the others off-screen, and he is totally fine by the time they run into Daken in his series. Daken even asks what happened to him and all Chase answers with is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery">I got better.</a>"
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted in a 1960s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> story. At the end of one issue, our hero jumps out of a plane, wearing a parachute. At the start of the next issue, Captain America is falling through the air with no parachute (and no explanation of where the parachute went). The first few pages explain how the Captain survives this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee">Stan Lee</a> later admitted that when he wrote the later issue, he had forgotten how he ended the earlier issue.
</li><li> One old <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a></em> issue ended with The Leader pushing a button that would launch a missile.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> One issue was a hugely emotional for Peter Parker; him asking his clone to take care of his wife, and in general as heartfelt a sendoff as you could ask for a beloved character. The first thing that happens in the following issue is his corpse convulsing back to life with his super-powers restored.
</li><li> The "Gathering of Five" arc ends with Green Goblin receiving a massive power boost and killing Spider-Man. The following issue it's revealed Gobby had gone crazy and most of the previous issue had been his hallucinations.

The issue ends with the radiation shielding giving out, and Jean faces certain, horrific death... two months later, issue #101 comes out, and the <em>cover itself</em> reveals Jean's fine and dandy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">More than that, actually.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a></em> v3 #46 ends with a Mandroid about to sever Logan's neck and spine with an adamantium buzzsaw. The next issue opens the same way, except the Mandroid realizes the buzzsaw he's holding isn't made of adamantium and can't cut through.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CountdownToFinalCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CountdownToFinalCrisis">Countdown to Final Crisis</a></em>, one such instance features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash">Wally West</a> employing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique">Jack Bauer Interrogation Technique</a> on Pied Piper and the Trickster by yanking a pair of cuffs attached to the two that's programmed to shock the both of them if something happens to it, and threatens to continue it until they tell him what happened to his murdered cousin Bart Allen. The following issue reveals that Piper and Trickster just imagined Wally pulling on the cuffs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em> vol. 4, #3 had Hal Jordan fly into the Yellow Central Power Battery with a Green Lantern (the object), with the goal of basically forcing the thing to enter its failsafe mode and shut down once a Green Lantern enters it. This plan was even devised by Sinestro himself, who created the Yellow Central Power Battery. Instead, the Power Battery disintegrates him, with it even saying "disintegration compete". The next issue instead opens with the Power Battery recognising that Hal isn't Sinestro, and instead aborts its attempt to transport Hal to the anti-matter universe (why it was doing this is not explained).
</li><li> Routinely done deliberately and for laughs in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Viz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Viz">Viz</a></em> strip "Billy the Fish." Typically, the villain who is menacing the club will turn out to be a just a cardboard cutout with a tape recorder on the back or that one of the club had arranged for Jeremy Beadle to play a trick on his teammates.

<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7SyRZlsbP8">Chapter 13, "Eight Steps Down"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, ends with Batman stuck in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap">Death Trap</a> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWallsAreClosingIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWallsAreClosingIn">spiked walls are closing in</a> on him which is cut away from just before the walls are about to crush our hero with no hope in sight for rescue. Then, the beginning of <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muRg_TGzCqs">Chapter 14, "The Executioner Strikes,"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> shows Robin appearing <em>much earlier</em> during the same scene with more than enough time to slip Batman a crowbar to brace the walls moving in.
</li><li> In turn, the conclusion of <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tld8Tm9mt8">Chapter 14<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> shows Batman locked in a box and dropped in an alligator pit only for <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbCRVZCCC_g">the next chapter<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to show that Robin managed to break Batman free in secret much earlier and had put a hapless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mook</a> back in the box in Batman's place.
</li><li> The conclusion of Chapter 10 and beginning of Chapter 11 show Batman miraculously jumping out from a car before it careens off a bridge and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto">bursts into a fireball</a>.
</li><li> Another particularly bad one: Batman falling several stories and visibly slamming into the ground is resolved by it not being Bruce in the suit, but a minor villain who decided to put it on for no apparent reason. This was actually telegraphed in the scene right before the cliffhanger actually showing Bruce walking away and putting on his hat, but it's blink-and-you-miss-it.
</li><li> Another episode ends with Batman in a plane that crashes in a fiery explosion. The next episode shows him just staggering out of the wreckage a little dazed while the mooks who were also on the plane both died from the crash.
</li></ul></li><li> This was so common in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UnderseaKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UnderseaKingdom">Undersea Kingdom</a></em> serial that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undersea_Kingdom#Cliffhangers">keeps a list of these.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Joel and the Bots</a> watched the first two chapters in the serial where the cliffhanger saw Crash and Billy trapped on top of a cliff while it collapses underneath them from missile fire, the resolution in the following installment shows Crash and Billy climbing back down from the cliff before the collapse, prompting Tom Servo to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">reference</a> the line from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Misery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Misery">Misery</a></em>, "How did they get off the cock-a-doodie cliff? This is <em>wrong!</em>"
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePurpleMonsterStrikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePurpleMonsterStrikes">The Purple Monster Strikes</a></em> (Republic, 1945) has quite a few of these, but the most insulting is the cliffhanger to Chapter 7, "The Evil Eye": a bomb is wired to an electric eye in a doorway, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoundAndGagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoundAndGagged">Bound and Gagged</a> inside. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> arrives, and we <em>clearly see him</em> step into the electric eye, which triggers the 5-second timer and the building blows up. In the next episode, we're shown that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a> manages to <em>de-gag herself</em> and alert the Hero <em>just before</em> he steps into the electric eye, and he then <em>jumps over it</em>. A moment later, once safely out of the building, he turns and shoots a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mook</a> back in the building, and <em>he</em> falls into the electric eye and sets off the bomb. Cop out, indeed.
<ul><li> Close second would be the end of Chapter 9, "The Living Dead", which featured the Hero in a closing spiked cage similar to the Batman example above. The cliffhanger showed the spikes closing in nearly to the point of puncturing the hero's body... the next episode backed the walls up considerably so the hero could use his gun as a stopper, holding the spiked wall at bay until the pressure <em>broke the cage</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em>, when Joel and the Bots had to view chapters from the Commando Cody <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RadarMenFromTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RadarMenFromTheMoon">Radar Men from the Moon</a></em> serial, Joel would always make some kind of comment whenever it came time for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> of the previous chapter's conclusion to reveal itself. For instance, during Chapter 4 (aired alongside <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RobotMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RobotMonster">Robot Monster</a></em>) <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0sgh7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0sgh7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0sgh7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(Cody chasing bad guys across a bridge and gets blown off by a boobytrap...except that he dived out of the car in time {really})</span>:

The play stands: Cody is <em>dead</em>.
</div><ul><li> This happens in Chapter 2 as well, when Cody just manages to roll out from behind the panel just as Retik shoots it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreenHornetSerials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreenHornetSerials">The Green Hornet Serials</a></em> had plenty.
<ul><li> <em>From "The Green Hornet"</em>
<ul><li> Chapter 3 ends with the Hornet in a crashing plane. In Chapter 4, the Hornet somehow acquires enough time and altitude to bail out safely. Having a parachute in the first place is <em>not</em> a copout, as we see him put it on in Chapter 3.
</li><li> At the end of Chapter 7, the Hornet and his opponent are in the back of a truck when the bridge gives out underneath them. At the start of Chapter 8, both men fall out of the truck just before it reaches the bridge.
</li><li> In Chapter 9, the Hornet is trapped by Axford and Jenks. Axford shoots through the door of the storage closet the Hornet is hiding in, breaking some chemical bottles. The chapter ends with the Hornet passing out from the fumes. When Chapter 10 starts, Reid has enough time to ditch his disguise before pretending to pass out.
</li><li> Chapter 11 ends with the Hornet and a crook fighting in a caboose, which derails when the other crooks uncouple the end cars. They are clearly seen in the caboose as it tumbles. Chapter 12 shows both men falling out of the caboose before it derails. For bonus copout points, the crooks wanted to uncouple the cars to put pressure on a shipping company. The recap scroll says the companys cars were uncoupled, but when one crook reports back to Monroe he says the train broke apart <em>behind</em> the target cars, and the shipping companys cars got through safely.
</li><li> Chapter 12 ends with the Hornet and an extortionist fighting in a burning office. When Chapter 13 starts, there's no sign of fire...<em>and</em> both the Hornet and the crook have forgotten about last chapter's confession.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>From "The Green Hornet Strikes Again!"</em>
<ul><li> Chapter 5 ends with a warehouse full of illegal munitions being bombed, and the Hornet at Ground Zero. Chapter 6 starts with the Hornet having enough time to take cover in the basement.
</li><li> Chapter 7 ends with the Hornets plane crashing after being an accidental test subject for a new antiaircraft weapon. At the start of Chapter 8, he has just enough time for a no-parachute bailout.
</li><li> In Chapter 11, the Hornet and some truck hijackers are fighting when the truck goes over a cliff. There's a different camera angle spliced in for Chapter 12, showing the Hornet jumping out at the last minute.
</li><li> Theres another warehouse with illegal explosives in Chapter 12. The chapter ends with the Hornet ramming a racketeer's car through the warehouse door, hitting the explosives, and big boom. Chapter 13 gives him enough time to see the crates of explosives and dive out before the car hits them.
</li><li> Chapter 14 ends with the Hornet and a racketeer fighting in the racketeer's open car, which goes off the road and wrecks during the fight. Chapter 15 starts with the Hornet being knocked out of the car just before the accident.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BuckRogers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BuckRogers">Buck Rogers</a></em> serial ended with Buck's friend Buddy collapsing after being shot as he was about to jump out of a window. The next serial starts with the shot missing, and Buddy escaping out of the window.
</li><li> The 1943 serial <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantom1943" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantom1943">The Phantom</a></em> is <em>relatively</em> honest. It makes heavy use of the kind where the cliffhanger is edited to make the situation appear more dire than it actually is, with the recap revealing that help was already on the way, or there was an escape tunnel just out of shot, or whatever. However, it always plays fair in that it only ever conceals information, never outright changes the events between chapters.

Paul had ended the last novel with Misery's burial, so Annie insisted that the new novel would start with a way of getting the heroine out of her grave, fair and square. He eventually comes up with the idea that Misery was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Not Quite Dead</a> from a bee-sting allergic reaction and was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuriedAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuriedAlive">Buried Alive</a>, and is quite proud of the idea.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Annie Wilkes:</strong> The bad guy stuck [Rocketman] in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the door shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death, and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could escape! And it crashed and burned, and I was so upset and excited, and the next week, you better believe I was first in line. And they always start with the end of the last week.

A particularly annoying one in the first book involves the main character falling over backwards at the end of one chapter and being caught immediately at the beginning of the next, which also means mining <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCliffhanger">an utter non-event for drama in the first place</a> <em>just</em> for the sake of not having it come to anything.

And then, this:

</li><li> From the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CaptainUnderpants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CaptainUnderpants">Captain Underpants</a></em> series, book 9 ends with Tippy Twinkletrousers apparently killed from being stepped on by a giant zombified student.

Newly hired authors tried to write a believable sequel, but any attempt to extricate Rocambole looked too far-fetched. The publisher had to renegotiate with du Terrail. And what did the original author do?

As the season ends, he's lying on the ground dying as Secret Service swarms over him, and the last sounds heard are his fading heartbeats. Cue the opening of the third season, and it turns out that Palmer's fine, and that he found and "punished" those responsible.

Then the next season starts and none of this is ever mentioned again. We eventually catch a glimpse of a published copy of the book, <em>From Peanut To President</em>, that Alda's character would only have had time to finish writing if he got his kidney. So presumably it all worked out somehow. Similarly, Kenneth must have somehow escaped the Chinese assassin in the second-season finale, since he's alive in the third season.

Famously, every other episode would end with the Dynamic Duo in a diabolical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap">Death Trap</a>, struggling against their bonds, desperately casting about for a means of escape, or glaring in fear and/or determination at their impending destruction while the narrator fretted about their certain doom. The next episode would begin with the Caped Crusaders escaping the trap, sometimes through legitimately inventive means, but just as often through copouts like "someone shows up to rescue them," "they'd prepared something earlier in the day and we didn't show you" or the ever-popular "they use a Bat-gadget they have on them for just such an emergency that they apparently briefly forgot they had during their moment of panic at the end of the last episode." If they were unconscious at the end of the previous episode, they'd generally just wake up. On one occasion they were saved by a power outage; on another, by an <strong>eclipse</strong>.

The cliffhanger is that the villain's thugs are about to do the same to Batman and Robin. The next-episode solution is ... they fight off the thugs. And it turns out the Hornet and Kato managed to roll off the conveyor belt going through the stamp machine and were hiding inside it. Where did those human-sized stamps with their images on them in the previous episode come from?

Season 4 opens with Piper and Phoebe in the attic discussing Prue's death. How did the three trapped in the underworld escape? How did Leo get home in time to save Piper? Were there any consequences for Phoebe breaking her oath? The latter two questions get some explanation at the beginning of Season 4, but the exact details of the characters' escape from the underworld itself are never made clear. The whole thing is justified in a meta-sense since Prue's actress Shannen Doherty left the show in between seasons so any plans the writers may have had were thrown out the window.

The resolution is... Pierce walking into the study room, explaining he'd changed his mind, and asking them to take him back. Probably deliberate, since it wasn't considered likely that Pierce would be gone from the group for good. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">Hilarious in Hindsight</a> seasons later when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">Chevy Chase's strained relations with the rest of the cast and crew finally broke</a>, leading his character to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BusCrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BusCrash">get in the way of a passing bus</a>.

JR holds the gun in his hand, and his brother Bobby hears a gunshot from downstairs. Bobby runs up, opens the door to JR's room with a look of shock on his face... and as the TV movie "JR Returns" would later explain, JR shot the mirror and climbed out the window, then fled to Paris to hide out for six months.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter">Dexter</a></em>. Several instances of something occurring that could have completely damned Dexter or caused problems were resolved a minute into the next episode. Of course, just as many times they were legitimate problems that Dexter spends the episode dealing with, but that just makes the Cliffhanger Copout and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PseudoCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PseudoCrisis">Pseudo Crisis</a> events stand out all the more.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> has done this numerous times, largely due to volume. <em>Every</em> non-terminal episode of the classic series ended in a cliffhanger, and terminal ones sometimes did too.

Sarah Jane is leading a prison escape up a giant scaffolding tower, when she slips and falls in a dramatic freeze-frame. Unfortunately, Part Three begins with her landing on a previously-unmentioned plank just below. The most frustrating thing is that she clearly fell on the outside of the tower, but the plank could only have been on the inside.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavison">Peter Davison</a> era in particular was mocked for the number of cliffhangers which had the Doctor and/or a companion about to be killed by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Dragon</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mook</a>, only for a superior villain to turn up as soon as the next episode started and order their lives spared.
</li><li> Famously, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS21E6TheCavesOfAndrozani" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS21E6TheCavesOfAndrozani">"The Caves of Androzani"</a>, you actually see the Doctor and Peri get shot, execution style, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCliffhanger">fall down dead</a>. The following episode resolves the conflict <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PseudoCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PseudoCrisis">ten seconds</a> in, when it is revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the executed parties were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyADoombot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyADoombot">actually robot look-a-likes</a></span>.
</li><li> A notorious cliffhanger from the Sixth Doctor story <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS22E3TheMarkOfTheRani" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS22E3TheMarkOfTheRani">"The Mark of the Rani"</a> involves the Doctor hurtling down a hill strapped to a gurney, headed for a mine's pithead. The reprise inserts shots not shown in the cliffhanger of the guest hero running toward the gurney, so that the resolution can be him saving the Doctor before he falls in the pit.
</li><li> The most (in)famous, not to mention <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralCliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralCliffhanger">literal</a>, example is probably from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS24E4Dragonfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS24E4Dragonfire">"Dragonfire"</a>; in which the Doctor <em>dangles himself over a precipice</em> on his brolly and starts losing his grip, gurning ridiculously while we see shots of an abyss under his feet. This happens for no obvious reason other than because the episode was coming to an end. In the next episode a friend suddenly appears and helps lower him onto another ledge that was not present in the abyss shot.
<ul><li> According to the script editor, the ledge he was on was supposed to come to an end, prompting him to try to get to the next one down and misjudge the distance, but the set was incorrectly realized so that it looked like he just decided to go over the edge. The new series pulled an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">Author's Saving Throw</a> on this one, revealing it as one of several cases where the Great Intelligence altered events in the Doctor's timeline to try to kill him.

The virus seems to pass by touch, so one touch will turn them all into zombies. The conclusion opens with the Doctor telling the zombies to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">go to their room</a>, and it works.
</li><li> At the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS28E5RiseOfTheCybermen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS28E5RiseOfTheCybermen">"Rise of the Cybermen"</a>, the Doctor tries to convince the Cybermen who've cornered his group that they're surrendering, only for the Cybermen to ignore this and ominously chant "Delete! Delete!" as the episode ends; when the following episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS28E6TheAgeOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS28E6TheAgeOfSteel">"The Age of Steel"</a> begins, the Doctor suddenly pulls a tool out of nowhere which kills the Cybermen then and there. Because if the Doctor had this tool at his disposal, there was little reason to try and surrender and even less to hesitate for about 10 seconds before killing the enemy; they don't even suggest that he was possibly trying to buy enough time until the tool was fully charged to destroy the Cybermen, which actually <em>make sense</em> if it's the case. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> by the "tool" actually being the TARDIS's charging power cell, whose use as a weapon started the charging process all over again. For obvious reasons, the Doctor was reluctant to cut off his ultimate escape route.
</li><li> At the end of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E12TheStolenEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E12TheStolenEarth">The Stolen Earth</a>", the Doctor is shot, dragged to the TARDIS by his companions and starts to regenerate, meanwhile Sarah Jane Smith is facing down two Daleks unarmed. 15 seconds into the following episode, series finale "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E13JourneysEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E13JourneysEnd">Journey's End</a>", the Doctor heals himself using the regeneration energy without changing, 15 seconds after that two characters who haven't appeared for two seasons appear to rescue Sarah Jane. This is helped a bit by the show later confirming that it did indeed count as a regeneration, bringing the Doctor one step closer to true death after his thirteenth life.

Next week, the pre-credit teaser actually adds an <em>extra</em> cliffhanger to the excitement by revealing that somehow Amy and the Doctor exchanged places. Post credits, the Doctor from the future, already out of the Pandorica, just goes back in time and lets himself out (putting dead Amy inside the preserve her).

</li></ul></li><li> The "Moldavian Massacre" on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dynasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dynasty">Dynasty</a></em> is an (in)famous case of this. At the end of the fifth season, two major characters (Amanda and Prince Michael) get married in a ceremony attended by nearly the entire main cast in the country of Moldavia (an archaic name for Moldova). However, a group of terrorists crash the ceremony and spray the entire audience and newlyweds with bullets, with the final image of the season being everyone lying on the ground motionless. This cliffhanger was done ostensibly so the producers had an out if any cast members wanted to leave. When the show, returned, however, it was revealed that only two minor characters had died. This is often cited as the reason for the show's ratings decline, as it slid from first to seventh place after the conclusion to the cliffhanger was revealed.

The second season opens with D'Argo jolting awake and John explaining that Aeryn was eventually able to scoop them up and drop them to safety at their current location. Part of the issue is that "Mind The Baby" was actually meant to be the <em>second</em> episode of the season. After filming the original premiere, which involved the rest of Moya's crew on a side-journey to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">a planet full of lawyers</a>, the producers felt it wasn't strong enough to justify making the audience wait an extra week for the resolution of the cliffhanger. The original episode was shuffled to later in the season (and framed as a flashback) which left John and D'Argo's rescue feeling rather abrupt and anti-climactic.

A series of Cliffhanger events were made at the end of one season. The first episode of the next season had one of the characters, Richard, narrate that at the end of each season when a series might get cancelled, the characters are usually put on cliffhangers as a means to ensure that the series has closure, but if the series continues, it results in the authors being written into a corner as they make lame excuses. Richard then enumerates the lame excuses for the last season's cliffhanger.

Sometime during the summer, though, it was decided to retool the show, and instead of season 2 picking up off where the first had ended, it opened with a regular episode, with only scant allusions to a resolution to the previous events—Sammo asking if someone who's trying to kill him with a bomb is seeking vengeance for Lee Hei's death, and a fellow officer asking Sammo, "Hey, you fell out of a helicopter into the Pacific and survived... how much worse could a bomb be?"

In the beginning of the second season, it's revealed that they got away by...running through a forest and maneuvering around a moving train, which stops the cops from chasing them. It's made worse by the fact that the first season ends at night, but the second season begins during the day, raising the question of what, exactly, happened in what must have been several hours between the episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> had several episodes ending in cliffhangers, and resolved the majority of them with Cliffhanger Copouts:
<ul><li> The first series' third episode ends with Lister triumphantly saying he passed the chef's exam, and thus now outranks Rimmer. The next episode reveals in Holly's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningNarration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningNarration">Opening Narration</a> that he was lying.

This was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">briefly explained</a> in the Series III premiere as part of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningScroll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningScroll">Opening Scroll</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreadablyFastText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreadablyFastText">Unreadably Fast Text</a>, which also resolved the foreshadowing from the first series' second episode that Lister will eventually have twin sons.
<ul><li> The writers did intend to spend the Series III premiere resolving that cliffhanger, but found that they couldn't make it funny enough and decided to just skip ahead. They also took the opportunity to explain away Kryten joining the cast and Holly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">changing appearance</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Series VI ended with the entire crew aboard Starbug as it was destroyed by their future selves.

Given that the ship is intact and all the main characters are present and/or accounted for (though not alive in the once again holographic Rimmer's case), it's ambiguous whether <em>Back to Earth</em> even follows the cliffhanger or if it follows an alternate ending.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1568v');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1568v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1568v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"Only the Good..." had an alternate ending which can be seen on the DVD's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedScene">Deleted Scenes</a> in which the crew manage to find an antidote to the virus and clearly survive</span>

Meanwhile, Dangle and Garcia are trapped in a car during a snowstorm, and the pre-credits teaser shows two firefighters opening up the car, only to react in horror while one says "Oh my god."
<ul><li> Season 4 premier: It was just a wrong number, and Wiegel's boyfriend is immediately killed.

We cut away just before hearing his gun go off. The next scene is a flash forward in which Scully has apparently been called to his apartment to identify the body of a white male who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. She identifies it as Mulder. The next season begins by revealing that Scully was lying, the body is not Mulder's, and the whole crying holding his gun thing was <em>not related to anything</em>. Made even worse that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisCarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisCarter">Chris Carter</a> lied to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GillianAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GillianAnderson">Gillian Anderson</a> when instructing her how to play that final scene, telling her that Mulder was alive, but Scully genuinely thought he was dead. Since Anderson is a great actress but Scully isn't, her tearful and quite moving statement about Mulder's death feels very cheap in retrospect.

<ul><li> Several episodes of Raw in 2012 built towards a storyline involving Zack Ryder, John Cena, Kane and Eve Torres. Kane was trying to get Cena to "embrace the hate" and did so by targeting his friend Zack and Eve who was Zack's girlfriend. One development of this had Eve being held prisoner in an ambulance so Cena could save her. She kissed him in the heat of the moment...conveniently enough for Zack to walk by and see. Afterwards she tearfully broke it off with him, claiming they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends">Just Friends</a>. The entire scenario screamed Kane manipulating Eve to mess with Cena and Zack. But the next week...
<ul><li> Eve out of nowhere claimed that she had been using Zack all along to further her career and was intending to do the same with Cena. Kane disappeared from the storyline completely. Fan theories state that Kane being behind the whole thing was the original idea...but the live crowds gave Eve an insane amount of heat for kissing Cena. So the writers likely saw potential and decided to turn her heel instead.

He then throws him and Sonic into a volcano, with Tails saying something like "I can't untie my tails!!" After the break, Tails unties his tails and they both escape.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloneHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloneHigh">Clone High</a></em>. Abe is launched out a high window by a bean-can explosion and sad music plays while he plummets. The scene pauses just as he is about to hit the ground with his face. When they come back, Abe is seen hovering just over a pool, where he falls in harmlessly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DangerMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DangerMouse">Danger Mouse</a></em>, whose stories were serialized in seasons two through four, had a rather egregious one in "The Duel". The end of episode three had DM and Penfold in a room with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWallsAreClosingIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWallsAreClosingIn">the walls closing in on them</a>. When episode four commences, Penfold just happens to have a large spanner that DM gave him for Christmas. DM uses it to stop the walls.
</li><li> In the 1980s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyAndFriends">My Little Pony 'n Friends</a></em> series, the cliffhangers in all multi-part stories were invariably resolved about 10 seconds into the next part - often while showing the short recap and having a character doing something they had not previously been doing (such as escaping being bound) or standing in different positions. Frequently, any cosmetic changes to characters (such as being covered in gunge or wearing different than usual clothes or their hair being styled differently than normal) were not carried over into the next episode, as each episode was seemingly produced by a different group of animators.
<ul><li> For instance, the cliffhanger for the third part of "Bright Lights" had Zeb, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> to that weeks villain, preparing to take Mollys shadow with Lofty unable to help her. However, at the start of the fourth part, Zeb wastes so much time that Lofty is able to break free of her restraints and save Molly, escaping before Zeb can take either of their shadows.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em>. After Season 2 ended with Rick put into an intergalactic prison, Season 3 starts with him at a Shoney's, saying "And that's how I escaped from space prison!" to his family. However, he then asks Jerry to fold himself 12 times, which he does. It then turns out that Rick hasn't actually escaped yet, and he's been placed in a simulation based on his memories. Then played straight at the end of the episode, when the reason he was arrested is retconned to be part of his greater plan.
</li><li> This is very common in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle">Rocky and Bullwinkle</a></em>, as the animation has little continuity within the same episode, much less between them. One specific example: an episode of the Upsidaisium arc ended with Bullwinkle holding a chunk of Upsidaisium and floating off into the sky. In the next episode, Rocky suggests Bullwinkle use his pick to break bits off of the chunk until he descends slowly, and he lands safely. In the previous episode, Bullwinkle was not holding a pick.
<ul><li> This also rather blatantly occurred during the Wossamatta U arc. One episode ends with Bullwinkle (playing for the eponymous college's football team) a mere foot away from inadvertently scoring the winning goal for the opposing team after chasing a disguised Boris without thinking about where he was going, after which the entire opposing team tackles the confused Bullwinkle before he can do anything as the game ends seconds later. The next episode opens by revealing that Boris had slipped away to the other end of the stadium behind the other goal (though, granted, this was at least foreshadowed), and Bullwinkle, looking for something to throw at Boris, decided to throw the football he was carrying at Boris before Hard Knox's team tackled him, with Rocky intercepting it and winning Wossamatta the game just in time.

</li><li> In the episode "Day of the Machines", a robot grappling with Optimus Prime slaps a control circuit card on him that puts him under the control of a Decepticon-hijacked supercomputer, which gloats about its victory over the Autobot leader as the scene goes to commercial. Upon returning to commercial, the computer has a couple more seconds to gloat before Optimus reveals he'd swapped out the control card the drone was wielding, with an inert one. Despite the fact that <em>no opportunity for such an action</em> had been visible during the prior struggle.
