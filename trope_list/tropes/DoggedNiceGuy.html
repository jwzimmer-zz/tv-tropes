</div></div><p>This is when Bob is madly in love with Alice. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLoveIsUnrequited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLoveIsUnrequited">Alice doesn't seem too interested</a>, so Bob keeps trying, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinksLikeARomanceNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinksLikeARomanceNovel">hoping that she will change her mind</a>.
</p><p>This can play out in one of two ways:
</p><p></p><ul><li> <strong>Spectacular Displays</strong>: If Bob and Alice are strangers or distant acquaintances when he falls for her, after the first confession that was turned down, he will show his affection in more and more spectacular ways to prove his serious intentions. Sometimes, the people around them will expect that Bob will eventually get together with Alice. Once Bob's displays of affection convince Alice to change her mind about him and give him a chance, the two will be portrayed as a normal couple. This is frequently used by romantic comedies or other shows/movies where they want to keep the audience asking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a>
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><li> <strong>Low-Key Yearning</strong>: If Bob and Alice are either long-time friends or strangers who just got into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends">Just Friends</a> relationship, Bob will take a more low-key route. Bob will likely begin by saying that he has his hopes for a more serious relationship, and he hopes Alice will eventually feel the same. He's content to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicLifePartners">Platonic Life-Partners</a> until that time comes. From here, he may remind her of his unrequited love every time he sees her, or he may never mention it again. Alice might refuse the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade">Relationship Upgrade</a> because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDontWantToRuinOurFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDontWantToRuinOurFriendship">she doesn't want to ruin this friendship</a>, or else believe that Bob just has a schoolboy crush he'll get over. If Alice is in a relationship, Bob might <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy">try to accept it for Alice's sake</a>. If Bob dates someone else in the interim, this may make Alice have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedEpiphany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedEpiphany">Green-Eyed Epiphany</a> and create an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrequitedLoveSwitcheroo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrequitedLoveSwitcheroo">Unrequited Love Switcheroo</a>.
</li></ul><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In traditional straight examples, as long as Bob is honestly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a>, or at least a decent guy, both of these two attitudes are usually expected to result in success. Due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfRomantic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfRomantic">Rule of Romantic</a>, Alice will always realize over time that she really happens to love him back.
</p><p>In some recent works, a more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism">cynical</a> take on the trope might be used to point out some ways this type of thinking could backfire, resulting in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedCharacterArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedCharacterArchetype">Deconstructed Character Archetype</a>. Spectacular displays might irritate the object of their affection by treating them like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">video game sidequest</a>, where more gifts and displays of affection will equal more attraction. It can also have implications of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> situation if Alice truly dislikes or fears Bob. The low-key yearning sort might be portrayed either as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a>, for whom the whole long-term friendship is just a means to an end, or tragically mistaken for not recognizing that Alice still only feels like they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">Like Brother and Sister</a> and reacts with extreme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squick</a> to romantic gestures. Both types might be examined to show that Bob actually feels that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledToHaveYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledToHaveYou">Entitled to Have You</a> and thinks that, since he's a "nice guy" who is interested in Alice, Alice is morally obligated to date him; he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WantsAPrizeForBasicDecency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WantsAPrizeForBasicDecency">Wants a Prize for Basic Decency</a>. Both versions can also be depicted as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow">Loving a Shadow</a>, as in Bob is more in love with the idea of Alice as his perfect soulmate rather than the real deal.

</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderInverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderInverted">Gender Inverted</a> variations occur relatively often, typically with a natural-looking, down-to-earth <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlNextDoor">Girl Next Door</a> type who is determined to win over the male friend she secretly loves, hoping he will eventually learn to appreciate her wholesome charms (often contrasted to the flashier appeal of a high-maintenance, unworthy gold-digger). There's a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> in play here: a Dogged Nice Girl will often be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">portrayed more sympathetically</a> than the Dogged Nice Guy, even if she's pushy or an extreme doormat, probably because Dogged Nice Girls will be seen as <em>needing</em> a man to feel fully whole in life and therefore not getting the guy <em>they</em> want will be more "tragic". Alternatively, Dogged Nice Guys are more frequently portrayed less favorably than their female counterparts because of the traditional implications of a man pushing a relationship versus a woman persistently pursuing a relationship.
</p><p>This can also have a same-sex variation, usually with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> feel to the plot, but it's just as often to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, especially if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation">Incompatible Orientation</a> is in play.
</p><p>See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtravertedNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtravertedNerd">Extraverted Nerd</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends">Just Friends</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy">I Want My Beloved to Be Happy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessSuitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessSuitor">Hopeless Suitor</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrequitedTragicMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrequitedTragicMaiden">Unrequited Tragic Maiden</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticRunnerUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticRunnerUp">Romantic Runner-Up</a>. This heavily relies on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkFallacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkFallacy">Hard Work Fallacy</a>.
</p><p>Compare with the less sympathetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadLove">Mad Love</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbhorrentAdmirer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbhorrentAdmirer">Abhorrent Admirer</a>.

In Chapter 469, Sakura gave him her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">infamous</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseConfession">fake love confession</a>, which she tried to pull off in the hopes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakHisHeartToSaveHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakHisHeartToSaveHim">he would stop trying to save Sasuke for her</a>. Naruto easily saw right through her, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">called her out for lying</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking">rejected her outright</a> by telling her that he <strong>hates</strong> people who lie to themselves, and told her that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePromise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePromise">The Promise</a> he made to her in Part I was no longer the reason why he's still trying to save Sasuke; he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">his own reasons</a> now.

As it turns out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">Naruto had been lying to himself about his own feelings for Sakura</a>, because he never actually cared for her as anything more than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">a close friend or older sister</a>. Once he finally moved on from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow">his one-sided shallow crush on her</a>, he eventually fell in love with and got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueLove">Hinata</a></span>.

<ul><li> Two moments question Shampoo's feelings for Mousse in the anime. The second movie she's arguing against her captor that she has no feelings for Mousse then rescues him anyway. And in one OVA she's given the reverse necklace which reverses her feelings; Mousse finally thinks it's his chance since she'll love him now only for her to scream how much she hates him and beat him nearly to death.

(Granted, he spent most of those five years concealing his feelings because of the homophobia thing, but he's had enough of hiding them by the fifth year.) Souichi even compares Morinaga's behavior towards him to a dog following its owner, though he's showing signs that he actually doesn't mind Morinaga's dogged pursuit of him.
<ul><li> Morinaga is an unusual example of this trope because he actually <em>rapes</em> Souichi (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstEpisodeTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstEpisodeTwist">at the beginning of the story, setting off the plot</a>). Normally this would disqualify him from DNG-hood, but his behavior afterward still counts as this trope, only now he's become more of The Conquerer as opposed to the Patient Friend.

As the movie progresses, however, they start to get along better, reaching a head when Marlena attacks one of the parasites that was trying to drag Hud away, getting bitten in the process. She starts to warm up to him when he helps treat her wound, but it all ends badly when the bite makes Marlena die in an incredibly disturbing and sudden way. It's driven home and made all the more wrenching that she asked Hud for help first when she starts rapidly worsening, rather than her best friend.</span>

He acts exactly like a romantic comedy protagonist, as this trope demands, but, of course, there are a few problems. Not least of all is the fact that, well, Shoshanna's (secretly) Jewish, she's already dating a black man Marcel, and he's a freakin' <em>Nazi</em>! To squick us out even more, he hero-worships the man who slaughtered her family; both the audience and Shoshanna know this from the second scene we see him in. When she finally manages to get through to him that there's no way in hell that she'll ever be interested in him, he stops being so nice... Also, he uses his strong-arm Nazi position to force her on dates with him and to position himself at the theater she works in. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledToHaveYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledToHaveYou">Very very not nice</a>.

He actually does get the girl—well, sort of. She likes him, but she'll only be with him if he can find a way to leave his hometown to be near her. His means of getting himself to her are creepy and occasionally manipulative of others, and the worst one has nothing to do with his Bad Boy alter-ego.

He makes a badly-timed comment about Anne's red hair and falls for her the instant she smashes her slate over his head in retribution. However, Anne holds this grudge for five years or so, in which time he tries valiantly to convince her he's not the jerk he originally came off as. Once they're friends, he gently implies at times that he wants to be more than just friends, though since Anne is oblivious to both his feelings for her and her growing feelings for him, it goes over her head.

<ul><li> Lydia flirts with Stiles in the fifth episode when he came by to see if she was okay - much to his delight, at least until he finds out that she's only doing so because she was really drugged up and thought he was Jackson.

While in the film he's a genuine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a>, the tv version never actually tells Bianca he's interested in her (he tries once in French, which he knows she doesn't understand and sends her a note he knows she never received). When she assumes he's gay, he makes only a cursory attempt to deny it. In one episode, she arranges to go to a dance with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">Jerk Jock</a>, and he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">sabotages the guy's car</a> and steals his cell phone to make her think she has been stood up, then offers to go with her in his place.

Although he doesn't especially qualify for either major type of this trope: he doesn't sabotage her relationships, but he was also pretty clear about liking her, whilst not being over the top in trying to woo her. As they grew up, Freddie and Carly went from being next-door buddies to true best friends.

</li><li> Both incarnations of the reality show <em>Average Joe</em> featured entire casts of Dogged Nice Guys — ugly and/or morbidly obese men vying for the affections of a stunning supermodel. At one point, the producers send a boatload of chiseled hunks to compete with the Joes, who instantly feel slighted by the new competition. This highlights the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> and enormous sense of entitlement inherent in this trope, as the Joes begin lashing out at the supermodel for turning her attention to the hunks, calling her shallow...never mind that the Joes <em>themselves</em> only went on the show for the chance to get with a <em>supermodel</em> and that, at the end of the day, they are no kinder or more intelligent than the attractive men.

This is a mild subversion, as it was pretty clear that she liked him, too. When they got together, the writers shifted this trait onto Marcus Little, toward London Tipton, who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">too much in her own world</a> to notice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ed">Ed</a></em> played this straight. The titular character's behavior would have gotten him a restraining order within the first episode in real life.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>, This kind of quest is the main story arc for Ted Mosby. The series starts with him being convinced he'll marry a girl he's just met, before even talking to her. Even though his borderline stalker attempts to win her affection (such as staging multiple romantic gestures like getting a romantic band into her apartment when she's not there) don't really work, Ted patiently waits for Robin to come around. After all, he tells his kids they have to learn "how to turn a no into a yes". More than once the audience is compelled to blame Robin for either "leading him on" or not succumbing to his attempts. When Robin gets engaged to his best friend, who treats her much better, Ted is bitter because according to him he is a better person than Barney. What follows is a disastrous series finale that shows him getting the initial target girl <em>25 years later</em> and had been written prior to the second season.
<ul><li> Encapsulated in Return of the Shirt. Ted decides that he wants to get back together with an old flame, Natalie, conveniently forgetting how he hurt her in their breakup. He finds her address and shows up uninvited, refusing to leave even when she slams the door in his face and eventually browbeats her into giving him another chance. Within a week, he's decided he doesn't like her anymore and breaks up with her...on her birthday...again. While he gets (comically) beaten up for dumping her, the show displays no concern about how he harassed her into accepting.
</li><li> Subverted in season 3 with Stella, where Stella has just as big a crush on Ted as he does on her, but she's a single mother and a doctor with practically no free time and doesn't think she has any time for dating. His solution is priceless.

By contrast, Stark, after his lover Zhaan dies, acts this way toward Aeryn as well in a quite creepy way, hanging around her shyly and occasionally making ham-fisted attempts to hit on her.

The local panic gave him a pretext to bond with the object of his affections over their shared need to protect the neighborhood, when she otherwise barely noticed him and gave no hint of returning his feelings. Eventually, he escalated to attacking <em>her</em> (and then pretending to save her!) when he found out she was seeing someone else.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrooklynNineNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrooklynNineNine">Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a></em> initially plays this fairly straight, but eventually deconstructs and subverts it. Detective Charles Boyle is initially hopelessly infatuated with Detective Rosa Diaz, which she makes clear on several occasions is a one-way relationship. This leads him to act in this fashion around her, but it eventually becomes clear that this is actually a bit creepy and weird of him and prompts those around him to view him with a certain degree of disdain. To his credit, however, he eventually realises that Diaz doesn't return his feelings, meets someone who does, and enters into a relationship with her instead. This in turn leads him to start acting more appropriately around Diaz, and he eventually apologises to her for his behaviour and acknowledges that he "wasn't much fun to be around". While the later relationship also ended, there's been no indication that Boyle has renewed his earlier interest in or pursuit of Diaz. There are also some hints that Boyle's behaviour might have had something to do with a recent divorce.

Lucas is a bright reporter with lots of promise and a good reputation. Then he meets Zoe Barnes and falls in love. He asked her out twice, but she blows him off both times. Meanwhile, she is having a sexual relationship with Frank Underwood, an ambitious political figure scheming to become President. Because she is also ambitious, she believes she can use him to expand her career. Once Frank is done using her, she gives Lucas a chance, but only because by then, she suspects Underwood might have committed murder and is using Lucas to help investigate. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This leads to Frank Underwood killing her, leaving lovesick Goodwin devastated.

The main character, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoExGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoExGirlfriend">despite the show's title</a>, is more of a Dogged Nice Girl determined to win back over the boy she'd dated once at summer camp when they were both 16, but as the show goes on it becomes pretty clear that she isn't the lovable, plucky heroine, but a self-centered borderline stalker. She's contrasted with some male examples as well - Trent is <em>slightly</em> less stable than her but as a man, his own obsession with Rebecca feels substantially less cutesy (though a side character does encourage him once, telling him that while forcing friendship never works, forcing romance is the stuff of fairy tales, citing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cinderella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cinderella">Cinderella</a></em>). Then there's Greg, the most straightforward example, who falls for Rebecca from the beginning despite her total lack of interest in him. Though he's initially treated by the story as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> who Rebecca will realize was there with her all along, by the end of the first season it becomes clear that he has enough issues of his own, and falling in love with a girl who was actively kind of a jerk to him is one of them. Their relationship was just never balanced and was bad for them both, so in Season 2, he leaves the show entirely. In the end, forcing love really doesn't ever work, either - the relationships that do work (like Darryl and White Josh) were basically mutual from the beginning.

Coach eventually snaps at the girls for taking advantage of Winston and tells him to stop helping them. While the girls initially deny leading him on, when they realize Winston is going to leave in the middle of the renovation, they reconsider. End result: One of the girls has sex with Winston, Winston finishes the renovation, and then no one talks about it ever again because they all agree it was embarrassing for everyone.
</li><li> Joe of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/You2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/You2018">You</a></em> is an especially harsh deconstruction of this character type.

For the most part, Lois was oblivious to it, until the second season episode "Robbery", when Craig confesses his feelings to her while they are being held hostage at gunpoint during a robbery of the drugstore they work in. After he confesses his feelings, Lois <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">brutally</a> explains to him that there's nothing between them and there never will be. It's so harsh, even one of the robbers expresses some pity for Craig. He's a crying wreck by the end of the episode, but this does spur him to get over his unrequited crush, and in later episodes, even begins dating other women with varying degrees of success.

He has a deep crush on Carli, his neighbor and childhood best friend, and will do anything to win her over.

Over the course of the series it becomes clear that she's just stringing him along to manipulate him when it's convenient for her, and his pursuit makes him pathetic rather than successful.

In-series, Jenny never returns his affections, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">though she gets very close several times</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan">The Spectacular Spider Man</a>.</em> Peter Parker plays this role when trying to get Daily Bugle secretary Betty Brant to be his date to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchoolDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchoolDance">High-School Dance</a>. He is thwarted in his efforts by his Aunt May, who frankly tells Betty that, at twenty to his sixteen, she's too old to be dating Peter. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikesOlderWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikesOlderWomen">Much to Peter's chagrin</a>, Betty takes this to heart and turns Peter down.
</li><li> The titular character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em> becomes a mild version of this after he realizes that he <em>likes</em> likes Lila.
</li><li> Cody on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em> is this to Gwen, although he eventually decides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy">I Want My Beloved to Be Happy</a> when she hooks up with his friend Trent. In the third season, he returns to the game and continues chasing Gwen (who has since broken up with Trent)... but when she hooks up with Duncan, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass">Cody punches Duncan in the face instead, and becomes more creepily obsessed with Gwen.</a>
<ul><li> Cody himself is on the receiving end of this treatment from Sierra, who is also something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan">Loony Fan</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddparents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddparents">The Fairly Oddparents</a></em> has Timmy to Trixie and Mark to Vicky. So far, no luck for either of them.
<ul><li> Tootie to Timmy in a female example, though it can drift into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has it that she will be successful in the live-action adaptation.
</li></ul></li><li> Jervis Tetch (aka the Mad Hatter) from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em> starts out as this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfICantHaveYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfICantHaveYou">Things go quickly downhill</a> when he takes advantage of a temporary breakup to try courting Alice himself, only for her boyfriend to come back into the picture with an engagement.
</li><li> Bolin in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>. He's supportive of and nice to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Korra</a> from the moment he meets her, but she's interested in his standoffish brother Mako, who becomes more cordial with her as he gets to know her.
<ul><li> What raises Bolin to actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> status is that he accepts Korra's choice and respects her feelings and goes on to be friends with her. By the end of the show Bolin has gone on to have serious relationships with three other women... while Mako gets bounced from Korra to Asami and then spends the remainder of the show single.
</li></ul></li><li> Mordecai of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow">Regular Show</a></em> started off as this to Margaret, who seemed to have new boyfriends every time she met him, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> until it was deconstructed to nothing in season 3</span>.
</li><li> Braco from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> is like this towards PB, despite her constant detests. He ends up digging his own grave with his actions, eventually making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a> and becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Humanoid Abomination</a>. PB ends up creating a robot lookalike for him, which at first he is uncomfortable with, but the moment it shows physical attraction toward him, he has a change of heart.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> Spike is this to Rarity. Whether she feels the same, just considers it a cute crush, or is even <em>aware</em> seems to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">change with each episode</a>. Ultimately, nothing came of it, as by the time of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, Spike appears to have let his crush go and dedicated himself to being Twilight's adviser and official Friendship Ambassador to the dragon lands, while Rarity is managing a fashion franchise all around Equestria.
</li><li> Zephyr Breeze, Fluttershy's brother, is this to Rainbow Dash, constantly flirting with her and seemingly oblivious to the fact that she can't stand him. While he returns for a quick cameo where Dash has to distract him by pretending to return his feelings, ultimately nothing comes of this either. Zephyr isn't seen again outside of background appearances, and it is all but explicitly stated that Rainbow (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod">maybe?</a>) ends up together with Applejack.
</li></ul></li><li> Gideon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstruction</a> of this trope. He is devoted to Mabel but she just wants to be friends, and in-universe everyone seems to think that his attempts to win her over are charming...but the truth is, Gideon is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledBastard">Entitled Bastard</a> who uses emotional manipulation to trap Mabel into a relationship. He performs over-the-top acts of kindness, manipulates her into going into more dates with him by asking her very publicly in front of large crowds of Gravity Falls citizens who think it's just <em>so adorable</em> that Gideon might finally get a girlfriend and completely ignores her wish to not be in a relationship with him. Eventually, Dipper tries to break the news that Mabel is not interested in Gideon to him, and Gideon responds to this by attempting to <em>murder</em> Dipper because he believes that Dipper got in between him and Mabel. Thankfully, Mabel sees this and intervenes, and she rejects him, not only romantically, but as a friend now, too.
<div class="indent"><strong>Mabel</strong>: <em>(after rejecting Gideon again)</em> But we can still be makeover buddies, right? Wouldn't you like that? <br/><strong>Gideon</strong>: Really? <br/><strong>Mabel</strong>: <em>(rips amulet away from Gideon)</em> No, not really! You are, like, attacking my brother! What the heck?!
</div></li><li> Bashful from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/The7D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/The7D">The 7D</a></em>. He's a mild-mannered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Shrinking Violet</a> with an unrequited crush on Queen Delightful, but he's too scared to admit his affections for her. He's also clingy around the Queen. In "Buckets", he offers to stay with Queen Delightful while passive-aggressively sending Lord Starchbottom off with the other dwarfs (although while they were gone, they didn't do anything except talk about who "Buckets" is). In "The Jollywood Games", he enters and wins a tournament in the hope that he can get a kiss from her (and he does, eventually, after she rejects his request). In "Free Teensy", he appears from behind her and she reacts with a stunned "Oh. Hello." He then declares, "She can't get enough of me."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug">Miraculous Ladybug</a></em> Chat Noir continues to pine after the titular heroine even after being rejected twice, much to her annoyance.
