<p>Alice is planning something that will hurt Bob in some way. Even though she feels bad about it, she's decided to keep this a secret from Bob. It is therefore almost guaranteed that even though Bob doesn't know what Alice is up to, he will say things that make Alice feel even worse, talking about how much he trusts her, or the importance of not keeping secrets from each other, or just what a wonderful person Alice is.

Sometimes she'll simply put up with it and go through with her plan anyway. Sometimes, she'll <em>want</em> to stop, but has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">already put things irrevocably in motion</a> or simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IveComeTooFar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IveComeTooFar">gone too far to reverse course</a>. Often, the added pressure leads to a breakdown and a confession.

</p><p>Most of the time, the audience is aware of the deception or secret, making this a subtrope of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony">Dramatic Irony</a>, as the audience cringes on behalf of the character, who is most likely already in an unpleasant situation, and now has to feel worse about it.

Usually an aspect of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnowballLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnowballLie">Snowball Lie</a>.

She saves him from being badly cut by broken dishes, injuring herself in the process. Kurama planned on leaving at some point after that, but couldn't bring himself to do so, and eventually came to love her enough to be willing to give his life to save hers.

He's always ready to step in and defend his son when L accuses Light of being Kira, and talks about how proud he is of the mature and honest man Light has grown into. Initially, Light just ignores his father's behavior, but in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the chapters leading up to Sōichirō's death</span> he seems increasingly affected by it.

</li><li> In Episode 6 of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AccelWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AccelWorld">Accel World</a></em> anime, Haru spends 300 points to level up, leaving him with only eight points left; if he loses even once, he'll lose Brain Burst forever. Because of that, he keeps it secret from Kuroyukihime when he meets with her, and when they discuss their future plans, he acts as though he hasn't leveled up yet. Kuroyukihime warns him not to level up without enough points in reserve and tells him that he won't be stupid enough to make that mistake, unaware that he already did.

Biko reminds Rio of something Rio once said- that you can keep going through hard times if you have someone close to you- and then asks if she can be that person for Rio now that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rio's mother is dead</span>.

Luke is <em>overjoyed</em> at the prospect of his teacher surviving, and openly so. This guilts the actor severely, and Luke pulls him into situations where to deflect suspicion he <em>has</em> to do what Obi-Wan would... and in the end he has a literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObiWanMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObiWanMoment">Obi-Wan Moment</a> and calmly dies to save Luke.
