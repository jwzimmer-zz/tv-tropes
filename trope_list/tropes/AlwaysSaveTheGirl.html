<ul><li> Belldandy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a></em> makes it clear she puts Keiichi's life ahead of all others, once allowing the cutting of the Universal superstring rather than killing him when he is possessed by the Lord of Terror, ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">taking the third option</a> to save the day.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AnatoliaStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AnatoliaStory">Anatolia Story</a></em> gives an interesting justification for this trope. Kail goes to all sorts of trouble to keep Yuri safe and while he does care about her well-being, he has a more personal reason to be invested in her staying alive — his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother">Wicked Stepmother</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">Nakia</a> magically summoned Yuri to Anatolia for the purpose of ritualistically killing her to curse Kail and his brothers to die, so her own son could take the throne. If Nakia succeeds in killing Yuri, Kail's a goner. The trope is played with more further into the manga, as Yuri is in danger of threats besides Nakia. Kail occasionally has to remember that he has a duty to the entire empire and must keep that in mind even if Yuri's in danger (for her part, Yuri's usually fine with Kail acting for the greater good of the people). He nearly plays the trope straight in one instance, where Yuri is framed for the murder of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his older brother, who had been king,</span> and Nakia tries to use this as a justification to have her executed. Kail nearly goes against all sense and begins to head off to the city-state she's hiding in, only to be stopped when Ilbani threatens to commit suicide, on the grounds that he dedicated his entire life to helping Kail become king and care for the empire. Kail going to help Yuri and thus committing treason would throw away all hope for that dream being realized and thus give Ilbani no reason to live. This shocks Kail enough to stop.

She was willing to take on the entire military to protect him, and when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ymir supposedly joins the Titans trying to kidnap Eren, and Krista tries to protect her, Mikasa was willing to cut through Ymir and Krista if it would save Eren</span>. She gets called out on this sometimes, most notably by Jean.
</li><li> It is noted by others, such as Reiner, that Ymir cares a lot more about Krista's safety than that of humanity's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and Reiner tries to use this fact to in his attempt to recruit Ymir for their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAllHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAllHumans">Kill All Humans</a> plan</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>: Guts only cares about one thing aside from slicing monsters apart and that is former love of his life and former Hawks Captain Casca. While their first meeting was hostile, after Casca grudgingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntimateHealing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntimateHealing">keeps his body</a> warm with her own, Guts forms strong feelings for her. He was more than ready to fall off a cliff with her and had no qualms blocking arrows shot at her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">with his body</a>, it's these acts that ultimately cause Casca to fall for him, as she claimed no man had ever shed blood for her in battle before. Guts goes above and beyond protecting her, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">brutally</a> defending her from violating monsters and going near when he couldn't save her from Griffith in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mordor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mordor">Eclipse</a> Guts becomes borderline insane.
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueArc">Conviction Arc</a>. Guts saves the now insane Casca from being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch">burned at the stake as a witch</a> by Bishop Mozgus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician">and his henchmen</a>, who are being backed by all of the citizens <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GullibleLemmings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GullibleLemmings">who blindly follow whatever he says just to save themselves from damnation</a>. They want to burn her because they think she is responsible for the influx of monsters and evil spirits around St. Albion (and technically they're correct, since the Brand of Sacrifice on Casca's breast attracts evil spirits that are nearby that want to eat her)</span>. Guts doesn't really give a damn about what will happen to the innocents caught up in the attack <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">so long as he and Casca survive at the end of it all</a>, and indeed is disgusted that all that these people are even doing is praying and clinging to Mozgus's every word instead of trying to get the hell out of Dodge. He tells Mozgus and the refugees to suck it up and deal with it.
</li><li> After this, Guts has begun amassing new teammates and friends along on his journey, and although he cares for them all, Casca still remains on a completely different level. He clearly puts her well-being ahead of his other comrades (as this was a big reason why he tried to convince one of his teammates to stay with the group since she served as Casca's caretaker) and Guts is fully prepared to drop everything at a pin drop if there is even the <em>slightest</em> chance that Casca will be cured of her insanity.

<ul><li> Accelerator doesn't care if you're an angel, an esper, or the entire world's military forces combined; he won't let <em>anything</em> happen to Last Order.
</li><li> There's also Touma, who will help anyone in need. Usually this help involves punching someone in the face. While everything around him is exploding. During one arc, several factions are trying to capture, rescue, or kill Orsola Aquinas due to her supposed knowledge of The Book Of Law. When Touma rescues her, she is surprised and charmed to find that he didn't care about the knowledge at all. He was the only person who cared about <em>her</em>.

<ul><li> At the end of season 1, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lelouch drops everything in the middle of the key battle and goes off to save his sister Nunnaly</span>, and again in season 2 when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lelouch does the same thing when Kallen is captured,</span> and this time someone even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> how it reeks of preferential treatment, and how absurd it is to choose one life over an entire country. Doesn't stop him from doing it anyway. However, <em>Code Geass</em> is somewhat of a subversion of the trope, since while Lelouch does choose the girl over everything else, in both cases <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it backfires, causing him to suffer defeat, and lose the girl anyway</span>.
</li><li> In a non-hostage example, Ohgi secretly goes AWOL from the Black Knights to see Villetta, who he knows is going to kill him.

The team of Exorcists sent to find him end up battling Tyki on the Ark. Cross is sneaking around behind the scenes, and is aware of the younger Exorcists fighting down below. He goes to save everyone. He claims he saved Allen because he needed him. Later, while the ark crumbles, Cross holds Lenalee close while trying to halt the download process of the Akuma Egg. Then later, while flirting with Lenalee, he goes on to say he'd have come to help everyone sooner if he'd known she was with them.

<ul><li><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac">Sanji</a> is the living embodiment of this trope. A good example is seen in the Foxy filler; Sanji nearly gives up a game of a Red Light-Green Light by jumping after an enemy girl to rescue her. Sanji is still in the game by kicking his legs really fast so he floats perfectly still, but the game master can't see. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He loses when the girl kisses him. This was not be the last time Sanji would save a female from the villain team, during the chaos of the Tea Party in Whole Cake Island Arc, Sanji saved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdEye">Pudding</a> from the collapsing wedding cake despite her plot to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackWidow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackWidow">shoot him dead</a> at the altar.</span>
</li><li> Sanji is especially protective over the ship's navigator and fellow pirate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">Nami</a>. Her safety is a frequent cause of his own injuries, such as on Drum Island when Nami was gravely ill, and Sanji joined Luffy in taking her to the doctor's and got his spine cracked as a result of the avalanche caused by the Lapahns. In Skypeia when Sanji went aboard the Ark Maxim with Usopp to save her from Enel only to be blasted by the God for his heroics, and on Thiller Bark when Nami was kidnapped by the invisible Absalom to become his bride, Sanji went alone to rescue her and defend her honor and got knifed though his shoulder while protecting her.
</li><li> Luffy also strongly prioritizes helping his friends over the rest of the world. The most obvious example is when he released half the inmates of Impel Down in his quest to save his brother. The prisoners served as a cannon fodder and most of them were shot, bludgeoned or poisoned to the death before they subjected themselves under Buggy. Luffy has yet to show any sort of guilt for the dozens of dangerous criminals that managed to escape alive.
</li><li> In fact, the first three rises of his bounty involved crises with the women of the crew. He first gained his bounty after defeating Arlong and liberating Nami from his control. Then, his defeat of Crocodile, an act that ultimately saved Vivi's country, would have his first rise. The next rise happened after he saved Robin from Enies Lobby, an event where he would also defeat several thousand mooks, and include the destruction of the entire island itself thanks to the inept chief of CP9 accidentally ordering a Buster Call, and the entire crew declaring war on the World Government (which basically amounts to the entire world). This would result in a staggering two hundred million beri increase. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His latest rise, while not involving a woman this time, still involves saving someone. While the rescue wasn't successful, his actions over the course that one week (which included punching out a world noble, one of the rulers of the world, and causing the first mass breakout of Impel Down, where only one person had ever escaped on their own before) caused a hundred million beri increase.</span>
</li><li> Robin says she cares more about the other Straw Hats than the entire rest of the world. This is more logical than many cases, given that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseYouWereNiceToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseYouWereNiceToMe">the Straw Hats are the first people she's met since the destruction of Ohara who haven't tried to use her, kill her or turn her over to the Marines</a>.

But the big exception to this mindset is Marine Captain and beautiful Swordswoman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSquadette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSquadette">Tashigi</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who just so happens to be identical to Zoro's dead childhood friend Kuina, small world huh?</span> Zoro was unable to fight her without a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">Freak Out</a> and opted (like Sanji for most evil ladies) to avoid her all together. This was made difficult as Tashigi assumed Zoro had gone easy on because she was a woman, humiliated Tashigi vowed to beat Zoro chasing him across Grand Line with her Superior Smoker. When they met again after two years, Zoro had got over her appearance and "seemed" indifferent towards Tashigi who still called him out on being sexist, saying that he was holding back when they were fighting the evil harpy Monet. Zoro tired her accusations sat out of the fight and watched while Tashigi struggled against the powerful foe, when she was about to die Zoro stepped in and saved her as he couldn't stand watching her suffer, slicing the harpy in half and letting Tashigi finish her off. Zoro even carried her out of the room on his shoulder (which is rare for him).
</li><li> This is the main reason why the second half of the Whole Cake Island arc played out the way it did. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The only reason the Straw Hats were present in time for the Tea Party is because Sanji was the unwilling groom the Big Mom Pirates kidnapped for it, and they were there to take him back, albeit discreetly. Sanji wanted to go with them the moment they finally had an opening, but as it turned out, the entire wedding was a sham to assassinate him and his biological family; despite justifiably hating said family, he was ultimately too compassionate to leave them to their fates and asked for the rest of the crew's help in saving them. Luffy and co. agreed, which led to them getting involved with Capone Bege's own assassination attempt on Big Mom — and when <em>that</em> failed, the entire situation escalated into a full-scale conflict that engulfed all of Totto Land. End result? Big Mom mindlessly rampaging all across the archipelago for over half a day, causing untold amounts of casualties and property damage, the destruction of dozens of her crew's ships, and the defeats of several thousands of her subordinates, up to and including her over all strongest underling in her second son, Charlotte Katakuri. And to top it off, the entire situation was witnessed by a high-ranking World Government agent and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> media baron. All of these events were so outrageous that the Straw Hats were declared an <em>Emperor-class crew</em> over them, even though ninety percent of what happened was completely unintentional on their end.</span>

This is shown to be a <em>very bad</em> attitude to have, since it leads to him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">slaughtering a village, and ultimately results in his death</span>. Especially since the people he was trying to rescue Clarke from hadn't actually taken her.
</li><li> And when Finn faces consequences for these actions, Raven is ready to do whatever it takes to protect him, even trying to get someone else punished for his crimes, or starting a war with their allies in a (probably futile) attempt to save him.

</li><li> Perhaps learning from the above examples, the <em>Twelfth</em> Doctor loves Clara Oswald so much that, similarly to River, he is willing to take extreme risks to keep her safe. She's willing to do the same for him (and others) as well.

I'm changing history to save Clara." For a series that spent a <em>half century</em> repeatedly reminding the audience  and the Doctor!  that changing history is dangerous, reckless and must not be done, this is a huge deal (and also an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">OOC Is Serious Business</a>).

They both then belatedly realize that for once, that's actually <em>true</em>; the ship only caters to the worst murderers, cannibals, and genocidal maniacs in the galaxy. Even getting on the crew requires proof of multiple murders. With their consciences clear, River and the Doctor just leave and let the ship crash.

<ul><li> This isn't even a thought for Mulder in terms of Scully; he seems to do it on pure instinct. Mulder is so predictable when his partner is taken, that the villains of the story exploit it. In the 1998 movie <em>Fight the Future</em>, one of Syndicate suggests that instead of killing Mulder, they must "Take away what he holds most valuable. That with which he can't live without." with the next scene showing Scully staring off into the horizon. True to form, Mulder doesn't hesitate to save her, even when it includes going to Antartica and breaking into a top-secret space craft.
</li><li> It works the other way around, too, in which Scully will risk everything to save Mulder. She doesn't even let being pregnant get in the way of heading her own private investigation into his abduction, which involves driving cross-country and confronting alien replacements. In fact, it is Skinner who tries to convince her that Mulder wouldn't want her to do this if he had known her condition.

However, it is consistently shown that he will discard all of that the moment any threat to the Flying Squirrel's safety presents itself. In "The Devil's Due", the Red Panda seriously considers killing villain of the week Nick Diablos when he repeatedly hypnotizes the Flying Squirrel to either attack him or torture her. By battle's end, he possibly does even worse than kill Diablos, as the Red Panda delivers unto Nick Diablos the fate he reserved for his own victims: a catatonic state in which he'll experience his greatest fears forever.
</li><li> In "The World Next Door", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline">Alternate Time</a> Traveler Baboon McSmoothie needs to steal the prototype of a device its Nazi scientist creator will eventually use to wreak havoc during World War II, and tries to recruit the Red Panda's aid in doing so. Even after the Red Panda is convinced of McSmoothie's story, he refuses to assist the commission of a crime against someone who, at that moment, is innocent of any wrongdoing and may never be guilty of such. It's then that McSmoothie reveals that <em>his</em> Red Panda expected this and prepared accordingly. That Red Panda had a sidekick called the Flying Squirrel, too. That Flying Squirrel was killed in a deathtrap meant for the other Red Panda, and McSmoothie offers the full case file on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeamUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeamUp">Villain Team-Up</a> that will launch the attack so that it might be prevented from happening to this universe's Flying Squirrel. The Red Panda accepts, even knowing that due to the vast differences between his timeline and McSmoothie's the case file may well be worthless.
</li><li> In "The Field Trip", that once innocent of any wrongdoing Nazi scientist Professor Friedrich von Schlitz has become a proper member of the Red Panda's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery">Rogues Gallery</a>, and shoots the Flying Squirrel in the process of getting away. The Flying Squirrel is fine, due to having protection against the type of weapon von Schlitz used, but the Red Panda doesn't let the matter go so easily, later noting that von Schlitz didn't know that and had every intention of killing one of them. The very next episode opens with an assassination attempt on von Schlitz orchestrated the Red Panda.
