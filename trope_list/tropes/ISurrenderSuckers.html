</p><p>Except, when the offer is accepted  <strong>surprise!</strong> They launch an attack when the opposition drops their guard. This move may let them completely blow away the opposition, or it may only provide enough confusion to allow a timely escape, depending on just how badly taken in the opposition was.
</p><p>One variation involves the one surrendering intentionally allowing himself to be captured in order to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonousCaptive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonousCaptive">undermine the enemy from within.</a> Often he must rely on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> to break him out of his prison, though sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayAlongPrisoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayAlongPrisoner">he can manage this on his own.</a>

In other words, if you don't honor your own surrender, not only does it ensure that the enemy <em>will</em> get you back good and hard next time, but others who are genuine in their intent to surrender may very well find <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurrenderBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurrenderBackfire">the enemy refusing to accept their pleas</a> out of paranoia (see the Real Life section for how justified such fears are).

<ul><li> Subverted with Matt from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>. Everyone knows who he is, and that's probably why. Except in the manga, where the point was that <em>nobody</em> there knows who he is... or really cares what he's done... or thinks he might try to escape. He's simply trying bluffing or reason (it's ambiguous) on the wrong people.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Lightnovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Lightnovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em> "Into the Blue" arc, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Gauron surrenders and intentionally allows himself to be captured as part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plan">plan</a> to infiltrate and take control of the <em>Tuatha De Danaan</em>. Notably, the <em>De Danaan</em>'s captain and crew are aware of the risk and take precautions, but even in spite of that Gauron manages to cause a whole lot of trouble with his ploy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">first anime</a>, the Lior plot has Ed willingly surrender to Cornello, knowing that Cornello was clueless enough to underestimate him and Al, leaving open many opportunities to escape and defeat the false prophet.
</li><li> Also in <em>Brotherhood</em>, the Ice-Alchemist surrenders to the military — and then he transmutes steam and escapes.
</li></ul></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kuradeel</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em> after Asuna kicks his ass, begging for mercy to buy enough time to disarm her.
</li><li> Taikoubou from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulHunter">Soul Hunter</a></em> does exactly this when fighting Oukijn. TWICE. In the <em>same battle</em>. The first time, he pretends to give up fighting, saying that she's too strong for him, and laments about how he should have been loyal to Dakki. He then requests that Oukijn allow him to do a wood fortune reading for Dakki's future, which turns out to be a trick so that he can set fire to her Hagoromo. The second time is when she tries to do the same trick to him, "surrendering" - to which he pretends to "accept", only to once again sucker-punch her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> Tao Pai Pai (Mercenary/General Tao) does this when he's losing his rematch against Goku—following up his "surrender" by throwing a grenade. Unfortunately for Tao, Goku deflects it right back at him...
</li><li> Raditz pulls this off at the very beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> (and, conversely, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallKai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallKai">Dragon Ball Kai</a></em> as well), when Goku gets a hold of his tail. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel">Since doing this weakens a Saiyan</a>, Raditz tries to convince Goku to let go by saying that, if he does, he'll leave Earth without causing any damage to it. Despite Piccolo's warning, Goku believes him... and just as soon as he lets Raditz go, he is struck in the stomach.
<ul><li> This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DragonBallZAbridged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DragonBallZAbridged">Dragon Ball Z Abridged</a></em> as Goku is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Frieza tries the same after losing to Goku. Goku gives him enough energy to get away from the soon-to-be-exploding planet (since he can survive in space), but Frieza uses it to attack as soon as Goku's back is turned. Subverted as this time Goku just turns around and blows him away.
</li><li> Even the Z-Fighters, or at least Piccolo, aren't innocent of this. When Cell managed to drain Piccolo's arm, Piccolo apparently seemed resigned to his fate of being absorbed by Cell and instead asks that Cell at least explain to him what he is, what his plans are, and how he came to be. Turns out, this was a gambit thought up by Piccolo (or rather, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">the Kami half of him</a>) to not only get Cell to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustBetweenYouAndMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustBetweenYouAndMe">tell him everything</a> but also buy enough time to recharge his Ki energy so he could remove his arm and regenerate without weakening himself even further.
</li><li> Eis Shenron pulled this off when defeated by Nova Shenron and Goku, successfully blinding Goku as well. Unfortunately, he didn't dull Goku's other senses.
</li></ul></li><li> Occurs in Neji and Hinata's backstory in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>; when they were small the Hidden Leaf Village was at war with the Hidden Cloud Village, who sent their head ninja to offer a treaty. It's revealed the next day that the treaty was just a ploy to kidnap Hinata for her Byakugan, but when her father kills the Cloud ninja in the act, the Cloud Village plays dumb and instead doubles down and demands Hinata's father's life as compensation.
</li><li> Number 96 uses this trick in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL">Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL</a></em>. It purposely lets the duelist using its card lose to Yuma so that Astral will absorb its card so that it can later take control of Astral. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Fortunately for all involved, the plan fails, and Astral reabsorbs Number 96, making it, in effect, a <em>real</em> prisoner.</span>
</li><li> Rokudo Mukuro from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Katekyō Hitman Reborn!</a></em> does this during his fight with Tsuna. He pretends that he has given up and been defeated, asking Tsuna to kill him. After Tsuna refuses and turns his back on him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBack">Mukuro attacks him</a>.
</li><li> Also done in one of the final episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DNAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DNAngel">D.N.Angel</a></em>, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dark surrenders himself to the army in the snow so he can get captured, <em>thus</em> getting closer to the painting.</span>.
</li><li> And in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FantasticChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FantasticChildren">Fantastic Children</a></em>; Tohma makes it look like he is allowing Dumas <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to go into the 'spirit world' to save Helga by simply walking away...then <em>punches him in the face to knock him unconscious</em> so that he (Tohma) can go instead</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilesGloriosus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilesGloriosus">Adon</a> finds himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWasBeatenByAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWasBeatenByAGirl">outclassed by Casca</a>, he immediately starts to show contrition and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">begs for his life</a>. When Casca lowers her guard—albeit not because she fell for it but out of sheer surprise and disgust—Adon shoots her with a poisoned crossbow bolt, a technique that has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">passed down in his Corbowitz family for over a thousand years!</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ali Al Saachez is cornered by Lyle in episode 24 and briefly releases his weapon. Being in zero gravity, it floats right next to him. When Lyle hesitates, Ali grabs the gun and spins around only to get nailed.</span> Nice try though.
</li><li> A couple of instances occur in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>
<ul><li> In the second season, <em>R</em>, after the Sailor Guardians, with exception of Usagi herself are abducted by Crimson Rubeus, she voluntarily surrendered herself, but it's to get onto to Rubeus's ship to go try to rescue her comrades.
</li><li> In the 5th Season, <em>Sailor Stars</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sailors Uranus and Neptune pretended to do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>, submitting to Galaxia's will and even <em>killing</em> Saturn and Pluto, and then, when the going got good and they did enough damage, made an attempt on her life. Subverted in that Galaxia is seemingly immortal, and both Sailor Senshi are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays">instantly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">destroyed</a> upon the revelation of her immortality.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OutlawStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OutlawStar">Outlaw Star</a>,</em> Suzuka fights a foe who prostrates himself before her...then opens fire with two automatic weapons. She calmly deflects every shot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl">Gunslinger Girl</a></em>: In a rather clever move, Henrietta pretends to be a little girl who is running away from "the scary men downstairs". The two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>, who had her pinned behind a corner, figure they can take her hostage.

<ul><li> Believe it or not, there is a way to do this in chess. When in a losing position, some unscrupulous players have been known to silently offer their opponent a handshake, a universally recognized symbol of resignation. The problem is that a handshake offer can also mean an offer of a draw. After the opponent accepts, the losing player would then claim they were not resigning, but offering a draw, and by shaking their hand their opponent had accepted. This trick is considered to be very poor sportsmanship, but it's not technically against the rules. Of course, an astute way to avoid it is to ask your opponent "are you resigning?" if they offer a handshake, before taking their hand.

</li><li> In Marvel Comics, Belasco pulls something like this a couple of times. Trying to kill a surrendered enemy puts a black mark on your soul that puts you in his power. Stopping when he surrenders lets him get you again. Being good enough to boot him elsewhere lacks something in the way of permanence. (Of course, given the nature of Limbo, killing him might too.)
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thunderbolts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thunderbolts">Thunderbolts</a></em> arc "Caged Angels" had four psychics intentionally surrender themselves to the Thunderbolts so that they could get locked up in Thunderbolts Mountain.

As the story begins they are charging a German pillbox, which quickly gets taken out with the help of a grenade. Two wounded German soldiers then emerge from the pillbox, staggering about aimlessly and holding up their arms. Sgt. Rock orders his men to take them captive, but just then someone opens fire and kills the two would-be prisoners in cold blood. Sarge angrily demands to know who fired, and is confronted with the same soldier who had hurled the grenade: Private "Johnny Doe", an orphaned child who had been drafted into the Army when he turned 18 and soon discovered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero">he had a talent for ruthlessly butchering Nazis</a>. Sarge accuses Johnny of murdering surrendering men, but Johnny points out that they never threw down their guns, so they didn't <em>officially</em> surrender. He further argues that the Germans could have just been faking surrender and that if he hadn't cut them down, they could have wiped out all of Easy Company. Sarge lets the matter drop after that, but things get worse as Johnny Doe grows bolder and bolder in his vigilantism.

White's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOnceAndFutureKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOnceAndFutureKing">The Once and Future King</a></em> has a comical jousting match between Sir Pellinore and Sir Grummore early in the novel. Grummore quickly knocks Pellinore from his horse and strikes his armored head repeatedly with his sword until Pellinore agrees to cry "<em>Pax</em>!" ("Peace!"); Pellinore finally realizes he's beaten and says "<em>Pax</em>"...but then quickly adds "<em>Non</em>!" ("Not!") under his breath and overpowers the unsuspecting Grummore. He soon has Grummore lying helplessly on his back and is trying to decide whether he should slay him. Grummore angrily orders Pellinore to kill him, since he refuses to live with the shame of having been bested by a cheater. Pellinore considers it, but then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelMercy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelMercy">spares Grummore's life</a>.
<ul><li> Pellinore and Grummore are both fairly old to be running around wearing several dozen pounds of hardware, and the description of the fight repeatedly stresses how hard it is to fight in armor, particularly since you're looking through what amounts to a keyhole and the sweat tends to run into your eyes and trying to wipe it away with your mail-clad fist risks giving you a concussion. By the point that Pellinore is knocked down, they're both extremely cranky despite both being fairly decent men. Like most things in the early part of the book, there's a moral here: if you put somebody in armor and make him fight, he's going to be pretty angry by the end even if he wasn't to start with.

</li><li> Brian Jacques enjoys using this trope to show just how dastardly a character is, and as such it's a favourite tactic for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> characters in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall">Redwall</a></em> series.

Unlike its predecessor, here enemies who spot an unarmed and motionless PC sometimes will not shoot right away but will instead draw a bead on him and slowly approach in order to knock the hero down. Naturally their approach route will just happen to pass an ambush with your knife-thrower at the ready. Can be played even straighter with your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> as bait as she is fast enough to kick an approaching croon right in the forbidden zone.

The men will kneel and beg for mercy, and the girls will sit down and cry.

Joker lets Batman capture him after a failed hostage scenario with the Mayor, just so he can get back into the Asylum. When he gets to where he needs to be, Joker easily defeats his armed guards and releases his minions from prisons. The only character who wasn't carrying an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> in letting Joker get that far was Batman, of course.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity">Batman: Arkham City</a></em> invokes the trope a few times as well: First is when Penguin begs for Batman to not hurt him, but then detonates the iceberg monument while Batman was still on it (although in this case, given that Batman implies that he might end up hurting him, it's probably more closer to responding in kind), and the Joker/<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Clayface</span> also arranges for his mooks to arrive after claiming that Batman won.
</li></ul></li><li> Also a useful but dangerous tactic in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmyOfTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmyOfTwo">Army of Two</a>: The 40th Day</em>. One player pretends to surrender, while the other gets into position. When they're ready, either the surrendering player quickdraws or the other player opens fire.

</li><li> The first boss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tenchu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tenchu">Tenchu 2</a></em> will sometimes pretend to beg for mercy before attacking.

It's unknown what exactly Wily intended to do, but his reaction when Mega Man was being infected with Evil Energy implies that his surrender was genuine, or at the very least that if he was planning to pull off the trope, he certainly didn't intend for it to happen that way. Also averted outright in regards to <em>10</em>, where after Wily was beaten by Mega Man, he ends up genuinely needing to surrender in such a way that even Mega Man seems to see it as genuine now (Wily caught a cold).
</li><li> And at the end of <em>9</em>, this is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in one of the most humorous moments in the game.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wasteland2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wasteland2">Wasteland 2</a></em> when you get Tinker's health low enough she'll end combat and offer to tell the player whatever they want to know about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>.

However, the moment he lets his guard down Hammerhead shows us one of three reasons why he got his name.
</li><li> A very common tactic in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a></em>, regardless of whether you're on the winning or losing side of a war, is to declare peace for between 10-30 turns (depending on the game) and then re-declaring war the moment the peace treaty expires. If you're winning, it lets you extort resources from your opponent that would be lost if you annihilated them right away, and it gives you time to scout out any key cities that you haven't located already. If you're losing, it gives you time to build a tech advantage and retaliate with a stronger army or set up a diplomatic alliance against your opponent that will bog them down with other wars while you prepare to attack them yourself.

<ul><li> Eggman does this quite a few times, pleading that he'll reform provided Sonic doesn't beat him to a bloody pulp, just before activating a new machine. <br/><br/>Most notable is that in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed">Sonic Unleashed</a></em> he does this at the end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdOpening">Cold Opening</a>, right at the beginning of the game.

Sadly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">that was an important requirement of the trap</a>.

Since Sonic had a fake Emerald created to sabotage the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Eclipse Cannon</a>, he acquiesces to Eggman's demands.

Naturally, the savvy course of action is to always go for the kill.
<ul><li> This is sometimes averted in outdoor fights. A bandit or what-have-you that begs for mercy might just keep on running.
</li><li> This is basically what the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">Empire</a> are trying to do with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">Thalmor</a>: sign a cease-fire on their terms and pretend to be a Vichy-esque nation while secretly and slowly building up strength so they can turn around and deliver a decisive defeat to the elves later on when an opportunity presents itself. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">Not everyone agrees with this idea</a>.

With the right skills, it can also free them from any movement-restricting effects. Combine it with their 'Dirty Kick' and another skill that lets them move much faster for a short while after using THAT, and you've got the recipe for the picture-perfect 'I Surrender, Suckers'.
<ul><li> The Sith Warrior has an opportunity to pull one of these in a cutscene when a group of Selonians on Corellia demand you surrender your lightsaber. You can pretend to comply, only to activate it when one comes close to take it and run them through.

If other enemies are nearby, 47 will instead take them hostage as a human shield, giving the player an advantage in the gunfight to follow.
</li><li> Some perps in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SWAT4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SWAT4">SWAT 4</a></em> are prone to doing this. After telling them to drop the weapon and get down, the perp will slowly do this... and then suddenly open fire on you.

She and fellow model Naomi Campbell were scheduled to settle a grudge match in the ring but had to fight in their underwear after commentator Nick Diamond accidentally splattered their clothes with Cheez Whiz. During the fight, someone threw a riding crop and a pair of handcuffs into the ring, which Naomi used to cuff Rebecca and whip her on her upper thighs as she lay prone on the mat. Rebecca begged for mercy, promising Naomi that she would get a gift if she let her go. Naomi liked this idea and uncuffed Rebecca, who kept her word by giving Naomi a wrapped package; Naomi opened it and pulled out a beautiful new fur coat. Rebecca urged Naomi to try on the coat, which she did - and then, just as Rebecca had predicted, a gang of deranged anti-fur protesters appeared out of nowhere to beat Naomi to a bloody pulp. Rebecca then stepped forward to kill the gravely injured Naomi, but Naomi managed to work up enough strength to vomit up her own stomach and squeeze it in her foe's direction, spraying Rebecca with lethal gastric acid that caused her to melt down into a puddle of flesh-colored liquid with her blue bra and panties floating on the top.

<ul><li> This tactic is also known as <em>perfidy</em> and is defined by the Geneva Convention as a war crime, as it makes acceptance of genuine surrender impossible, thus ensuring a perpetual state of warfare.
</li><li> Borderline "historical" example: The Trojan Horse ploy is a variation, in that the Greeks pretended to retreat rather than actually "surrendering" (i.e. giving up their weapons and putting themselves in their enemies' power). The Trojans turned out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfPlasticine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfPlasticine">Made of Plasticine</a> once the Greeks were inside their walls.
</li><li> In one Roman gladiator match, a group of Retiarius (gladiators armed with tridents and nets) fought a group of Secutors (gladiators with swords and shields meant to completely counter the Retiraius). The Retiarius dropped their weapons and pretended not to fight. The Secutors dropped their helmets and shields and the Retiarius killed them all. The Roman Emperor at the time was not impressed and probably had them executed.
</li><li> According to Plutarch, a soldier under the command of Julius Caesar pretended to surrender after being severely wounded. When two enemy soldiers approached to take him captive, he cut them down despite his horrible injuries.
</li><li> This trope led into one of the nastiest incidents in the Finnish Civil War - the Huruslahti Lottery, aftermath of the Battle of Varkaus, Finnish Civil War 1918. The Reds pretended to surrender, and while the victorious Whites advanced over the Huruslahti bay ice, the Reds opened machine gun fire. Naturally, the Whites were not amused at all. The Whites then made an all-out charge, crushing the Reds. Immediately after the battle, all captured Reds were ordered on line on the ice, and after the Whites had killed all the wounded Reds, they shot every fifth man, "the lottery", on the line as vengeance.
</li><li> A rare real-life example is to be found in the animal world. Apparently, one species of ants uses a similar trick to gain slaves for their colony. After an attack on a neighbour anthill, a young queen remains on the battlefield, playing dead. Once the enemy carry her into their hive's food storage chambers, she 'gets better', kills and eats their queen, and copies her pheromone makeup, causing the entire hive to treat her as the queen. The ants are doomed to die out (for lack of a genuine queen) but until they do, they work in the fake queen's home colony as if it was their own.
</li><li> A variant occurs in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoaldDahl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoaldDahl">Roald Dahl</a>'s autobiography, <em>Going Solo</em>. When confronting a group of German colonists intent on returning to Germany (to fight in World War II against Britain), Dahl raises his hands... as the signal for every gun under his command to fire a single shot over the Germans' heads.
</li><li> During the invasion of Iraq, there were reported instances of Iraqi soldiers who pretended to surrender and attacked the American soldiers when they came close.
</li><li> At the battle of Kilmichael during the Irish war of Independence, a group of British soldiers fake surrendered before commencing fire again, causing the deaths of three IRA men. The IRA commander then ordered that they be wiped out to the last man.
</li><li> The Battle of The Waxhaws in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">The American Revolution</a>. Usually seen as a brutal slaughter of helpless Americans by the nasty British, a recent theory suggests that the British thought they were victims of this trope -their leader's (Banastre Tarleton) horse was shot down, just as a flag of truce was going up, a flag not all the Americans noticed at first. It got ugly.
</li><li> During the American Civil War, Nathan Bedford Forrest did this a lot.
</li><li> One of the interviewees in Studs Terkel's <em>"The Good War"</em> relates that this was a common SS tactic. They eventually stopped accepting surrender of SS troops (which in turn may have had bearing on the Malmedy massacre.)
</li><li> The Japanese were absolutely notorious for this. So much so that many American soldiers decided that taking Japanese prisoners was not worth the risk, and shot them instead. On the other hand, many Japanese were incredulous that the Americans would actually take them prisoner and treat them decently. Once taken prisoner, they were extremely cooperative, as they had no real model for how prisoners were supposed to behave.
</li><li> This is not just exclusive from the Japanese, as most Asian countries (both East and West parts of the continent) had pulled this off many times. This is one of the <em>many</em> reasons why western superpowers were only half-successful on colonizing the Asian continent, compared with America, Africa, and Oceania and why they had to resort to either more violent or cruel methods of warfare or simply quit when they saw it didn't worth the effort.
</li><li> It is not known with 100% certainty that the Japanese were pulling this trope when they practically wiped out the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Goettge#Goettge_Patrol">Goettge Patrol<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> during the Battle of Guadalcanal, but to the few surviving Americans, it sure seemed like it.
</li><li> A Nerf gun called the "Secret Shot" had a second barrel in the handle, so you could shoot your opponent as you pretended to surrender.
</li><li> Both sides of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabIsraeliConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabIsraeliConflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> accuse one another of this, especially when the Oslo Treaties are brought up: Israelis point out Arafáts speeches claiming the agreements were just an I surrender, suckers stage in a plan that will eventually kick out Israel and establish the State of Palestine, while the Palestinians mention that Israel ignored its obligations to take down the Israeli-based settlements past the Green Line.
</li><li> This is why cops are taught to have one officer cover a captured suspect while the other secures him. For the suspect, even twitching funny is a good way to get shot.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a> XLVII, the Baltimore Ravens were at 4th down and 7 yards to go, deep in their own territory with 12 seconds remaining and only a 5 point lead. If the San Francisco 49ers scored a touchdown, the Ravens would lose the game. Instead of a straight punt out of their own endzone, Sam Koch, the punter, held the ball and ran sideways out of the endzone, scoring a safety, giving 2 points to the 49ers. This allowed the Ravens to punt (or "free kick") from their own 20-yard line with only 4 seconds left in the game. During the ensuing runback, the 49ers receiver was tackled after game time expired, winning the game for the Ravens.
<ul><li> In general, fake punts in American football fall under this trope.
</li><li> The QB Kneel play allows a leading team to waste the last 2 minutes of a half. Prior to 2011, it was technically allowed for the QB to not actually touch the floor with his knee as a form of fakery to get a cheap pass off. Since 2011 this was patched to the point that a faked knee counts like a real one anyway, and the opposing team is barred from stopping it after one too many paranoid linesmen flattened <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QBs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QBs">Q Bs</a> that were actually intending to kneel.

</li><li> This was point of the notorious "road agent's spin" or "border roll" used by particularly dishonourable Wild West gunfighters. The practitioner would seemingly surrender, offering his pistol to the opponent butt-first, then suddenly spin it back into firing position and shoot.

When that night came, he initially congratulated the latter but rather than kiss ass (like Ben Carson and other fellow Republican presidential candidates did), Cruz publicly made it clear that he wasn't endorsing Trump and even told the Republican crowd to "vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution." He was expectantly booed by most of the crowd. Some but not all (Democrat and/or Republican) weren't surprised by this action, considering Trump made some unreasonable insults about both his wife and father.

</li><li> Early in the Russian Civil War Red Army commanders would set White officers free provided those swore on their honour as officers and noblemen to not fight against Red Army anymore (regular soldiers naturally joined Red Army of their own free will). But the officers considered any word given to "peasants" null and void and led attacks against Red Army as soon as they go their troops. This led to tales of Red Army's cruelty as those understood their folly and started executing any captured White officer.
