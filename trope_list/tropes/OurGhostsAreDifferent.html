It all depends on what kind of story is being told.
</p><p><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostlyGoals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostlyGoals">Reasons include:</a></strong>
</p><p></p><ol><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">Avenge me</a>! The ghost was killed through foul play, knows it, and wants the murder avenged. Sometimes, this also comes with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearMyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearMyName">Clear My Name</a> sidebar. This one can also lead to ghosts becoming violent and angry if not avenged. They may explicitly say that they cannot rest easy in the graves until they are avenged.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfinishedBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfinishedBusiness">Unfinished Business</a>: Something that was significant or important to the person they used to be when alive remains undone. The ghost hangs around until this is done, and may or may not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeathAlwaysEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeathAlwaysEnds">move on afterward</a>.
</li><li> The ghost hasn't yet figured out they're dead, or are so attached to what they did in life they are still doing it out of habit and/or affection. This can lead to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror">Tomato in the Mirror</a> shock or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritAdvisor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritAdvisor">Spirit Advisor</a>.
</li><li> They're aware they're dead and angry at living people because they are still alive.
</li><li> That's just how the Afterlife works in this universe. No alternate dimension, Higher Plane of Existence or anything — you just become a ghost when you die.
</li><li> The ghost suffered so much in life that the spirit was drawn to the place where the worst torment took place.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingMemory">Resounding psychic echo</a>. The ghost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent">isn't even the person's soul</a>, but just a spectral imprint left behind by the person's death that's gained a form of sentience. In paranormal fields, these are usually called residual hauntings.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a>. They feel someone they love can't make it without them, or needs protection.
</li><li> No funeral, no grave — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead">they cannot rest without proper memorialization</a> — or perhaps their graves have been moved or desecrated.
</li><li> Or maybe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcessiveMourning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcessiveMourning">someone is mourning them</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcessiveMourning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcessiveMourning">too</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcessiveMourning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcessiveMourning">much</a>, and as a consequence, they are bound to this world.
</li><li> The person who arranged for their burial was a beneficent stranger, and they must make return for this good deed. This type is the original "grateful dead".
</li><li> They were very, very naughty in life and fear crossing over to the Afterlife and facing possible cosmic retribution.
</li><li> They were very, very naughty in life and ghosthood <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment">is</a></em> their cosmic retribution. If it's of a purgatorial type, sometimes humans can help out.
</li><li> They're a spirit form of some sorcerer, and actively made preparations to ensure themselves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalitySeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalitySeeker">eternal life</a> after their bodies gave up, or just ended up that way because of their power.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarredFromTheAfterlife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarredFromTheAfterlife">They were magically prevented from going to</a>, or were magically drawn back from, the Afterlife.
</li><li> The boundaries between the realms of the living and dead have been weakened; this tends to bring about <em>lots</em> of ghosts. This can be a regular, normally annual, occurrence, in which case you just want to propitiate them, or indicate serious problems as a one-time thing.
</li><li> They can move on any time they want; they just don't want to because they're having too much fun.
</li><li> There's also the odd rare case of a ghost that was never a living human being. It may have spawned from something. It may be part of a broader species that's made of the same kind of "matter" as human ghosts. It may be an animal, or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci">Genius Loci</a>. It may be a synthetic ghost made by alchemy. In cartoon setting, a ghost child can be considered to be the son of a couple of "normal" ghosts, born after the two normal ghosts's death (this is mainly to have a young ghost spectators can identify to, without addressing the issue of a child's death). Or it may be some sort of... <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">thing</a></em> pretending to be a ghost to suit its purposes.

</p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">Brown Note</a>: Some ghosts have strong psychological or even physical effects on the living. These may result from being in the presence of, seeing or hearing, or (generally the worst effects) <em>touching</em> the ghost. These effects may be temporary topermanannt, and may include:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainFever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainFever">Brain Fever</a>: Common in 19th century works. Sometimes fatal, sometimes survivable.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTouch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTouch">Death Touch</a>: Has is own entry under "powers"on this page.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">Insanity</a>, of varying duration and severity.
</li><li> Tangible physical injuries, of varying severity, often caused by a touch. Sometimes all or part of these injuries become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundThatWillNotHeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundThatWillNotHeal">Wound That Will Not Heal</a>, ranging in severity.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTouch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTouch">Death Touch</a>: This is a <em>very</em> common ability for ghosts in stories written before the 20th century; it can still sometimes be seen in later works. The death may occur instantly, or the victims may linger for a time (rarely more than a matter of days), the better to gibber madly about the unutterable <em>horror</em> of what they saw (and in the process provide story significant clues). Variants include curses, life drains,and visual or acoustic ranged effects. Especially in 19th century works, death may come by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainFever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainFever">Brain Fever</a>, or extreme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalFearInducer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalFearInducer">Fear</a>.

For some ghosts, this is the next best thing to being alive again. For others, it's simply an expedient because they can't experience what their host is experiencing.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamWalker">Dream Walker</a>: Some ghosts can inject themselves into a living person's dreams. Usually this person is someone psi-gifted, though.
</li><li> Elemental powers are not uncommon.
<ul><li> Most commonly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway">Wind</a>.
</li><li> Sometimes they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">fire</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillOTheWisp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillOTheWisp">Will-o'-the-Wisp</a> powers too.
</li></ul></li><li> Equipment the ghost used in life may become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JacobMarleyApparel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JacobMarleyApparel">ectoplasmic version of same</a> that can hurt other ghosts.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalFearInducer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalFearInducer">Fear</a>: One of the most common ghostly powers, and one almost universal for ghosts in stories written before the mid 20th century. As literal spirits of the dead, and metaphorical personifications of death itself, ghosts often induce unreasonable fear in anyone in their presence, above and beyond any <em>reasonable</em> fear they may induce. This often results in cowering, psychological paralysis, terror or even madness.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flight">Flight</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFloats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFloats">Levitation</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">Not</a> necessarily limited to the ghost itself.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace">Game Face</a>: When ghosts do not look the same as when they were alive, they can often disguise themselves as such. However posing as a human will usually result in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlamourFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlamourFailure">slight flaws</a> in their facade, like lacking a pulse or cold skin.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Intangibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Intangibility">Intangibility</a> or Phasing: The default state of ghosts tends to be intangible. They can touch and interact with physical objects if they concentrate on doing do (except in works which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheIsolation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheIsolation">play up the toll on their sanity</a>), but they usually cannot pass on their intangibility to anything they are holding - typically, if they pass through solid matter while holding something, the solid matter remains behind after the ghost has passed through. This is most common in modern works; ghosts in older stories are more likely to be solid, and some can even pass for living humans.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invisibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invisibility">Invisibility</a>: Some ghosts can choose whether they want to be visible to anybody. Others are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISeeDeadPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISeeDeadPeople">visible only to the spiritually sensitive, or to people with close personal ties to the ghost</a>. Sometimes this is dependent on the ghost's power, with strong ghosts being easier to see than weak ones.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a>: Usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">telekinesis</a> for moving and throwing things around in a ghost tantrum/poltergeist fit.
<ul><li> Other times, they can project <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScreamerTrailer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScreamerTrailer">Scary Visions</a> into the mind of a victim.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">Voluntary Shapeshifting</a>: Ghosts can sometimes morph into morbidly, gruesomely horrific, grotesque (or amusing) shapes to terrify their haunts. If their emotions flare, this effect may happen involuntarily.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherManipulation">Weather Manipulation</a>: Some ghosts can create rain, thunder, lightning, high winds, even sleet or snow. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGhostAndMrsMuir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGhostAndMrsMuir">The Ghost and Mrs. Muir</a></em>, Mrs. Muir reveals that the Ghost can never fool her about his emotional state because the weather barometer always reveals his genuine mood.
</li></ul><p><strong>Limitations include:</strong>
</p><ul><li> Some ghosts are only able to show up between sundown and sunrise.
<ul><li> Others can only appear on certain days (nights); for single ghosts, this is often a significant date in their lives, but in masses, there is often a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiminalTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiminalTime">Liminal Time</a> where ghosts walk because the boundaries between life and death are thin (which may also be year's end, or otherwise a boundary between times).
</li></ul></li><li> Some ghosts are unable to enter churches.
</li><li> Most ghosts are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosedCircle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosedCircle">restricted to haunting a specific house</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedFetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedFetter">object</a>. If you can leave the premises you're usually safe. Destroying said house or object will usually remove the ghosts' anchor to the material world and force it to move on, but it might just allow it to haunt anywhere it wants to.

This process tends to make ghosts either stronger or weaker, but rarely follows any hard rules and is likely to affect different ghosts in different ways.

</li><li> Popping in and disappearing just as fast, leaving those who saw them claiming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHereISwear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHereISwear">It Was Here, I Swear!</a>.

</li></ul><p><strong>Possible appearance:</strong>

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitodamaLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitodamaLight">Hitodama Light</a>: Another Japanese variant, where a coloured flame (usually purple) is attached to the ghost or showing a person possessed by a ghost. People wearing candles on their head are invoking this appearance.
</li><li> As they look now - rotted, filthy, partially skeletal and covered in worms or maggots, wearing the clothes they were buried in.
</li><li> If they died violently, they may be covered with their own blood, with visible deadly wounds.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogFeet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogFeet">Fog Feet</a>: Most ghosts have these genie-like tails instead of having two legs.

</li></ul><p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>
</p><ul><li> A ghost can be put to rest once their bones are salted and burned.
</li><li> Destroying an object the ghost is haunting can also make it go away.
</li><li> Ghosts can be susceptible to purified or "holy" objects, such as pure iron or salt.
</li><li> Sometimes you can simply trap them by creating a barrier of salt around them.
</li><li> Other times, you can simply help the ghost with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfinishedBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfinishedBusiness">Unfinished Business</a>, giving them reason to move on.

It can be housed in artificial hardware by replacement of organics with cybernetics (the Ship of Theseus model), though the main character worries about the certainty of her ghost's integrity.

She does have some poltergeist-like powers, like stealing and eating slices of cake right in front of a person. The crumbs somehow stick to her ghostly face.

At its conclusion, they realize that they succeeded early on and didn't notice. The implication is that ghosts in the <em>Paranoia Agent</em> universe don't know they're dead. The only visual sign of their death is that ghosts don't have shadows (as made clear when a man tries to kill himself by jumping in front of a subway train; he staggers away, bitching about his failure, but he has no shadow - and really, you can't survive that). There's an odd moment after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> when the ghosts, happy to have died, stop in the background of a schoolgirl's picture-taking; when the girls look at their photo, they scream in terror.

In both the series and the film, it is stated that Captain Gregg the Ghost remained more out of stubbornness than anything else: he had intended to renovate the house, and he was not about to let his unplanned death interfere with what he had decreed would occur! As film/series continues, he realizes how foolish it has been for him to haunt the house over petty mulishness, but by then, he had fallen in love with the widow Mrs. Muir.

<ul><li> The expanded universe details the nature of ghosts in much greater depth. Ghosts are classified by nature and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels">power level</a> but to make things confusing the "Class" terminology is used for both. In terms of classification - Class 1 is incomplete manifestations like sounds or lights, Class 2 are partial manifestations like hands or heads, Class 3 are complete humanoid manifestations - but are spirits representing ideas like Christmas such as the Ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol">A Christmas Carol</a></em> or greed rather than deceased humans, Class 4 are full-fledged apparitions and the only class that can be determined a traditional ghost of a deceased human, Class 5 (like Slimer) are non-humanoid extradimensional spirits representing emotions or emotionally-charged events (like Gluttony in Slimer's case), Class 6 are the ghosts of animals, and Class 7 are demons and gods. In Power Levels, they're ranked from Class 1 (able to cause minor lights and move small objects) to Class 11 (essentially a god).

</li><li> A ghost who'd been in the military in life had spectral, ectoplasmic machine guns that could deal damage to other ghosts.
</li><li> A ghost who was masquerading as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">The Grim Reaper</a> had a scythe that could deal damage equally to humans or other ghosts. And when this ghost was defeated, its victims turned out to be very polite, laid-back Avenge Me! types.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Poltergeist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Poltergeist">Poltergeist</a></em> had a group of ghosts who were of the "angry at the living" type. Adding insult to injury, their graves had been desecrated. They pull harmless pranks on the family, which they were invisible to the ghosts by stacking chairs, bending utensils, and breaking cups.
<ul><li> These ghosts were adept with the haunting:
<ul><li> They turned an already-creepy clown doll into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown">extremely creepy one</a>. They also manipulate gnarled trees and ectoplasmic tentacles.

The comedy featured Bill and Ted dying, coming back as ghosts, and then getting exorcised and sent to hell when they tried to communicate about their predicament. At which point they challenged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">The Grim Reaper</a> to games for their souls, and went to petition Heaven for assistance against the bad guy before returning to earth alive and well.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scoop">Scoop</a></em> had a recently deceased legendary reporter interview a recently deceased secretary who thinks she was poisoned because she found out information that could lead to a notorious serial killer. The reporter escapes back to the land of the living a few times to reveal hints, clues, or whacks with a guilt club to the school newspaper reporter he randomly appeared to the first time appeared.
</li><li> The '90s horror flick <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IdleHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IdleHands">Idle Hands</a></em> has examples of Jacob Marley Apparel and possession. After the protagonist's best friends are murdered by his hand they decide not to go to heaven and possess their own dead bodies. The bodies function normally despite the fact that one has a beer bottle in his head and the other was decapitated. They can interact normally with everyone else too. Once they duct tape the head back on they can even go out in public. So I guess they aren't really ghost even though they are dead. You know what, never mind.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RepoTheGeneticOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RepoTheGeneticOpera">Repo! The Genetic Opera</a></em> has Dead Marni. She died of a rare blood disease shortly after her daughter was born, and apparently hung around. She mostly appears to Nathan to guilt trip him.

When a person passes through the ghost, the person will sneeze.

He's actually lacking in a lot of powers associated with ghosts (apparently only able to appear and vanish at will) and can be physically harmed (even bleeding, though it's evident the only thing that actually hurts and doesn't just annoy him is his original hook).
</li><li> From the film versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRing">The Ring</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sadako Yamamura seeks vengeance upon all of mankind. Her manifestation is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">originally</span> psychically anchored to the well where she died, whereupon it projects abstract thoughts and images that can be conveniently recorded by electronic equipment. Anyone who experiences this is cursed to die in seven days, and experiences both psychic projections as well as prophetic dreams (whether they're awake or asleep.) Her appearance is similar to the clothes she died in (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StringyHairedGhostGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StringyHairedGhostGirl">a white dress</a>.)
</li><li> Samara Morgan, in addition to Sadako's attributes above, also has full control of her psychic abilities —telekinesis, psychography, possession of electronic equipment— and can also possess humans. Not only does her appearance resemble her condition upon death, but her final manifestation displays the <em>decay and rot</em> of her corpse inside the well. Not a pretty sight.

He even says at one point "I was Dave Bowman."

When he tries to touch her, she's immediately overwhelmed by her grief and wails miserably, which convinces him he should move on and spare her from the pain of his unseen, unreachable presence.

Weaker Remnants act completely at random, but stronger ones have some intelligence and are even capable of speech.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonBones">Dragon Bones</a></em>, Oreg is somewhat ghostlike, and thought to be a ghost by most of the cast. However, when Ward inherits him, he learns that Oreg is not quite a ghost, he's the <em>soul</em> of castle Hurog. Not a soul that developed along with the castle, though - he was magically <em>bound</em> to it. Ward experiences some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a> when Oreg tells him that he's basically property, and has been treated as such by many of his previous owners.
</li><li> The ghosts in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> are deadly haunts, and some cannot enter holy ground. They are also residual psychic echoes, except a very select few that can maintain their souls, mainly via interventions of major beings or via necromancy.
<ul><li> Some also displayed the wounds that killed them.
</li><li> Ghosts in the <em>The Dresden Files</em> are described as fossils, imprints of a personality. The more emotionally charged the death, the stronger the ghost. For example, graveyards in the books are always filled with ghosts, but most of them are so weak that they are imperceptible to normal people. While if someone commits suicide, or dies while emotionally distressed their ghosts can take on physical forms and even heavily effect the material world. Ghosts don't disappear unless killed by magical means or the reason they are created (normally unfinished business) is fulfilled.
<ul><li> It is possible for a ghost to be created even if someone's death is very brief, i.e., they were revived via CPR after suffering a bout of clinical death. Also, powerful individuals like wizards can leave very powerful ghosts behind when they die. In <em>Grave Peril</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Harry takes advantage of this by passing unconscious so a ghost can kill him in his sleep, only to be revived by CPR, and thus creates a ghost <em>of himself</em> that he teams up with to beat the crap out of the hostile ghost that killed him. The ghost Harry disappears once this is accomplished, as the purpose that caused him to linger as a ghost has now been fulfilled.</span>
</li><li> And in <em>Ghost Story,</em> Harry gets to know just <em>how</em> different these ghosts are, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's now one himself, a la Type One, Avenge Me style. At the end he discovers that his body is still clinically alive, having been kept on magical life support by Mab and Demonreach, enabling him to return to life and explaining why he was able to run around Chicago as a genuine disembodied soul rather than the "psychic imprint" type of ghost previously described.</span>

They can be destroyed, tainted by black magic or turned into demons, and can shatter if tainted too much.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Hogwarts is a rare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedCastle">Haunted Castle</a> where the ghosts are generally nice and have little impact on the actual plot.

After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sirius</span> dies, Harry asks Nick why more people don't choose to be ghosts. Nick, who's used to recently-bereaved students asking him stuff like this, explains that the only people who actually become ghosts are those too afraid of death to cross over, and that being a ghost is a pretty sorry state, all in all.
</li><li> Professor Binns, the teacher for magical history classes just kept coming to work even after he died. The only difference with his past life seems to be that he can now take a shortcut through the chalkboard. On the positive side, he works cheap. On the negative, he's in contention with Sybil Trelawney for the title of second-worst instructor in the school.
</li><li> The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Resurrection Stone</span> can actually call back the spirit of a person (albeit they are NOT brought back to life, their spirit has just been temporarily called), but not Priori Incantatem, which only conjures an "echo". This is likewise described as a miserable experience for both parties.
</li><li> Moaning Myrtle haunts a girls' toilet because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she had been hiding there from her tormentor, classmate Olive Hornby, when she died.

</li><li> Peeves the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Poltergeist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Poltergeist">Poltergeist</a> is most likely the last type of ghost; it's suggested that he's simply a spirit of chaos who never was a living being, and just showed up when the castle was built.

Here, the ghosts are invisible but not intangible, stuck with Jacob Marley apparel, and can only exert a very small amount of physical force at the cost of great effort. A human being touching a ghost feels a slight chill while the ghost feels a cold and sharp pain. Ghosts themselves can interact physically with each other. While lacking psychic abilities, the ghosts are very good at reading facial and body language on account of lacking things like breathing to distract them. Lastly, the ghosts are prone to falling asleep for days at a time, especially after exerting the energy to physically manipulate things.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> had an episode wherein there was a spell in effect that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheCostume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheCostume">turned your costume literally real</a>. Willow was wearing a ghost costume, so she appeared to die and became ghostly. Fortunately she returned to her body just fine after the spell was broken.
<ul><li> In another episode, a pair of ghosts of the "reliving a traumatic event" variety possess people and reenact a school shooting. Over and over.

</li><li> The show also has the recurring character of Dennis, Cordelia's phantom roommate. He's a surprisingly nice guy, considering <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his own mother bricked him up in a wall because she didn't like his fiancée.</span>
</li><li> Wesley was brought back in <em>After the Fall</em> by the Senior Partners. This is doubly ironic, as Wesley is bound to a "standard perpetuity clause" in his contract, the same as Holland Manners and Lilah. Furthermore, he now serves as liaison to the Senior Partners, taking over from Hamilton (whom Angel killed in the series finale).
</li><li> Matthias Pavayne from the episode "Hell Bound" is the ghost of a serial killer who tortures any ghosts in the L.A. of Wolfram &amp; Hart before sending them to Hell and given that W&amp;H is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilInc">Evil, Inc.</a> full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">Bad Bosses</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> even when the heroes are running it</span>, he gets a <em>lot</em> of victims, including the aforementioned Spike.

What non-word-related aspects of the world he can see can vary with the plot as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Beetleborgs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Beetleborgs">Beetleborgs</a></em> had this in the form of Flabber- a phasm who looked like a cross between Jay Leno (host of <em>The Tonight Show With Jay Leno</em>) and Elvis Presley. Flabber's a rather genie-like ghost who lived in a pipe organ until he got freed accidentally by those kids. Plus he's the one that gave them their powers.
<ul><li> On one episode of <em>The Tonight Show With Jay Leno</em> during the Monday headlines segment, a picture of Flabber was sent to Leno, which got laughs from the audience but Leno was more than just not pleased with it.
</li></ul></li><li> Filmation's <em>The Ghost Busters</em> dealt with ghosts who took the forms of classic film and literature ghosts (e.g. Count Dracula, Dr. Frankenstein and the Monster, the Abominable Snowman, etc.) but all had some comical twist.
</li><li> Subverted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Eureka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Eureka">Eureka</a></em>, when Allison thinks she's seeing a ghost, but really it's a hologram programmed into her logic diamond necklace.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em> had a full-on TANGIBLE ghost showing up when Booth was trapped on a ship about to explode. Tangible as in, could pick stuff up, could help Booth open doors, Booth physically picked the guy up and carried him... and then the guy disappeared as the helicopter came to rescue him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUK">Being Human</a></em> has Annie. She can interact and pick things up like a living human, but her visibility rides up and down the scale with her confidence. She can also teleport.
<ul><li> There's also Gilbert. In the episode he's in, it's explained that when a person becomes a ghost they can only pass on to the afterlife once they've solved whatever problem kept them from passing on in the first place (for Gilbert, it was that he never loved anyone which is solved when he falls for Annie. For Annie, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it was her fiance killing her, which is solved when she drives him mad with a secret</span>). Once they are able to move on, a ghost sees a door appear and walks through it. If a ghost is upset enough, they can become a poltergeist and move or break things mentally. Also, all ghosts can't eat or drink, can randomly teleport, and are stuck in whatever clothes they died in ("It's just as well I didn't die in a Star Trek uniform or a giant squirrel costume..."). Ghosts can also hide the living or undead by wrapping them in their clothes, referred to as "swaddling".
</li><li> They also apparently date other ghost people and force their friends to babysit their ghost babies (who need to be kept the colder the better and can't be hurt if you drop them). It's not clear if ghost babies age but they don't seem to until they pass on. They can also be calmed down by telling them ghost stories.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUS">US/Canadian remake</a> has Sally Malik. She is intangible all the time and invisible to normal humans. She cannot interact with physical objects, but seems to be able to sit on objects (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">the production team made special wooden and concrete cushions for her to sit on, but they do not conform to her body</a>). When upset, she disrupts the electronics and pipes around her. While she is initially not able to leave the house she died in, she is later taught how to leave. Objects close to the ghost, such as Sally's engagement ring, will constantly find their way back to the owner. Salt will create a barrier that ghosts cannot cross, and iron will disperse a ghost's energy, causing it to reform in the location in which it died. A ghost passes on to the other side after resolving unfinished business. As with the British version, Sally's door does not appear until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she forces her fiancé Danny who killed her to admit to his crimes</span>. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she has to pass up her door to save Aidan</span>. It is after this event that Sally discovers she can pick up and interact with physical objects. This also appears to be an ability that stronger ghosts exhibit, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">such as when Danny is able to hold the iron poker that Sally intended to disperse him with</span>. Ghosts can also possess humans, so long as the human is willing (or inebriated), and destroy each other, defined as "shredding".
</li></ul></li><li> This is played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>, when Hurley learns of Miles' ability to talk to ghosts. Hurley says that ghosts regularly talk to him and even play chess, but Miles insists that, in his experience, ghosts only represent the last thoughts of dead people and cannot interact with the living.
</li><li> Ghosts appear regularly on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em>. Their appearances are heralded by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostlyChill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostlyChill">Ghostly Chill</a>. They can be repelled with salt and iron.

Hostile ghosts tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StringyHairedGhostGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StringyHairedGhostGirl">pale with stringy hair</a>. Many attack the living through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">telekinesis</a>, and some are capable of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">possession</a>. Benign spirits and those <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror">who don't know they are dead</a> can be indistinguishable from the living. Eventually <em>all</em> ghost that haven't ascended to the afterlife end becoming vengeful spirits. In fact they've being defined to be at least 3 types of ghosts:
<ul><li> Vengeful Spirits who target people who wronged them in the past.
<ul><li> Then we got the one who became electricity and haunted the internet itself to kill his murders and one who had flesh and bloind since she grinded her own flesh and bone, mixed her blood in a painting. Also an expy of the Mona Lisa.
</li></ul></li><li> Specters who are no so different from vengeful spirits, except they leave black ectoplasm instead of the usual grenn. They posses those who feel betrayed and carry on their vengance for them, though they must hold something hauted by them.
</li><li> Poltergeist another type of vengeful spirit although unlike vengeful spirits poltergeists do not target people who committed crimes similar to how the spirit died, and more indiscriminate.
</li><li> Shojo a Japanese ghost/spirit, different from others in that it's tangible and alive, however similar to ghost, it is invisible, and only those who are drunk can perceive them.
</li><li> Demons can also be considered ghosts since Bobby said once they're nothing but ghosts with a an ego.
</li><li> Death Omen
</li><li> Death Echo
</li><li> Buruburu
</li><li> Revenant
</li><li> Woman in White
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PoltergeistTheLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PoltergeistTheLegacy">Poltergeist: The Legacy</a></em> tends to feature the wrathful variety, with the occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfinishedBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfinishedBusiness">Unfinished Business</a> thrown in.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RoundTheTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RoundTheTwist">Round the Twist</a></em> varies from episode to episode. It was based on short stories mostly out of continuity with each other, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfinishedBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfinishedBusiness">Unfinished Business</a> is a common theme - even for a ghost dog and a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries">ghost seagull</a></em>. The ghosts often seem bound by different rules - some ghosts are mute, whereas others can talk. Then out of the blue there was a (pretty hilarious) episode about a ghost who needed to complete his 'scare test' to get a better site to haunt.
</li><li> Ghosts appear all over Earth in the season 2 finale of the new series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Subverted, however, in that they are actually beings from a parallel Earth that haven't quite broken through the barrier between the worlds yet, making their appearance ethereal and roughly humanoid, although specific characteristics are impossible to make out. Of course, this doesn't stop humans from assuming they are literally their dead loved ones returning, even believing they can smell/see certain traits associated with the real person (for example, Rose's mother believes she can smell her father's cigarettes).</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanHorrorStoryMurderHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanHorrorStoryMurderHouse">American Horror Story: Murder House</a></em> the ghosts are confined to the house and its grounds (except on Halloween). They can manifest physically to an extent that they are indistinguishable from the living, which can get really confusing. They can also be invisible but can still affect the physical world. Some ghosts (like Nora Montgomery) don't seem to realize they're ghosts, some ghosts (like Chad, Patrick, and Moira) do, and some (like Tate) seem to vary based on the situation. Moira is unique amongst <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanHorrorStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanHorrorStory">American Horror Story</a></em> ghosts in that she can drastically alter her appearance; to living heterosexual men she appears young and sexy like she did when she died, to others she is a middle-aged woman (who actually looks older than she probably would have had she not been murdered).
<ul><li> Ghosts in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanHorrorStoryHotel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanHorrorStoryHotel">Hotel</a></em> are similar and expand on the rules. Those who die in places of great evil such as the Murder House or the Hotel Cortez will become a ghost no matter what. Those of great evil will also become ghosts such as the various serial killers in the Hotel. Oh, and they're immune to certain forms of magic which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Queenie</span> discovered the hard way.
</li><li> Even if you weren't evil in life, becoming a ghost tends to make one somewhat amoral, with a tendency to scare living people at best and murder then at worst, including people who haven't done anything to deserve it. As Larry from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanHorrorStoryMurderHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanHorrorStoryMurderHouse">American Horror Story: Murder House</a></em> puts it, "they've got nothing to live for anymore", and they get bored.
</li><li> There have been a few examples of living people who are aware of ghosts trying to cause their loved ones to die in a place that generates ghosts (like Constance trying to drag <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Addie</span>'s body onto the Murder House lawn so that she can't pass on, or even people who allow themselves to be killed in such places so they can hang out with their ghost friends after they die (like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Liz Taylor</span> in the Hotel Cortez).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFades">The Fades</a></em> has the titular Fades, spirits unable to move on to the afterlife.

</li><li> In "The Hunters", the ghosts of prehistoric hunters inhabit the paintings found on the walls of a 12,000-year-old cave. Every night, they leave the walls and enter the real world to kill animals belonging to the local farmers such as sheep, cattle and a brood mare.

One character can bring these spirits back, where they essentially become like regular people again; they can eat, drink, do drugs, have sex, and kill living people with ordinary implements, vanishing once their business is complete. Interestingly, while there is an afterlife, there is seemingly no God.

<ul><li> Dickie Lee's song "Laurie (Strange Things Happen)" is about a young man who picks up a girl who needs a ride. When he gets to her destination, the seat beside him is empty, though he never stopped the car. All that remains is her sweater. When he knocks on the door with the sweater to see if she went inside while he wasn't looking, the person who answers is astonished to see the sweater. It belonged to his daughter, who was killed in a car crash at about the spot where the young man picked up the hitcher girl...25 years earlier. The song was inspired by the urban legend of the Vanishing Hitchhiker.
<ul><li> The young man of the song takes Laurie back to her home, leaves, realizes he forgot the sweater he gave her to keep warm with, and goes back for it. The person at the house tells him "She died a year ago today" and that she's buried in the local cemetery. He goes there to look at her grave, and finds the sweater folded up on top of it. So, even truer to the Vanishing Hitchhiker legend.
<ul><li> All made especially effective and actually creepy by the disarming early 60's (made in 1965) music that accompanies this telling. Not surprisingly, Dickie Lee was responsible for about three or so of the songs that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonMcLean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonMcLean">Don McLean</a> called 'dirges in the dark' in American Pie—the song, not the movie series.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> This trope applies to two different music videos for the same song, Steinman's "It's All Coming Back To Me Now". In Celine Dion's version, her late lover's ghost manifests first as shadows on the walls, and then in flashbacks within mirrors, his intangible presence only becoming visible near the end. In the Meatloaf/Marion Raven version, Marion's ephemeral ghost is visible to the audience all along, but her widower Meat only becomes aware of the haunting when objects start moving by themselves in his mansion, and doesn't seem to actually see her at all.

<ul><li> Catholics believe that the dead in Purgatory can visit living people to request prayers for purification; the living should never attempt to initiate this contact, and these souls are not the same as demons. By contrast, most Protestant churches believe that all ghosts are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">demons masquerading as the spirits of the dead</a>.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">Old World of Darkness</a> games <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WraithTheOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WraithTheOblivion">Wraith: The Oblivion</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Orpheus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Orpheus">Orpheus</a></em> were both about ghosts, dealing with them in different ways. <em>Wraith</em> focused on spiritual existence and society, while <em>Orpheus</em> dealt more with blurring the lines between life and death.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">Changelings</a> killed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdIron">Cold Iron</a> would not reincarnate and could become ghosts.
</li><li> People and places that kept a ghost attached to the world of the living were called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedFetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedFetter">fetters</a>.
</li><li> Wraiths in the World of Darkness saw said same world as way darker than the living did. Shiny new cars would be dilapidated wrecks. Buildings would be all run down and in disrepair, etc.
</li><li> Wraith powers are called Arcanoi (plural of Arcanos), and range from telekinesis to limited substantialness to emotion control to possession of objects and people. <em>Orpheus</em> had similar skills, called Shades, but they were more of a direct reflection of the character's personality.
</li><li> Wraiths bear remnants of how they were killed, known as "Deathmarks."
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a></em>, ghosts are somewhat less elaborate. Whether or not they are the human soul is deliberately unclear, but magic can bind a person's soul to an anchor and thus make it into a ghost. They have trouble communicating with mortals, and the specifics of their powers (Numina) vary from ghost to ghost. A ghost tied to its Anchors is basically a psychic echo of the actual human, unable to fully comprehend that they're dead and unable to change. Once the ghost is free of its Anchors and descends to the Underworld, however, it regains its sense of self and is able to change.
<ul><li> And then there's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeistTheSinEaters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeistTheSinEaters">Geist: The Sin-Eaters</a></em>. The geists of the title are essentially ghosts who've been boiled down to the bare essence of what defined them in death (e.g., a soldier who died at Ypres in a gas attack becomes the Gasping Colonel, a gaunt figure with wheezy breath and a gas mask that appears to be made of tanned human skin). As a result, their human memories are fragmented, to say the least, but they gain access to the power sources of the Underworld and can make bargains to bring the mystically inclined back from the dead... as long as they get to come along as passengers.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> brings rather different sorts of ghosts to the field-all of which are armed to the teeth. Eldar Wraith-constructs are the souls of dead Eldar given material form, and the robotic shells of the Necrons house the souls of the long-dead Necrontyr. Necrons Wraiths in particular drive the point home, being able to phase in and out of existence. Space Marine Dreadnoughts aren't technically dead, they're just the head and vertebrae of a 'mostly dead' Space Marine hero. Although since they are inside a tank sized mini-mech you'll call them dead if they wish to be called so.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> has creatures known as Allips. To quote the book, "An allip is the spectral remains of someone driven to suicide by a madness that afflicted it in life. It craves only revenge and unrelentingly pursues those who tormented it in life and pushed it over the brink."
<ul><li> D&amp;D in its various incarnations has so many different types of undead, corporeal or otherwise, that any attempt to tell them apart merely by sight and behavior is probably quite doomed to failure. Is that figure flitting about in the ruins a ghost? A specter? A wraith? Something notionally else altogether? Usually you won't know until it attacks, and sometimes not even then. Just make sure you bring along a cleric.
</li><li> The Ghostwalk setting, which never really made it to the big time, ran with yet <em>another</em> kind of ghost. In this version, they were still the spirits of the dead, but instead of being monsters, they were playable - dead adventurers could take levels in the eidolon and eidoloncer classes to keep advancing despite being dead. This lasted until either they were raised, at which point they could swap out the ghost classes for mortal ones, or their ghost levels outweighed their normal ones, at which point they would be subjected to the Calling and they'd disappear into the afterlife. The book actually specifically recommends not including typical D&amp;D ghosts, since they'd only serve to dilute focus.
</li></ul></li><li> No surprise that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a></em> has ghosts by the truckload: about the only variants of this trope that <em>aren't</em> present are the hokey bedsheet-wearer and anything played purely for comedy.
<ul><li> Au contraire - there is, in fact a bedsheet ghost: The <a class="urllink" href="http://www.headinjurytheater.com/article73.htm">Sheet Phantom<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Admittedly it was a First Edition critter IIRC (in the Fiend Folio), but there was at least one Third Edition (unofficial) sourcebook that took every 1st ed critter that didn't make the cut and gave third ed stats for it. As well, the original Ravenloft module was in first edition, meaning a GM could insert them as well.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/InNomine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/InNomine">In Nomine</a></em>, humans who have either achieved their Destiny or met their Fate in life, and who have some kind of unfinished business, or strong attachment to some particular thing, may instead of ascending to their heavenly reward, or descending to Hell, end up lingering on the corporeal plane, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedFetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedFetter">bound to some object</a>, or place that was significant to them. Unfortunately the process requires giving up part of their being, so some ghosts end up as nothing more than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillOTheWisp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillOTheWisp">will o' wisps</a>, with no sapience, or ability to interact with the world, others end up as poltergeists, non-sapient but able to interact tangibly with the physical world, or apparitions, with intelligence, but not the ability to affect the physical world directly, true ghosts with both intelligence and the ability to interact with the physical world are quite rare, partially because they are the ones most likely to complete their unfinished business or resolve whatever attachment kept them from moving on. Of course, all types of ghost can also simply be banished, with a ritual or by destroying their anchor, or destroyed outright.
</li><li> In the world of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>, ghosts didn't even exist at first. Then the titular Exalted killed a few of the creators of the world, who were too vast and complex to be subject to the cycle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation">death and rebirth</a> they had ordained for the rest of the world. The result was the creation of the Void, and the Underworld that formed around it. Now, anyone who dies with a strong attachment to the world will end up as a ghost in the Underworld instead of reincarnating. If they're lucky, they can resolve their attachments and return to the cycle of reincarnation. Otherwise...Well, remember the Void in the middle of the Underworld? The ghosts of the slain Primordials are still there, they're bent on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">destroying everything so they can die for good this time, and they have a nasty habit of overwhelming ghosts with the desire to kill everything that lives and destroy everything that's not alive, consigning all that exists to Oblivion</a>. Or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">forging the uncooperative ones into soulsteel</a>.
<ul><li> Since humans have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnatomyOfTheSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnatomyOfTheSoul">two souls</a>, only one of which can be reincarnated, they also leave behind a Hungry Ghost, a generally animalistic entity that guards the corpse of the fallen, and can be given to rampage if they don't receive proper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead">Due to the Dead</a> or the body (or its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GraveRobbing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GraveRobbing">tomb</a>) is desecrated.
<ul><li> Which can result in the interesting scenario of an Exalted fighting the ghost of her prior incarnation when they decide to look for artifacts.
</li></ul></li><li> Also, ghosts in this game are corporeal.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/UnknownArmies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/UnknownArmies">Unknown Armies</a></em> has two different kinds of ghosts:
<ul><li> Reverants are spirits without ego. They fall into different categories based on how they died and who they were in life, but boil down to repeating actions over and over in a mindless, pathetic way. Mourners show up and crowd around dead bodies, snowfallen show up during snowstorms and sing prophetic warnings, etc.
</li><li> Then there are demons, human spirits that are entirely ego, who remain active and cognizant entirely through the force of their will and obsession. They are universally awful and dangerous because, even if their obsession is something noble, they will possess and destroy you to accomplish their goals. Add to that the fact that while they still think and feel, they're utterly lacking in the emotional depth that hormones give you, making them incapable of love or even basic empathy, and you have the nastiest creeps in the whole setting.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> has some ghosts but places them in the "Spirit" creature type, a category that also contains things that may or may not have been living people once and things that were definitely never anything else. The rules ghosts operate under also change from world to world, so it's hard to pick out a pattern.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ironclaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ironclaw">Ironclaw</a></em> has ghosts and phantoms, which fortunately cannot physically harm the living (unless they were mages in life) but they can attempt to scare someone to death. The downside of their incorporeality is that only magic can harm them, if "killed" they depart from the world of the living. There are also indistinct "spirits of the restless dead" that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer">Necromancers</a> draw their power from but can lose control of them at which point they may try to possess people or fresh corpses. And then there's shades, kind of the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingMemory">psychic echo</a>" type, which actually don't count as undead and aren't affected by Black or White magic, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Green and Purple</a> mages can communicate with or control them.

</li><li> Dogs, cats and horses can become ghosts in the same manner as Sims.
</li><li> Additionally, the ghosts in the Sims are haunters who can scare other Sims badly enough they wet themselves. Or <em>die of fright</em> — which produces a pink ghost.

<ul><li> Ghosts are just another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">type of Pokémon</a>. In general, most Ghost-type Pokémon like to play pranks on people and scare them. A key characteristic of most is that they seem to be composed mostly of gases rather than solid flesh (or, in the case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeing">Rotom</a>, plasma). And for that exact reason some people don't think of them as real ghosts in the common sense... They simply have <em>characteristics</em> of ghosts.
</li><li> The exception to that general rule are Yamask, Cofagrigus/Runegrigus, Phantump, and Trevenant who are real human ghosts. Yamask is an animated death mask (while its Galarian variant is a human ghost being drawn into a cursed rune), Cofagrigus is an animated sarcophagus, and Runegrigus is a cursed rune that used the Yamask spirit to fully restore itself, while the latter two are essentially ghost-powered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack">treants</a>.
</li><li> Drifloon and Drifblim are also stated to be human and pokemon spirits.
</li><li> Honedge, Doublade and Aegislash are ancient metal swords possessed by spirits, but are still considered ghost-types.
</li><li> Shuppet and Banette are discarded toys animated by a malevolent will. Mega Banette appears to actually be at the point where the aforementioned will has gained enough power to be able to manifest without the toy.
</li><li> One of the strangest is Shedinja, a discarded cicada shell that achieves unlife when its "parent" pokemon evolves.
</li><li> Spiritomb is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmLegion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmLegion">composite</a> of 108 wicked souls that were bound to a special stone.
</li><li> Golett and Golurk are golems from a far earlier civilization who may or may not be powered by magic or actual ghosts.
</li><li> Sandygast and Palossand are animated sand cursed by the grudges of restless dead Pokemon.
</li><li> Mimikyu is some sort of unseen spirit with a horrifying appearance that (poorly) disguises itself as a Pikachu.
</li><li> Dhelmise is one of the strangest - it's the soul of <em>seaweed</em> possessing living seaweed fronds that binds itself to oceanic debris for form.
</li><li> Sinistea and Polteageist are spirits inhabiting tea who pour themselves into china to hold their form.
</li><li> Galarian Corsola and Cursola are undead coral.
</li><li> Dreepy, Drakloak, and Dragapult are undead prehistoric amphibians.
</li><li> Sableye is a kobold, not a ghost, and is thus closer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a> than anything else.

<ul><li> The first installment of <em>Luigi's Mansion</em> has a couple distinct types of ghosts. The mooks are not actual spirits, but rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtInitiatesLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtInitiatesLife">Vincent Van Gore's paintings come to life</a>. The "Portrait Ghosts", on the other hand, are truly undead, as their short biographies sometimes describe their lives, and the mansion has a few portraits of what seem to be living versions of them. Bogmire is an exception to this, as he's said to be a manifestation of the mansion's fear. The baby Chauncey's biography claims he was somehow <em>born</em> a ghost.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansionDarkMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansionDarkMoon">Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon</a></em> has the ghosts from Evershade Valley, and these ones seem to be kept harmless by the Dark Moon. When it's broken by King Boo, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainingBolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainingBolt">Restraining Bolt</a> gets removed and they attack on sight.

At least among the mooks, these ghosts are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">also normally friendly, only attacking under the orders of Hellen Gravely and King Boo. Once the latter's crown disappears, they regain their senses and help Luigi and friends reconstruct the fallen hotel.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:

</li><li> Poes returned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em> with a different look. They can only be seen with Wolf Link's sense ability. The game also features ghost rats, which slow you down.
</li><li> <em>Twilight Princess</em> features the ghost of the Zora Queen. It also features the very chilling ghosts of the guards of Hyrule castle, who silently and desperately point Link to the Princess.
</li><li> The very first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> game featured ghosts called Ghinis haunting the graveyard in the West of Hyrule. Most games since have featured ghosts of some sort, including friendly ghosts and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossFight">boss fights</a> against ghosts. Also of note: in the first game, Peahats (flowery enemies fluttering around the screen) are described as being the spirits of <em>dead plants</em>.
</li><li> Princess Zelda herself is a fairy-like ghost in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks">The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks</a></em>. So we got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolTrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolTrain">Cool Train</a> and a Princess who also is a Ghost who also is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy">Exposition Fairy</a> who can also possess living suits of armor. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot">Ninja Pirate Zombie Robot</a>, anyone?

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metroid">Metroid</a></em> series gives us Phantoon, a flying, bulbous, tentacled thing with an eyeball in its mouth. Its powers include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invisibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invisibility">invisibility</a>, levitation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntangibleMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntangibleMan">intangibility</a>, and attacking with flaming blue balls of plasma. Apparently it gets its nutrition by sucking on the electrical current of the wrecked ship it lives in. Also inhabiting the wrecked ship are coverns, ghost-like entities that look like half a dozen rotting human heads rolled together into a ball. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then he returns in <em>Other M</em>, where he's also absolutely huge with some sort of dimensional powers.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacMan">Pac-Man</a> is a partial subversion. Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde (or Sue) are ghosts that are deadly unless Pac-Man (or Ms. Pac-Man) eats a power pill. Them being ghosts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlipFlopOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlipFlopOfGod">may not be true</a>. They're referred to as either "monsters" or "ghost monsters", the "ghost" part being due to an early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nickname</a>. They appear to be alive and made of flesh, instead of being dead and untouchable.
</li><li> The Unsent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>, who look and act like alive people do, but due to the absence of a Sending (in which the dead person's soul is sent to the afterlife by a summoner) they stick around.
<ul><li> Though some can also be held to the realm of the living if their death was unclean — e.g., they were killed before their time through malice <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">such as Lord Jyscal</span> — or if they have unfinished business <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with examples including Auron and possibly Maester Mika. I suppose if you think about it, Yu Yevon also counts.</span>
</li><li> Then there are the Fiends, the creatures most frequently encountered in battles. Essentially, if a dead person is consumed by resentment towards their death but lacks the strength of will to keep their mind together (as is the case with an Unsent) they become a Fiend, a vicious, monstrous entity that roams (or indeed, haunts) the land looking for living people to prey upon. As it turns out, the tendency for deceased people to become Fiends is actually the most pressing reason why sendings are performed.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaUnderworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaUnderworld">Ultima Underworld</a> II</em> has various kinds of ghosts.

<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Poltergeist">Poltergiests<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> are considered to be separate from the other types of spirits. Instead, they're constructs created by unusual powers. For example, the <a class="urllink" href="http://touhou.wikia.com/wiki/Prismriver_Sisters">Prismriver sisters<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">were created to resemble</a> the sisters of their creator, a girl named Layla.

They can naturally come into existence or can be produced by magic or the deceased. They lack physical bodies and generally have inspecific forms, but are able to convert what they experience into thoughts, producing identity, and can passively influence the emotions of living people. The following are all subtypes of phantoms.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://touhou.wikia.com/wiki/Perfect_Memento:_Encyclopedia:_Ghost">Ghosts<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> are the souls of the dead who don't realize that they are dead, are strong enough to be unwilling to accept their deaths, or have some other significant attachment to the world of the living, and do not go to be judged. Only humans can become ghosts. Normally a white tear-like blob of floating spectral matter, strong ghosts can maintain human-like forms and participate in human-like activities. They possess enough physical composition to be able to manipulate things and just enough to make it hard for them to pass through physical substance freely. They must remain protective of their physical remains as it is their primary weak spot. The most notable ghost in the series is the carefree and whimsical <a class="urllink" href="http://touhou.wikia.com/wiki/Yuyuko_Saigyouji">Yuyuko Saigyouji<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> who resides in Hakugyokurou (generally translated as the Netherworld).

She is followed around by her own ghost manifested externally, separate from her living body. In other words, she's literally half dead. It's not clear how this originally happened, but there was at least one other half-ghost before her and it's implied she was born that way.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://touhou.wikia.com/wiki/Vengeful_Spirit">Vengeful spirits<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> are ghosts that had committed sins while they were alive. Certain kinds of youkai can also create vengeful spirits if they steal a human's body before their spirit properly moves on.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://touhou.wikia.com/wiki/Mima">Mima<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is apparently a vengeful spirit, but it's spelled differently - <em>akuryou</em> instead of <em>onryou</em>. It may be a result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a>, and unless a miracle happens <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">it's probably never going to be explained.</a>

Often these events involve the violent death of the individual, such are one ghost reenacting his own suicide.
<ul><li> On the other hand, the "ghosts" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite">BioShock Infinite</a></em> are actually quantum superpositions of two versions of the same person from different universes, one living and the other dead. They are aware of their state, but most are paralysed with confusion over which version of themselves they are. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lady Comstock, on the other hand, is <em>angry</em> about her state, and is able to extend the power of the dimensional tear that brought her back to resurrect dead enemies as her henchman.</span>

One region in the game has them aggro depending on if you've defeated more of them or the beastmen that murdered them. Appease them enough, and they won't attack you unless you engage them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFrame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFrame">Fatal Frame / Project Zero</a></em>: The games are all about people being drawn to/trapped in haunted areas, the spirits of the dead are either the original inhabitants who died during a horrible supernatural event, or the spirits of other people who later became trapped and killed by the ghosts there. There is also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Camera Obscura</a>, your only weapon in the games, which seems to steal energy from the ghosts until they can no longer materialise (as opposed to capturing them, since they have a habit of turning up again later).
</li><li> A number of characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killer7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killer7">Killer7</a></em> are ghosts (officially named "Remnant Psyches"). In particular, the syndicate's first kill, Travis, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrExposition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrExposition">Mr. Exposition</a>. Ghosts spoke in terrible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">Gratuitous English</a> in the original Japanese version; in the American version, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism">ghosts can't speak in coherent language, sounding like they're talking through a garden hose</a> - though you can still make out the original Engrish in places.

To achieve this, she must unite them with an object that was dear to them during their lifetimes. For instance, the baby wants its rattle; a weeping woman wants her locket, the miser desires a pouch of money; a soldier is searching for his medal; a little boy wants a toy horse. Oddly enough, all these objects are found <em>in the graves</em> of these individuals, alongside their earthly remains...leading one to wonder why that wasn't enough to set them all at rest, or why the ghosts themselves didn't know where these items were.
<ul><li> Of course, the requisite shovel can be used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">precisely</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostForever">five times</a>.

</li><li> Ghosts in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em> are immune to 'normal' weapons and arrows (they pass though them) but are apparently solid if you try to walk pass them, even able to hit you.

They don't seem to have any special powers, and do nothing but harass the party (either by attacking them or just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsLongAsItSoundsForeign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsLongAsItSoundsForeign">speaking nonsense</a> and then running away faster than you can catch up). Some also speak intelligibly, either replaying scenes from their lives (usually having to do with their deaths) or singing creepy songs.

The main antagonist of the series, Alma, has been dead for nearly 30 years, walks through walls, teleports, and does other things you'd expect of a ghost... yet still seems to have a physical body; her full powers weren't unleashed until her corpse is released from its stasis pod, and at the end of the second game, she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gets pregnant</span>. She also is able to conjure hundreds of ghostly beings out of her fractured psyche unconsciously.

They can possess inanimate objects and manipulate them to interact with the physical world more easily, but binding too strongly to their body makes them vulnerable to physical attack (as seen with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mettaton and, in the No Mercy route, Mad Dummy</span>).
<ul><li> Although if you want scary ghosts, forget the ghost and skeleton monsters, <em>try the ACTUAL undead in this setting</em>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CasperTheFriendlyGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CasperTheFriendlyGhost">Casper the Friendly Ghost</a></em> is a complicated case. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>, he was a boy who died of an illness, but in the comic books... it would seem that ghosts in the comicverse are one more Enchanted Forest species, not humans who die. The animated shorts do little to clarify, though one does involve a fox that Casper tried and failed to save becoming a ghost.
<ul><li> As for abilities, "Ghostly Powers" in the comics are kept <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">very consistent</a> and what they are is told often: they can fly, become invisible, or become intangible - all under the ghost's control. Occasionally, Casper encounters a "ghostproofed" wall or prison. What is inconsistent is which objects can be turned invisible or intangible along with the ghost: Spooky's hat <em>never</em> becomes invisible with him and has given him away many times, but Pearl's bow has changed with her sometimes and not others.

<ul><li> Danny himself is a subversion, as he's "half-ghost" and arguably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositoryThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositoryThemeTune">never died</a>. So is Vlad Plasmius. And because she was created, so is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a>, Dani Phantom.
<ul><li> Danny and Vlad both have the power to duplicate themselves, which may or may not be a power particular to half-ghost/half-humans.
</li><li> It isn't - Vortex did it too.
</li><li> Danny has the "Ghostly wail" which is a powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout">sonic attack</a>, effective on ghosts. This seems also to be a power particular to half-ghost/half-humans.
</li><li> Danny has the ghost sense (an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Homage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Homage">Homage</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>'s spider sense), which turns out later to have been the precursor to his freezing power.
</li></ul></li><li> Ember McLain got power from the adulation of fans she never got in life.
</li><li> Desiree was obligated to grant wishes, though not always as the wisher <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie">would have preferred</a>.
</li><li> Sidney Poindexter was bullied in life so much that his spirit haunts a ghostly clone of Casper High circa 1955. Seeing people get bullied turns on his poltergeist rage. He once possessed Danny under the mistaken impression Danny was a bully.
</li><li> Ghosts in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse">'verse</a> are capable of reproduction. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Box Lunch is the future child of the Box Ghost and the Lunch Lady</span>.
</li><li> Possession is called "overshadowing" instead because it's a kids show.
<ul><li> And for some reason, despite at least one common victim stating more than once that he hates being overshadowed, the concept of overshadowing people without their permission for no good reason being an immoral violation not befitting a hero is never, ever touched upon.
</li></ul></li><li> Ghost animals:
<ul><li> The ghost puppy who got Danny in touch with Valerie could morph from cute puppy to vicious hound until Danny resolved his issue — he only wanted his squeaky toy.
</li><li> Vlad Masters has a hunting lodge. Every animal that appears as a trophy on the wall is a ghost animal under Vlad Plasmius' thrall. He also has ghost vultures.
</li><li> Youngblood has a ghost sidekick which could morph into an animal of its choice to fit whatever costume Youngblood was using at the time (Parrot for pirate, Horse for Cowboy).
</li><li> Wulf is a ghost <em>werewolf</em> who speaks broken <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EsperantoTheUniversalLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EsperantoTheUniversalLanguage">Esperanto</a></em>.
</li><li> Every other ghost is made of ectoplasm and doesn't resemble any living or human being.
</li></ul></li><li> Nonhuman Ghosts:
<ul><li> Skulker is a weird little ghostly entity who does not appear to have ever been human; he wears a cybernetic suit.
</li><li> The ghosts who taught Danny to use his freezing power are all appear to be Yeti, or something similar.
</li><li> There's a ghost who is a plant and who controls them.
</li></ul></li><li> Ghost Gear:
<ul><li> There's a metal that harms ghosts or half-ghosts.
</li><li> Johnny 13 has a ghost motorcycle.
</li><li> Youngblood has a ghost pirate ship.
</li><li> Ember's ghost guitar would let her use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a> based on what song she was playing.
</li><li> Skulker has a number of ghost traps, weapons and devices (with the weakness of being hackable by normal earth tech).
</li><li> Technus could literally be the ghost in the machine (which is not the same as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostInTheMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostInTheMachine">Ghost in the Machine</a> trope). Danny could as well.
</li><li> Jack and Maddie Fenton were able to invent and use (with varying degrees of success) devices that protected from ghosts or trapped them. The garage sale episode featured a lot of mundane stuff the family owned getting contaminated with ectoplasm.
</li><li> Enemy Freakshow has a staff with a gem on it that exerts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a> on ghosts. Danny is only partially susceptible.
</li></ul></li><li> Overall, it seems that in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a> there are three main types of ghosts. 1) Ghosts of people/creatures who died, like Poindexter and Cujo. 2) A entity that was never living, but seems to be a unique life-form formed of ecto-plasm, who can create races and even reproduce. (Such as the race of the 'Far Frozen'). 3) A concept or idea that has taken on conscious form. Clockwork is the ghostly form of Time, Vortex the manifestation of bad weather, etc. Half ghosts (Danny and Vlad) seem to be still-living humans with ectoplasm fused to their DNA in a similar vein as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The animated <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Beetlejuice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Beetlejuice">Beetlejuice</a></em> has most of the same tropes as the movie, but:
<ul><li> The method of death showing up on the ghost has been removed. It's a kids' show.
</li><li> The Neitherworld, where Beetlejuice dwelled, was full of nonhuman ghostly entities.
</li><li> Beetlejuice himself was arguably an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> version, since he displayed all kinds of strange powers most other ghosts didn't seem to have.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10">Ben 10</a></em> has Ghostfreak who is a ghost-like alien.
<ul><li> Who then becomes a lot scarier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithout">when he escapes</a>, and wants <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">Revenge</a> on Ben. We also find out then, that without the protective shell that the Omnitrix generated, sunlight destroys Ghostfreak.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> has Starscream the ghostly <em>robot</em>. He has a unique reason for his existence: his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent">spark</a> is indestructible and can continue to exist without a body.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>, an old house is revealed to be haunted by ghosts because some electric wires crossed under a nearby graveyard.

Except they're actually just holographic projections of the dead robots, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself">which is completely different,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotUsingTheZWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotUsingTheZWord">of course</a>.
<ul><li> Hermes does comment that the last ghost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead">died</a> over 200 years ago, to which Bender responds with "the last <em>human</em> ghost."
</li><li> In the episode "Ghost in the Machines", Bender dies and emerges as a ghost. The Robot Devil explains to him that he's stuck in Limbo — "Your software was exported to the computational cloud. Your disembodied programme is now running on the wireless network shared by all machinery." Bender later discovers that his software can control electronics, and uses this to haunt Fry.
</li><li> In one episode, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackPairing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackPairing">a ghost is seen married to a horse.</a> It's unknown what type of ghost this is.
</li></ul></li><li> The ghosts of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters">The Real Ghostbusters</a></em> usually resembled living monsters more than ghosts; discussions of death were <em>verboten</em> in Saturday morning fare at the time.
<ul><li> There were a few notable exceptions to this. "The Old College Spirit" featured ghosts who were deceased frat brothers who had failed to graduate. "Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Ghost" had the ghost of a man trying to reconnect with his beloved niece so that he could say goodbye before departing. "The Man Who Never Reached Home" featured Simon Queg, a spirit forced to wander the Earth for his misdeeds in life, until he confronted his darker self. "Bustman's Holiday" had ghosts that were explicitly from a battle on the Scottish moors. And "The Bird of Kildarby" had a group of Irish ghosts who were haunting a relocated castle. "The Last Train to Oblivion" featured the ghost of Casey Jones. "Ghostfight at the OK Corral" featured Doc Holiday and the Earps.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FilmationsGhostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FilmationsGhostbusters">Filmation's Ghostbusters</a></em> had ghosts that could take tangible form in our dimension; a Dematerializer stripped them of these forms and forced them to escape to the Spirit World.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes">Jimmy Two-Shoes</a></em> had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Beezy</a> being haunted by the ghost of his uneaten pizza crusts.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DudeThatsMyGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DudeThatsMyGhost">Dude, That's My Ghost!</a></em>, the ghost of Billy Joe Cobra can twist his form into all kinds of shapes, and his ectoplasm can have bizarre effects on both living people and inanimate objects. He can also only be seen by someone if they are wearing one of his former possessions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PacManAndTheGhostlyAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PacManAndTheGhostlyAdventures">Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures</a></em>: In addition of the Ghost Gang, there are more various types of ghosts present. Some look like the old designs of the original four and even turn blue when frightened. Others however look vastly different such as the red four-eyed black jellyfish-like ones, the Japanese thunder god-like Ghosts and the large cyclops-like brutes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a></em>. The series has quite a few actual ghosts alongside the fake ones, ranging from one shot gags (like haunted bones or mice or things from the end of certain episodes), to almost demon like Witch's Ghost in one of the animated movies to (as it says on the tin) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheThirteenGhostsOfScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheThirteenGhostsOfScoobyDoo">The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo</a></em>, all of which have unique powers and abilities.
