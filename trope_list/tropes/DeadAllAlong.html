<ul><li> Carrossea Doon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Madlax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Madlax">Madlax</a></em>. He only stays around because of both his love for Margaret and the fact that he doesn't even remember he's dead. When he realizes that he fits in here, he actually fades away.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em>:
<ul><li> Souji Mikage, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a> of the Black Rose Duelist arc, is commonly interpreted as some kind of ghost that hung around Ohtori Academy long after dying.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AdolescenceOfUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AdolescenceOfUtena">Adolescence of Utena</a></em>, Kiryuu Touga was a boy that Utena, Juri, and Shiori knew in their childhood that tried to rescue Juri from drowning, but ended up dying himself. He shows up at Ohtori Academy, looking as he would were he alive, and those three are the only ones who can see him.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn">Sega Saturn</a> game adds Sanjouin Chigusa, sort of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a> to Mikage. (The latter is, somewhat remarkably, still in the game.)
</li></ul></li><li> Shito and Shiba in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZombieLoan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZombieLoan">Zombie Loan</a></em>, and in the former case he was actually <em>born</em> dead. Don't try to think about that one too much...
</li><li> Schwarzwald in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO">The Big O</a></em>. Even after it's revealed that he's actually dead, he appears again, even killing a major villain, Alan Gabriel, though how <em>alive</em> Gabriel really was is a point of debate...
</li><li> Enjou in the fifth <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KaraNoKyoukai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KaraNoKyoukai">Kara no Kyoukai</a></em> movie was revealed to have been effectively dead all along, killed and resurrected in an artificial body by Araya, so that he'd bring Shiki to him. Soon after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a>, in which Enjou comes across his own preserved brain in the basement of the building, Araya kills him for good.
</li><li> Yuzuki in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl">Hell Girl</a>: The Cauldron of Three</em>. Apparently she died as a young child soon after her parents, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialServicesDoesNotExist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialServicesDoesNotExist">Social Services Does Not Exist</a>, but continued her un-life in an illusion of normalcy.
</li><li> Mune-Mune in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalShoppingArcadeAbenobashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalShoppingArcadeAbenobashi">Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi</a></em>. She passed away before Sasshi was born. Sasshi's reaction to finding out that throughout the whole series, he was flirting with his <em>grandmother</em> is priceless.
</li><li> Yuuko Ichihara in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/XxxHOLiC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/XxxHOLiC">×××HOLiC</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle">Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-</a></em>, who is not "dead" as such, but has simply had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityBreakingParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityBreakingParadox">tell reality to ignore the fact that she died for several hundred years.</a> When she moves on, things reset and it is as if she had died when she, er, died. Yeah, descriptive words get kinda difficult here. However her death couldn't completely set right the multiverse. The consequences had twisted reality beyond repair. There was also an earlier story about a girl who thought there was a ghost in her house and wanted it removed. Yuuko <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie">tricks her into wording it</a> as "for my house to not be scary anymore". As it turns out, that girl is the ghost.
</li><li> Three suicidal people in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ParanoiaAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ParanoiaAgent">Paranoia Agent</a></em> decided to meet up after chatting online about how they wanted to end it all. They decided to form a suicide pact, meet up in real life, and discussed how they wanted to end it all. One of them didn't want to die through painfully violent means, like in a car crash or jumping off a building. One of them didn't want to kill himself directly, such as slitting his throat, and the last one wanted to make sure that their bodies would be discovered, so the world would know they existed at all. They soon went through <em>numerous</em> botched attempts, such as hiding in a condemned building while it was being torn down, and carbon monoxide poisoning by running a car inside a closed garage. Finally, they thought it would be great to get Little Slugger to kill them, after all the media attention this character was getting through the numerous deaths related to him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a> as Little Slugger ends up running away from <em>them.</em> By the end of the episode, the three become dejected and weigh their options again, while watching the sun set. In an especially ironic twist on this trope, the eldest of the three noticed that none of them had a shadow and slowly pieced it all together. For the audience watching, the point when they lose their shadows was just after the "failed" attempt at carbon monoxide poisoning.
</li><li> Appears in the hentai manga <em>Alice in Sexland</em>, of all places. The comic opens with Alice running away from her life of forced prostitution and falling into a hole, as per the original story. Near the end, however, the Queen of Hearts reveals that Alice broke her neck in the fall and that Wonderland is simply Purgatory - and that it's only big enough for one real person, who fills the role of the Queen of Hearts, meaning that the current Queen went through the situation herself and now has to move on to make room for Alice.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChieShinoharaTheBestCollection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChieShinoharaTheBestCollection">Chie Shinohara: The Best Collection</a></em>'s <em>Someone In the Dark...</em>, Masami's mother and younger brother were dead all along. They were killed by the robbers Masami encountered on her way home, but their spirits appeared, in order to keep Masami safe.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KiriNoMoriHotel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KiriNoMoriHotel">Kiri no Mori Hotel</a></em>
<ul><li> Yui Aizawa, who was going to choose between her two lovers, but was killed by one of them before she could tell them her decision.
</li><li> Riyako Hidaka, Mariko's abusive mother. She has actually been dead for years and it was merely her spirit that was in the hotel, so that Mariko, now an adult, could come to terms with her past.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em>:
<ul><li> Alice is thought to be a ghost. She was incredibly pale, and literally disappeared after she did all that she could to help the Tamers. It is also hinted by several characters that she was already dead. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a></em> neither confirms nor denies this.
</li><li> Shibumi was going to be one of these, with his body dead and his mind uploaded to the digital world. This is openly foreshadowed quite a bit, but in the end the writers liked him so much that they didn't want to shelve him for the entire (earth centric) finale. He turned out to just be in a coma, and eventually woke up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier">Digimon Frontier</a>,</em> the following series, has Koichi. His backstory has him falling down a long staircase after chasing after Koji, and notably skips over how he got from there to being in the Digital World. More than once, when everyone gets injured and the barcode effect that represents their data is revealed, Koichi alone doesn't have any. One of the villains taunts by breaking it to him that it's because he's only a spirit. Similar to Shibumi, it turns out he's only in a coma and connected to the Digital World via his hospital equipment and he awakens in the finale.

In another issue, Nozomu is talking to a student one on one, no one in the classroom but them... until Kafuka is suddenly there to comment on what was said. Nozomu only reacts with mild annoyance at the interruption... but we do not see Kafuka and the other student at the same time, they never once speak to each other, and there was no sign of anyone entering or leaving. Kafuka was just <em>there</em> and the other girl just <em>wasn't,</em> then the other way around. There are in fact several instances of her being where someone else just was, or someone else being where she just was, though it's rarely <em>that</em> blatant. The big one is when her arm is fully wrapped in a bandage in one scene; <em>her</em> being injured was never mentioned, but another student's arm was similarly bandaged earlier.</span>

It foreshadows that the main character drowned before the events of the story, and everyone is acting nice to try to keep her from remembering and passing on, while her love interest is being deliberately cold to her to try to get her to. Except that it turns out it's the exact opposite situation — she's the only <em>survivor</em> of an accident where her class' bus fell into the ocean. The others wanted to keep her from waking from a coma so she could join them forever, while the love interest was saving her life, making her question the situation so she'd wake up.

Shimizu is an immature, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">imaginative</a>, and somewhat delusional boy who acts like she's still alive even into his 20s.

The "Abullah" that is acting as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is actually Goji, the android with the most advanced artificial intelligence ever built. Doctor Tenma used a memory drive with Abullah's last thoughts to stabilize Goji. Unfortunately, since Abullah's last thoughts were full of hatred and a desire for revenge, this turned Goji into a doppelganger of Abullah wholly dedicated to destroying everyone involved in Persia's downfall. Goji/Abullah has a breakdown when Tenma reveals the truth, reverting to his blank nondescript appearance.

The reason the passengers were disappearing one by one from the protagonist's group therapy sessions was not because of a conspiracy, but because they accepted their deaths and were able to cross over. This is averted with David Morse's character: He was the pilot of the plane and knows he's dead, but can't move on because of his guilt over thinking (incorrectly) that he caused the crash.

However, the truth is, as the nonlinear timeline shows, Kevin actually killed Franklin and Celia BEFORE the massacre at the school.

The truth is revealed when Frankie visits his wife Lorraine's grave and Joey's grave is next to it. In hindsight, there were multiple clues to Joey's nonexistence: he walks rather than drives to the prison; he never eats; nobody besides Frankie ever interacts with him; and his number isn't recorded on Frankie's phone despite him having called it.

<ul><li> The story usually goes like this: Bob is driving home when he picks up Alice, a teenage hitchhiker. He drives her home and she goes into the house. He then realizes that she forgot her jacket (or scarf, some other accessory, etc) and goes up to the house to give it back to her. Her parents answer the door.

</li><li> Other versions of the story have the hitchhiker vanishing after warning the driver about an upcoming turn ("What about that turn?" "I died there"), or insisting to be left by a dark side of the road, sometimes in the pouring rain, for no apparent reason. The driver accedes, but gives the hitchhiker his jacket to cover herself. He then watches her get in a cemetery and finds his jacket hanging on a tombstone. In other versions, the driver doesn't see the cemetery but returns to the same place during the day, finding the cemetery and then his jacket on a tomb.
</li></ul></li><li> Yet another similar story has a driver picking an elderly male hitchhiker. The man has been driving for a long time and is tired. A one point he is about to fall asleep, but the old hitchhiker wakes him up, just in time to avoid a coming truck. The hitchhiker has however disappeared, and the man ponders if he has just dreamed the whole encounter. When he arrives in his destination (usually a hotel or a home for the elderly) he is told that one of the guests died the day before, and you guessed it, it was the old hitchhiker.
</li><li> There is a story in Japanese folklore, called <em><a class="urllink" href="http://hyakumonogatari.com/2010/09/14/the-yurei-child/">The Yurei Child<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, which involves a man named Kenhei and his wife. He was due to marry her but he fell ill before he could bring her back to Edo, leaving her to think she was betrayed, thus dying of a broken heart. She returned to him as a ghost and, after explaining what had happened, he married her, had a child with her, and lived like that for three years. After three years, she disappeared and, unaware, he went to her mother's house, where the old woman informed him that she had died.

He then remembers that he died outside the ship nearly a year ago so the cold preserved his body (unlike the desiccated skeletons of his comrades.)

Fortunately, the Doctor convinces her to fight for the control of her body, and she ends up helping them.

The Romulan agrees to take messages to Starfleet and their loves ones with him to deliver after the <em>Voyager</em>'s disappearance. Unfortunately, after he leaves, Tuvok reveals that, historically, the Romulan died long before the <em>Voyager</em> launched.

</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em>, the entire reason Mulder lives and breathes the X-Files can be tied back to the abduction of his younger sister when they were children; he blames himself for not protecting her. His ultimate goal, as he tells Scully in the pilot, is to find her. Over the course of the series, we are led (as is Mulder) to believe she's alive. At various points, we even see her as an adult. They all turn out to be clones, but they and various others involved in the conspiracy, continue to give Mulder hope by implying that his sister is alive. Even the episode that wraps up her story-arc is hopeful; after she was abducted, she lived with CMS Spender and his son Jeffrey, and forced to undergo painful tests. She was taken to an emergency room some six years later, but the nurse is unable to tell Mulder anything more than that she just disappeared. It isn't until Mulder and Scully are involved in a seance at the gravesite of many dead children, that Mulder finds out the truth. One child spirit takes his hand and leads him to a field where many children's ghostly forms run and play. One of the spirits runs up to him and envelopes him in a tight hug. As she pulls away, Mulder can see that the child is Samantha. Since before the start of the series, she has been dead, unbeknownst to her heartbroken brother.

However, Michael had struck a deal with FIB agent Dave Norton to ensure that he and his family would be safe, meaning that Michael had spent all the time after that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead">Faking the Dead</a> and that it was actually Brad who died and was buried; and Dave had been responding to Trevor's letters as Brad.

At least, given his disfigurement, even without several comments he makes about how he'll fade when the curse disappears, it's pretty natural to assume he's another reanimated corpse. But a secret scene added in version 2.0, only viewable after earning the true ending, reveals that *gasp* <em>he was alive all along!</em> It's not entirely clear <em>why</em> he pretended to be dead, but it's certainly interesting for being an ordinary human to be the big plot twist.

At one point in the game Snake drowns, and in this state of "almost death" meets that man in a dream, at which point he introduces himself as The Sorrow. It's only after the "battle" with him that Snake learns the truth: The Sorrow was the lover of The Boss - Snake's mentor and mother figure - and was also killed by her willingly so when their respective missions forced them to clash.

</li><li> In the short, free game <em>P.R.I.C.E</em>, Ivry is this, as Iva killed him and had his soul put into a puppet before the game. Iva may be this as well, since we see flashes of her beheaded body, and the mysterious man implies that the skull at the end is hers.

She was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">Ill Girl</a> who died in 1999 due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDiseaseThatShallNotBeNamed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDiseaseThatShallNotBeNamed">The Disease That Shall Not Be Named</a>, and in the afterlife started to grow resentful when she felt that she was alone and died for no meaning. Chronos, one of the aspects of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">Death</a>, took an interest in her and tried to get her to speak to him by replicating the school she was supposed to go to (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Yasogami High</a>), but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteTheRightThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteTheRightThing">that only made things worse</a> as it reminded poor Rei what she missed out on because she died so early.

Once the player gets through all the labyrinths, Zen's memories return to him, he gives Rei her memories back, and things get sour from there.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a> Royal</em> you get a clue from Sojiro that a 15-year old girl died from a lethal traffic accident a month prior to your arrival during the second day of the game. This is a dialogue that does not appear in the Vanilla <em>Persona 5</em> and the main heroine, Kasumi Yoshizawa is 15 years old. A few months into the game, Kasumi will tell you that she had a sister that she wanted to go to gymnast internationals with as a duo, but she died because of the traffic accident, which makes you think that Kasumi didn't die...Until the 2nd of January of the next year where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Takuto</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeUsedToBeFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeUsedToBeFriends">Maruki</a> displays you the truth...Kasumi was indeed the girl died of the traffic accident, and this Kasumi is actually <em>Sumire</em>, Kasumi's suicidally depressed sister who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSecondBest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSecondBest">Always Second Best</a> from her, and this resulted in an inferiority complex towards her that tipped to the point where she had a fit and ran away from Kasumi, only to not notice incoming traffic. Sumire only survived because Kasumi took her place to become roadkill. This obviously worsens her suicidal depression and the only way for her father to deal with it is to let Maruki <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashingForTheGreaterGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashingForTheGreaterGood">make her think she's Kasumi</a>.
</li><li> In the bonus chapter of <em>Phantasmat 3: The Endless Night</em> the main character is revealed to have died in the car crash which occurs during the introduction. The twist is that her <em>daughter</em>, who wasn't supposed to have made it either, is somehow saved by her actions during the main game, despite the fact that none of them actually happened in reality.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pinstripe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pinstripe">Pinstripe</a></em>: Towards the end, it's revealed that Ted and Bo died in a drunk driving accident that's heavily implied to have been Ted's fault.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment">Planescape: Torment</a></em> completely zigzags this the trope. For starters, the main character died multiple times  yet he cannot die the ultimate death, which is the game's goal. The first party companion Morte also died and became a floating skull. And during the game, a small group called <em>Dead Nations</em> consisting of undead skeletons and zombies is encountered, governed by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Silent King</a>. Who is actually dead all along and thus doesn't govern anything.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a></em> features a little girl NPC who asked you to bring a letter to her friend in Ballonlea Town. Her friend turns out to be an old guy who explained he has a sickly girl as friend in the past. Then, when you return to where the little girl was, she's nowhere to be found, but you found a Reaper's Cloth, an item used to evolve certain <em>Ghost</em>-type Pokemon, and a thank-you voice out of nowhere.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype">[PROTOTYPE]</a></em>, it is revealed towards the end of the game that Alex Mercer <em>did</em> die at Penn Station and that the character we play is not Alex Mercer. It is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">The Virus</a> which Mercer released before being killed. The Virus absorbed Mercer's DNA and adopted his memories and came to believe he is Mercer; though the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">viral monster</a> is actually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityIsInfectious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityIsInfectious">less</a></em> of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero">dick</a> than the original Mercer.
</li><li> Both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Stocke</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Heiss</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RadiantHistoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RadiantHistoria">Radiant Historia</a></em>. Both of them died and were brought back from the dead as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TargetedHumanSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TargetedHumanSacrifice">sacrifices</a> for the ritual that holds off the destruction of the continent for a few more years. The only reason Stocke doesn't remember being someone else is because Heiss wiped his memories. Similarly, the Prophet Noah died sometime after withdrawing from public life five years before the start of the game (Possibly murdered, though natural causes is also possible given his age).
