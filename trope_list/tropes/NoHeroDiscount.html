He regularly shells out hundreds or even thousands of lien to maintain and upgrade his weapon, Emerald Gust. Then there's expenses like buying and repairing his clothes, school supplies, food, expenditures for his friends, and making sure he's stocked up on medical supplies and ammo. He <em>does</em> get some help from Weiss and Pyrrha, but he's insistent on not relying on them for his own expenses.

Does the owner who catches them in the act argue? Yes, briefly — but then he does allow himself to be talked into letting them arm themselves to their hearts' content, mostly on the grounds that if the invaders win they'll likely confiscate his property anyway.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia">Paranoia</a></em> plays with this trope; Player Characters are often given elite, unreliable, possibly explosive gear no one should have. They're tasked with testing it on mission and are responsible for returning it safely. This can even be as ridiculous as being required to test a nuclear grenade with a three hundred yard radius <em>and</em> bring the grenade back intact. It helps that Paranoia is a darkly satirical send-up of RPGS and dystopian fiction.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsRoleplayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsRoleplayingGame">Star Wars: Edge of the Empire</a></em> makes a mechanic of this trope; the GM has means of invoking your various debts and using them to push you down the plot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkHeresy">Dark Heresy</a></em> takes this trope into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring">With This Herring</a> territory; you can be an agent of the Inquisition scrounging for the cheapest weapons in the Imperium. Remember, the Inquisition has life-or-death authority over almost anyone in the Imperium.

Since the characters are time travelers, it's assumed they are all very wealthy. The Continuum - the main faction of time travelers, assumes you would use time travel to get whatever you need, including money, so they make allowances. Likewise, you can pull the trick seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BillAndTedsBogusJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BillAndTedsBogusJourney">Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey</a></em> and simply make equipment appear what you need - by accepting an obligation to in your future take the time to set up the thing you need where you need it. So the protagonists literally can have nearly anything they need whenever they need it. The same applies to skills, with one example mentioning a character finding themselves on a crashing hovercraft, hopping back in time, working to set up a chance to learn to pilot hovercraft, learning those lessons, then jumping back to the time of the crash and saving the day.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RogueTrader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RogueTrader">Rogue Trader</a></em> averts it, hard.

If you perform enough heroic acts and get your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">reputation</a> high enough, shop prices start going down (to a maximum of 50% at 20 reputation) as the shopkeepers realize you're probably going to use the ludicrously expensive items for a good purpose (on the opposite side, being evil makes store prices higher). You still sell items for less than a fraction of what they're being sold for, and nobody ever just <em>gives</em> you items no matter your need. This creates a few plots holes, such as Drow (evil underground elf) merchants giving you lower prices based on your heroic deeds on the surface, as well as having to buy items from a priest in an elven city you're currently saving from an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer">Evil Sorcerer</a>.

The Librarian is actually in the employ of Dracula, and only helps Alucard at all as he's a greedy bastard.

As much as Jacob the shop owner would like to give Shanoa what she needs for free, he still has to make a living, and considering the village is in the middle of nowhere with Shanoa being one of his only customers in a time of great unrest due to Dracula's imminent return, he can't afford to give her stuff for free.

<ul><li> There is also the island in 1000 AD where, at first, the Mystics running the shops hate humans and charge far more than the asking price for items and weapons. However, completing a sidequest in 600 AD will improve the Mystics' attitude about humans, and the shops will now give a discount instead.

It's still pretty high but as he (along with some other merchants in the game) will tell you, they are still merchants and need to make a living.
</li><li> The weapon and item shops in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonGaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonGaze">Demon Gaze</a></em> not giving you discounts is one thing, since you're just another mercenary to them. Fran, on the other hand, in depending on you doing jobs only the Gazer can do, but will not discount you a cent. Booking more rooms so you can take more party members? Be prepared to cough up a cool 1000G (and Lorna had to cover the first one just so you wouldn't be flying solo). Fail to pay room and board the moment you step in the door after another life-threatening dungeon dive? She'll <em>blacklist</em> you from all but the most essential services until you settle.

The exception is the first time you're in Hell's Kitchen, where he gives you a discount if you rescue his friend from MJ12.
<ul><li> Furthermore, those characters who suggest you ask someone else for needed items and information - and who are fully aware of the importance of you getting them - can't be bothered to so much as loan you the necessary credits.
</li><li> Occasionally, some of your allies <em>will</em> give you items for free. Other characters will offer you a discount on items for sale in exchange for completing a side quest.

And weapons. And ammo. And information. Considering you are trying to track down a mercenary group that killed half a dozen scientists <em>and</em> are planning some kind of conspiracy that would dramatically change the outlook of the company, you really should have a platinum company credit card that makes credits meaningless.
<ul><li> There's also a LIMB clinic office on Panchaea, where the shop keeper has barricaded herself against the crazed augs. She mentions that she'd <em>like</em> to give you a discount but the whole thing is based off a computer she can't change, so you're still charged full price for medicine, Typhoon ammo, and upgrade kits.
</li><li> Averted in the case of Seurat, an arms dealer in Detroit. If you rescued Greg and Josie Thorpe during the factory mission, he will give you "the egghead discount" any time you visit him for the rest of the game.
</li><li> In <em>The Missing Link</em>, Quinn (the only merchant) defends charging you for goods by reminding Jensen that he's a fugitive in the facility they're both in, so he's taking a tremendous risk doing business with him. However, if you saved a person earlier, he does give you a discount.
</li><li> In general you're presumably on an expense account, you presumably can file the associated report and be reimbursed when the main plot is over. For the really expensive stuff (such as getting access to Heng Sha) your company <em>does</em> provide, which turns out to be a whole new problem - and makes the advantages of using money and equipment which can't be traced to your employer clear.

He's an <em>angel</em>! What's he going to do with the money? Build ornate churches?
<ul><li> In regard to the Merchants of Light accompanying Tyrael, additional information at Battle.net gives a reason for why they charge you for weapons and armor despite being at Hell's doorstep. Like Tyrael, they are forbidden to help you directly. Selling and buying equipment <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">is a way for them to work around it</a>, because it qualifies as indirect help at best.
<ul><li> From the game's Web site:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><em>In Act IV, Tyrael will resurrect your Hireling but he will charge you. What does he do with that gold? Angels got to pay the bills too.</em>
</div></li><li> Partially averted in Act 2 where, as a reward for defeating Radamant and avenging her family's death, the owner of the local tavern convinces the rest of the merchants to give you a discount on all wares. A discount, mind you, not free goods.
</li><li> Larzuk seems to be aware of this trope in <em>Lord of Destruction</em>, saying that your gold isn't lining his pockets; it's paying for the armour, weapons and medical supplies of a city that is under siege by the forces of Hell.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a></em> game averts this trope to a degree, on the fact that nobody is expecting you to succeed. If the merchants gave free goods to every would be hero that tried to save the world, they'd have gone broke long before you showed up. This logic begins to fade after you've gone far past what anybody else has accomplished, and everybody starts believing that you are the real deal, but still charge you full price.
</li><li> Sometimes, merchants will give you a discount as a quest reward. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing">Not that it really matters</a>.

The only time this is averted is with one merchant in Denerim, and then only if you played a certain origin story.
<ul><li> Oh it's far worse than that, your camp merchant will promise you a discount, but is actually one of the worst merchants in the game! He buys lower than average and sells higher. The worst part? He's right there in your camp, so invariably you'll sell him most of your loot for convenience's sake!
</li></ul></li><li> Somewhat-mocked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX">Dragon Quest IX</a></em>, where after you save Batsureg, the shopkeepers declare that all their wares are yours...but of course you are such a hero that you will still compensate them.
</li><li> Lampshaded just before the last stage of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Forgotten Realms: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateDarkAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateDarkAlliance">Baldurs Gate: Dark Alliance</a> II</em> where the eponymous city is overrun by the undead, and only a makeshift barricade stands between the shopkeeper and a horde of zombies, and the city's Only Hope is for you to storm the villain's citadel. If you complain about the shopkeeper still charging you full price, he points out that he's confident of your success, but if he gave away his goods where would he be after you save the city. Furthermore, you can afford it, so it isn't like he's jeopardizing the city's safety by refusing to just give the items away.
</li><li> Lampshaded and justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EvilIslands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EvilIslands">Evil Islands</a></em>.
<ul><li> In one instance your base of operations is a village where you are praised as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a></em>, but the village merchant is such an infamously stingy bastard he explicitly warns you right away that he will still charge you with all your purchases. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Later all the village money happens to be stolen and he once again clearly refuses to supply the village guards with weapons for free... because they didn't stand for him against brigands</span>.
</li><li> Another time you join some rebels and obtain all the gear from their blacksmith. He actually apologizes for his shameless prices and explains that he has to smuggle the weapons and bribe the officials of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilEmpire">Evil Empire</a>.
</li><li> However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">at the very end of the game, it's subverted; the very last 'merchant' you meet before the final battle will give you anything he has in stock and perform all services for free. He also fights on your side in the final battle, so he has plenty of incentive to make sure you're as tough as can be.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Zigzagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory">MapleStory</a></em>; while <em>you</em> don't get discounts for <em>your</em> heroics, one benefit to belonging to a Guild is that they grant merchant discounts depending on their game ranking. The bigger the guild and the most high-Level players in said guild, the better the discount. Thus, a guild full of heroic players will indeed get a Hero Discount, but this is rendered void if you leave it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ExitFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ExitFate">Exit Fate</a></em>, it's possible to recruit a few people to your army who then set up shops in your castle. Even though they're <em>working for you</em>, they still charge the same prices as every other shopkeeper in the game.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>, being nice to the ghoul bartender gets you a discount on anything he sells, but others are fairly unfriendly towards you, even after you repeatedly save their collective asses.
<ul><li> In Rivet City, there's an unmarked quest involving a city council member and a fellow merchant who accuses him of stealing his council seat. Completing the quest in favor of one will get you a discount from them, but cause the other to raise their prices.
</li><li> This is lampshaded in the <em>Mothership Zeta</em> DLC, when Somah charges you money to repair your equipment despite the two of you having been kidnapped by aliens and fighting for your lives to escape. Somah points out that even if you both do escape, she's as good as dead anyway if she doesn't have any money to survive on in the Wasteland.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> averts this with the addition of faction reputations, as you get a discount from merchants who are associated with a faction that likes you. This mechanic highlights other vendors apparent lack of gratitude though, a particularly notable example is Old Lady Gibson, who runs the junkyard just outside Novac. Despite being tied to Novac and its economy, she isn't marked as being part of the town and won't give you any discounts when you restore the town's salvage industry by clearing out the REPCONN test site during the <em>Come Fly With Me</em> quest, even though she explains she gets all her junk from REPCONN. She will even charge you five hundred caps for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> critical to completing said quest, which is a lot for low level characters, though you can get it for half if your Speech or Barter skills are high enough, or for free with the Lady Killer perk. She is tied for first with the Gun Runners for being the richest vendor in the game, so its hard to ignore her if you want to sell all your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash">Vendor Trash</a>.
<ul><li> The bartender in Goodsprings will give you a discount if you drive away the attack by the Powder Gangers "on account of what you done for us."
</li><li> Cost for repairing items is also completely unaffected by discounts or Barter skill.
</li><li> The Great Khan armory merchant sells at price if you're liked by them. No discount - base price, whether you're buying or selling. This makes her an excellent choice for unloading expensive stuff, since you can trade in for ammunition and other cheap stuff without suffering price attrition.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> zigzags on this trope. There are a few vendors who will give you very good prices based on your affiliations. For example, Tinker Tom will only sell to you if you're a member of the Railroad, but he offers excellent prices because he's also a member of the Railroad and trying to help you out. Unfortunately, he's got rather limited selection. Other vendors won't give you that great of discounts, even shops you've built yourself at your settlements (though the fact that you get a cut of the profits does help offset this).
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> series is quite fond of this trope.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em> sort of subverts this by having the shopkeeper in Bartz's home town give a discount (which is very appreciated when the single revival item in the game costs 1000 gold), but only because it's Bartz's hometown, not because he's a hero.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em> subverts it at Figaro Castle, where the shopkeepers will refuse to charge Edgar (the king) or Sabin (his brother). However, both characters insist on paying, pointing out that the shopkeepers still have to earn a living. (If Edgar is your party leader, they still give you a 50% discount, though.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIIRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIIRemake">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a></em> plays the trope straight before subverting it later.
<ul><li> Being that Cloud Strife is a mercenary ex-SOLDIER who has no reputation within Midgar, this trope is played up for all its worth early on, with shopkeepers refusing to cut him a break even when he's taking on major jobs like clearing out Scrap Boulevard. However, as Cloud's rep builds and sidequests are completed, certain shopkeepers will offer heavily-discounted medical supplies. Vending machines will also offer certain heavily-discounted goods, depending on when the player accesses them.
</li><li> Played with in a sidequest in the Sector 5 slums. After Cloud and Aerith rescue two of the kids from the Leaf Orphanage, the group of children will offer Cloud a quest to kill the "Toad King" (a rare variant of the Hedgehog Pie)... but they lack the money to pay him anything, and he tells them that they can't afford his usual fee. Upon further thought, Cloud agrees to give them "a special discount" and tells them they can pay him three Gil for the work. After the mission is completed, however, the kids will hand over the one piece of treasure they have - the unique Nail Bat weapon, which is worth "much more than" three Gil.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em> contains one exception. If you return to Timber after you're finished there in the main story, you can save a little girl from getting run over by a train, and it earns you a free night at the inn. Played straight for everything else. <em>How much</em> for a train ticket?
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em> right before the battle with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Evrae, which also leads almost directly to a whole gauntlet run of bosses</span>, Rin will <em>still</em> charge you exorbitant prices. When asked why, when you could all die, he replies:
<div class="indent"><strong>Rin</strong>: I have faith in your victory.
</div><ul><li> Also, the shopkeeper O'aka actually would give you a discount, but in his case only if you had donated a large sum of money to him when he was struggling to get his business off the ground. Otherwise, he charges almost double what any other shop would.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2">Final Fantasy X-2</a></em>, O'aka is so in debt to the Al Bhed that he's willing to avert this trope and give you a discount just so he can pay his debt off. In fact, if you help him clear out his entire debt, he'll be so thankful that he'll sell you his stock at a <em>90% discount.</em>
</li><li> While less related to the economy, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em> random people would give you items if you talked to them (this happens much less frequently after you defeat Seymour for the first time, as most of Spira brands your party as traitors), considering you're a summoner and her guardians. It made the stinginess of the shopkeepers more noticeable.
</li></ul></li><li> Handwaved in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIIRevenantWings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIIRevenantWings">Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings</a></em>, where the only vendor in the game actually works for you, purchasing equipment while you're off adventuring. One NPC in the ship points out he must be losing quite the amount of money, as Tomah sells said equipment at only a fraction of the original price.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em>, where all transactions are done via the internet, so vendors are not aware of your status as heroes, but even then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity">as you're characterized by the government as villains for the entirety of the plot</a>, even if they knew your identity, they'd probably not want to sell to you, let alone give a discount. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Another aversion is that the fal'Cie control all technology, and are revealed late in the game to be secretly manipulating you in your quest to destroy them (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICannotSelfTerminate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICannotSelfTerminate">which they desire</a>) but are prevented by their programming from aiding you directly (by lowering prices, presumably). One late game vendor has a message from the fal'Cie wishing you luck, though!</span>
</li><li> Before the final boss battle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LightningReturnsFinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LightningReturnsFinalFantasyXIII">Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII</a></em>, one of Lightning's friends will sell her recovery items and spell synthesis at standard prices. What is he going to do with the money? <strong>It's the end of the world</strong>, and he won't have to repay his suppliers.
</li><li> Watts from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyAdventure">Final Fantasy Adventure</a></em> distills this trope to its essence. He accompanies you through a dungeon to get some silver he needs. Despite the fact that you're accompanying him on <em>his</em> quest so that he can get what he needs without dying, he <em>still</em> charges you full price for more items in the middle of said dungeon. It gets worse. After you finish the dungeon and Watts gets the silver, he goes back to the Dwarf Cave to forge equipment with it. Does he give you any for free? Of course not, he charges you full price for the sword and armor. You even have to get the silver helmet from a <em>different shop</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> can get rather silly about this. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn">Radiant Dawn</a></em> is especially bad near the end. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> All of humanity is frozen in stone by an evil god. The only people still alive are your party, the enemies (brought back to life by the god to stop you) and a group of merchants following you.</span> They STILL don't offer you a discount. The kicker? In a few cutscenes, they outright <strong>give</strong> you the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity+1 Spellbooks</a> they found lying around for free BECAUSE you're the last people alive and you're the only hope for everyone. Not the most consistent of merchants, these guys.
<ul><li> It gets even sillier when you realize that they DID give your army a discount for one chapter earlier in the game, before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">everyone was turned to stone.</span> Why they didn't think to do so again is anyone's guess.
</li><li> Exacerbated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fates</a></em> where members of <em>your own army</em> are running the shops in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PocketDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PocketDimension">My Castle</a> yet still won't give Corrin the stuff for free. However, discounts depends on the current keeper.
</li></ul></li><li> Completely averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freelancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freelancer">Freelancer</a></em>, once you encounter the Order. They give you the best ship in the game at that point for 1100 credits, when other ships are in the hundreds of thousands. Unfortunately, when time comes to trade that ship in to the next best one, you'll notice you <em>can't sell it for a normal ship's price</em> either.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadIsland">Dead Island</a></em>, most of the survivor base areas have vendors who will sell you equipment. Despite the fact that the island has been overrun with zombies (thus making money useless), you constantly perform missions to help them, and the fact that they face certain death if you are killed, the vendors still insist on charging you money for their items
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostOfTsushima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostOfTsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a></em>: The game doesn't feature money at all, with generic "Supplies" being used in place of currency when you purchase weapon and armor upgrades along with other materials like steel and bamboo. In this case, the smiths are gladly working for free to help "the Ghost" fight off the invading Mongols, but they still can't do anything without the proper materials.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon">Harvest Moon</a></em> series, most of the marriageable bachelors and bachelorettes work in the area's shops, which are usually owned by their families. You won't get any kind of discount from their family's store if you marry one of them, <em>even if your spouse is the one running the store</em>. This may be so that people would marry characters they liked, rather than just marrying the person that gives them the biggest discounts. It makes little sense in universe, but a lot of sense when you consider the implications of marrying someone for free cake at the bakery.
<ul><li> Averted, however, in one of its spin-off series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory">Rune Factory</a></em>, you may get free fortune-telling or free bathing from your wife. Not that much, though.
</li><li> In the sequels, your spouse will cook you a free meal every day, and her charging you for goods and services is justified in that they still have to help their own family.
</li></ul></li><li> Somewhat lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HenryHatsworthInThePuzzlingAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HenryHatsworthInThePuzzlingAdventure">Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After beating the final boss, Henry ponders the fact that all the money that he paid Cole went to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> which Cole just tried to use to kill Henry.</span>

<ul><li> This is averted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause3">third</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause4">fourth</a> games. The rebels/Army of Chaos will deliver anything they have to Rico for free, though it takes a little time for them to restock the item afterwards.

In fact, he follows you when you run away <em>just so he can continue to charge you.</em> Still, he's useful before that final battle...

<ul><li> The Lunar Lunch-O-Mat owner from gives you a mere 25% discount for being "the savior of [his] entire species," but it's sort of meaningless because you can't even visit the store until you've saved his entire species. Plus, the undiscounted prices would be things like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalCurrencyException" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalCurrencyException">133 and one-third isotopes</a>, and since you can't have a fraction of an isotope, he's probably lying about the discount. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Or it's, you know, a joke.</a>
</li><li> After you rescue Big Brother Sea <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees">Monkee</a> from the digestive tract of a carnivorous sea-plant, he still charges full price for everything in his store. Well, almost. He gives you a magic air-producing rock for free because he thinks it's worthless, and he refunds your payment for a spooky black lens because he hates it and never wants to see it again. The expensive maps are especially silly, since Little Brother gives you some of them for free.
</li></ul></li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LandsOfLore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LandsOfLore">Lands of Lore</a>: The Throne of Chaos</em>, in which the player starts with a writ identifying him as on official business for the king, which can be presented for free services. However, the writ is stolen, leaving him with no proof that he works for the king and justifying why he must pay for things like everyone else.
</li><li> Exaggerated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lufia2RiseOfTheSinistrals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lufia2RiseOfTheSinistrals">Lufia 2 Rise Of The Sinistrals</a></em> when Tia outright tries to scam Maxim by trying to pay less for slain Jellies than what they're actually worth. When Maxim calls her on this she says it's because her shop is doing very poorly, and Maxim <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">accepts the lowered amount</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaCurseOfTheSinistrals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaCurseOfTheSinistrals">Lufia: Curse of the Sinistrals</a></em>, Tia refuses to give Maxim and the party a discount at her shop, even while she's a party member (she'll leave the party temporarily to run behind the counter, and rejoin once you leave). Her justification is that her shop is doing poorly, which is no surprise given that she's off adventuring with you instead of running her shop.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarTheSilverStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarTheSilverStar">Lunar: The Silver Star</a></em> and its remakes, your old childhood buddy Ramus takes over a shop in Meribia. He initially charges you full price because he's still trying to establish his business, but just before the final battle with the fate of the entire world at stake, he gives you unlimited free items from his store to help out. This ends up being a good PR move, as after you do save the world, word gets around about him helping the Dragonmaster and he brings in more business than ever.
</li><li> In both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MakaiKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MakaiKingdom">Makai Kingdom</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantomBrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantomBrave">Phantom Brave</a></em>, you can have a merchant job class in your party; the higher level the merchant, the better stuff they sell (and possibly at lower prices). Said merchants still need to get stuff from somewhere (some kind of off-screen third party provider, possibly), so they still need money to pay for it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigi">Mario &amp; Luigi</a></em>, shopkeepers are willing to give the Brothers a discount if they have good-looking mustaches (or in Bowser's case in the third game, if he has good-looking horns).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG">Super Mario RPG</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the final dungeon, just before the entrance to the final boss battle against Smithy, <em>The</em> Toad as in Peach's assistant, sets up the area with a save block. He also sets up <em>shop</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntrepidMerchant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntrepidMerchant">to sell you items</a> like mushrooms and revival potions. Note that this Toad is on <em>your</em> side and the fate of the world hangs in the balance on this next fight. Guess the economy's more important than that. Although he does sell them at half price.
</li><li> It gets weird when storming Bowser's Castle in the endgame, where Kamek will still sell Bowser and the others end-game equipment, and to help them afford the prices conjures a block that never runs out of coins, but only gives them one at a time, making it so that you have to strike it <em>over a thousand times</em> to buy everything. And you can carry at most 999 coins, so even if you came prepared you'll still have to jump quite a while.
</li><li> Before that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">Hinopio</a> charges positively extraordinary prices for the luxury of sleeping on a pile of wooden crates. In a volcano. This gets lampshaded in the official strategy guide. (It helps that Hinopio is the only inn in the volcano. It also makes for a great moment when Mario awakens face-down on the very uncomfortable-looking crates.)

<ul><li> You're saving <em>the universe</em>, and you <em>still</em> have to pay for every single thing including Inns, items, and even <em>fortune telling</em> on which places you're supposed to be. How about the fact that Mario was the legendary hero to save the universe foretold 1000 years ago? And of course the things you buy are twice as costly as when you sell them.
</li><li> Bestovius makes reference to this trope, telling Mario that he will not teach him how to flip dimensions for free, and complaining that "heroes always expect everything to be given to them!". It does turn into a subversion if you refuse to pay twice in a row, whereupon he offers to teach it for free just so you can continue on your quest.

<ul><li> Lampshaded in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">the first game</a>, where you can yell at the requisitions officer of the <em>Normandy</em> (and pretty much anyone else who sells equipment during moments of emergency) for charging you for equipment. This turns out to be a justified case, however: the requisitions officer is actually obtaining you items that are not N7 standard issue out of his own pocket. He explains that each time ship docks he sells and buys weapons on his own expense and the more licenses and more money he has, the better he can supply you with. It's also completely justified during one mission; You can berate a shopkeeper about not giving you stuff, but he ALREADY gave a bunch of stuff to the paid security forces that had been protecting him and various others before you arrived, and he has no way of knowing how helpful you'll be anyway.
</li><li> Averted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">the sequel</a>.

On the other hand, you get charged an additional 10% if you buy things through the procurement terminal on the <em>Normandy</em> rather than the shops themselves.

Completing quests for merchants who offer them will increase those merchants' dispositions, which will lead to better prices. The same is also true for completing faction quests and will net you a disposition boost for merchants in that faction. In <em>Morrowind</em> in particular, after completing the main quest, you can mention your status as the world-saving hero in NPC conversations for a guaranteed disposition increase. Despite this, it's still not completely averted since no matter what you do, you'll never get those merchants to give away their stock or even offer you prices below the item's actual value.

<ul><li> Justified in that the multinational was doing everything in its power to hide that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they caused the problems that she's trying to repair in the first place</span>. Why would they do anything that might give away what they're hiding? Even when she takes it over <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">following her father's murder</span>, she still answers to the stockholders and can't pull any resources out of their grip.

The second game somewhat averts this trope: the people who you helped in the first game provide you with free room and board at their inn, and the merchants will give you the items you need to subdue the Elementals for free, but only if you ask at the appropriate time (so they won't just hand you over a brass lamp at any random point just because you asked for it, but if there's a fire elemental rampaging and you explain that you need it to capture it, they'll do so).

Tear recommends that you give discounts to the heroes you hire, even if at a loss sometimes, since it will save you from having to equip them when you go dungeon crawling.

<ul><li> To be fair, they do give you a great gun for free just for showing your skill at target practice. This particular vendors' greed seems to stem from pure laziness, since they will happily accept money you just took from the table right beside them. Also, paying 8000 pesetas for a handgun means it only cost Leon about £25, which means he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">is getting one hell of a good deal</a>.

The shopkeeper in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown">Doomed Hometown</a> won't give a discount for the people who are going to save the world and whom he's known forever. Even "Marble's" charges you full price, even after you are identified as the Chosen's group and directly save the lives of both Chocolat and Cacao, the owners of the shop. This likely stems from the party not wanting to take advantage of people, as said group of impersonators are more than happy to ask for discounts that they actually get.
</li><li> Averted again. Later when you get Regal, the president of a very powerful company — his mere presence in the party gives you a 10% discount on everything you buy and 10% bonus for everything you sell (provided you have his EX Skill "Personal" on). But the name of said skill is "Charisma", meaning it is his charm, not his business connections or anything. As to why a character in tattered prison clothes, messy hair and <em>handcuffs</em> inspires such respect in shopkeepers is left unexplained.
</li><li> There's a similar aversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss">Tales of the Abyss</a></em>: Jade's "Emperor's Best Friend" title gives you a 10% discount buying, and Anise's Katz costume gives a 10% bonus selling. There's also a global economy system by which you reduce the price of goods in each town by doing sidequests that help out the townspeople, and reducing the price of goods in one location affects the price of the same goods in others. For example, since Engeve is stated to grow lots of food, lowering prices there will affect food prices worldwide.
</li></ul></li><li> Played for laughs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfBerseria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfBerseria">Tales of Berseria</a></em>. During the game, you come across a little man in a turtle suit. Turns out, he's part of a traveling merchant group whom are notorious for overpricing their items. Because the main characters in the game is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> at best and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> at worst, it doesn't take long for him to fall in line and lower the prices, despite his constant whining about it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TearsToTiara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TearsToTiara">Tears to Tiara</a></em>, the hero tries to persuade Epona the shopkeeper to give stuff for free, because he is fighting for world peace and everything. She responds by giving a lecture that healthy economy is necessary for world peace, and if she will give stuff for free, it will ruin the economy. Said economic theory is definitely anachronistic.
</li><li> In the Diablo clone <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThroneOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThroneOfDarkness">Throne of Darkness</a></em>, you can rescue a blacksmith who then joins your home base. To improve his inventory, you have to give him found equipment that he can take apart. You can then buy better gear. That's right: you have to <em>give</em> him tons of stuff for free, but he'll <em>charge</em> you money for stuff you want. Note that the game takes place in a shogunate-era Japan overrun by demons and monsters, he works for you (or rather your master), and you <em>saved his life</em>.
</li><li> Lampshaded and averted in the final chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TreasureOfTheRudra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TreasureOfTheRudra">Treasure of the Rudra</a></em> - Cid does give you a discount, but is chewed out because he still charges you at all, claiming he's selling from his personal emergency stash.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XMenLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XMenLegends">X-Men Legends</a> II</em>, Beast and Forge will charge their friends for health, energy and powerups. Pretty mercenary, considering that the X-Men and Brotherhood are using these items to defeat Apocalypse. Justified in that they accept not money, but "tech bits" (little pieces of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> dropped from enemies and destroyed objects), meaning that rather than charging ou for stuff in their inventory, they're building you stuff with raw materials you bring them.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lemegeton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lemegeton">Lemegeton</a></em>. You're not giving gold to Noiva as payment, but rather so she can use the stuff, being the king element and all, as alchemical fuel to create what you need.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DinkSmallwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DinkSmallwood">Dink Smallwood</a></em> mod <em>Attack of the Mutant Veggies</em> the only sword available costs 500 gold pieces <em>and</em> a note of permission from the king. When Dink argues that he should just be <em>given</em> the sword since he's the only one saving their butts from the title ex-foodstuffs, the blacksmith counters that he and his family still have to eat.
</li><li> In <em>Heroine Quest</em>, doing major favors for the shop keepers (rescuing one's child and helping two of them unite with each other) will not get you free stuff, but will get you everything sold at cost instead. It is the Fimblewinter, and people do have to eat.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveJacksonGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveJacksonGames">Steve Jackson</a>'s Sorcery</em>: When the shopkeeper of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstTown">First Town</a> tells you the price for rations, you can choose "Haggle" and your character will tell him that s/he is "the new best hope" for the kingdom. The shopkeeper apologises, but says "I still have to feed my family, whatever happens to the Crown."
</li><li> <em>Like Clockwork</em> plays with this (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainmailBikini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainmailBikini">Chainmail Bikini</a>) right at the start with the smith.
</li><li> Justified and lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Avadon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Avadon">Avadon</a></em>. One question you ask of the Fortress Quartermaster is why you should have to pay for equipment. He's heard it from everyone else, and it's because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeamBenefactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeamBenefactor">Redbeard</a> wants the Hands to be self-sufficient as possible.
</li><li> The Black Market Imps in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PinballQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PinballQuest">Pinball Quest</a></em> charge you full price for better equipment. Justified as they don't care about your quest in the least.
</li><li> The Neptunia series deserves a special mention. In every game, your party contains the very goddesses that rule over the world, and yet you're still forced to buy all of your items and equipment.
</li><li> The first two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeVelocity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeVelocity">Escape Velocity</a></em> games do not give you any actual <em>discounts</em>, although certain missions could give you specific upgrades (usually ones you couldn't get elsewhere, and that were tied to the specific ship you were using at the time and so couldn't be transferred if you wanted to get a new ship), and both games had the explanation that you are technically a freelancing mercenary, so just being allowed to buy and use highly restricted military equipment is a pretty hefty concession already. The third game, <em>Nova</em> allowed for averting by adding titles the character could get, which behind the scenes could be set to reduce outfit costs by a given percentage from worlds controlled by the faction the title was tied to.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShovelKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShovelKnight">Shovel Knight</a></em>. Shovel Knight receives ichor from the Troupple King for free (though he still has to purchase a chalice to hold it). In Plague Knight's campaign "Plague of Shadows", the Troupple King charges Plague Knight a hefty sum for ichor, because he's a villain and therefore needs to pay a "repentance fee". This is actually an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">Gameplay and Story Integration</a>: As Plague Knight you are buying armor upgrades, rather than just refilling your health potions.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em>Lawrence of Aragon</em> after leaving an item shop in the starting town.
<div class="indent"><strong>Lawrence:</strong> No matter what you do for the people, they're never grateful enough to offer a discount.
</div></li><li> A <em>voluntary</em> example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RabiRibi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RabiRibi">Rabi-Ribi</a></em>: shopkeeper Miriam is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HospitalityForHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HospitalityForHeroes">willing to offer her wares to protagonist Erina at no cost</a>, as Miriam is friends with Erina's master Rumi, but Erina insists on paying like everyone else. Miriam still insists on giving her a discount, and will periodically give her items for free anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles">Valkyria Chronicles</a></em> has a variation. Instead of buying better equipment for Squad 7, you pay the R&amp;D fees to develop better equipment, which is then issued to them for no further charge. Let's not ask why one militia squad seems to be directing the entire R&amp;D effort of the nation of Gallia.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder">Fate/Grand Order</a></em>:
<ul><li> Even though the shopkeeper and the protagonist are friends, members of the same organization, and trying to save the world after it's <em>already</em> been destroyed, she still used to raise the price on you for every single goddamn copy of her painting that you bought. (The price was eventually lowered and players got a refund if they'd bought it at the original extortionate prices, though.)
</li><li> During the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateExtra">Fate/EXTRA</a> CCC</em> crossover event, despite the world <em>literally</em> on the brink of destruction, BB refuses to just hand you stuff for free because she needed to take time to sneak everything by the event's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. She then goes onto say you should be grateful you're even able to buy things from her since she did all the hard work of bringing everything together behind the scenes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em>: You have to pay rather hefty amounts of credits to build things at your own personal foundry, in addition to the costs in materials. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">Side material</a> reveals that this is a result of your ship's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialIntelligence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialIntelligence">Cephalon</a> skimming off the top in order to keep the ship maintained, the food stores stocked, and so on. If he didn't do that, your ship would fall apart and you'd starve to death after spending all your money buying a bunch of weapons blueprints off the market.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ghostbusters1990" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ghostbusters1990">Ghostbusters (1990)</a></em> has the weapons shop owner that sells you weapons and shields for very high prices, despite the fact that such tools are practically needed for a Ghostbuster to do their job properly (the Barrier item is the most expensive at $30,000!). Playing normally, you'll never be able to buy every single item unless you deliberately grind money from safes, exit the level, and then repeat. After completing the Castle level however, the weapons shop owner will actually compensate you for that level since he wants to see his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilFormerFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilFormerFriend">Evil Former Friend</a> be put to justice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em> averts this, though in a roundabout way that goes unnoticed. Each game typically has "points", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalCurrencyException" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalCurrencyException">Global Currency Exception</a> that can be used instead of money in some places, and is outright required for certain specialized services. These points aren't actually currency, but represent the quid-pro-quo the Hunter has earned - for example, in <em>Monster Hunter 4</em>, the Hunter can claim services from travelling companions with Caravan Points, said companions explaining they're spotting the cost in return for quest work the Hunter has done.
