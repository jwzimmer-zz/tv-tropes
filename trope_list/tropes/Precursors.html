<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeroicAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeroicAge">Heroic Age</a></em>, the precursors (known as the "Golden Tribe") was the source of many wonders; giving birth to stars, discovering the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel">Star Way</a> which connects all stars, as well uplifting several races. In time they eventually undertook a journey out of their home galaxy and into a new one. The story is about how the lesser races cope with the "Golden Tribe's" absence.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulHunter">Soul Hunter</a></em> manga, five aliens, The First People, came to Earth millions of years ago after their home planet self-destructed. All but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">one</a> merged with the earth and its life forms to spread their blood, leaving behind the first seven paopei (magical weapons used in the series) from which all others would be copied.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LastExile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LastExile">Last Exile</a></em>, this turned out to be the answer to all the mysteries (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot">there were plenty</a>).
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em> series has the Protoculture, who are apparently responsible for everything that happens in the Milky Way: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">humans, Zentradi, and a multitude of other species across the galaxy were all created and seeded by them, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossZero">the Birdman</a> was made by them in an attempt to mimic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier">the Vajra</a>. Moreover, they "created" (it's a bit more complex than that) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7">the Protodeviln</a>, who pushed them to the brink of extinction before being defeated.</span> About the only thing the Protoculture didn't have a hand in creating are the Vajra of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier">Macross Frontier</a></em>, and that's because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Vajra are <em>even older</em>. The Protoculture based some of their most advanced technology (such as Space Folding) after the Vajra's biological systems. The Vajra themselves seem to primarily take a "live and let live" attitude towards other intelligent species; the fact that they don't have a clear means of communication probably has a lot to do with this.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>, the lost civilization of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">Al Hazard/Alhazred</a>, whose artifacts and technologies were considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Logia</a> even back in the era of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Ancient Belka</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheMysteriousCitiesOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheMysteriousCitiesOfGold">The Mysterious Cities of Gold</a></em> the Mu Empire and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis">Atlantis</a> developed highly advanced society and technology but were wiped out, along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">(most of)</a> their technology, by a nuclear war.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>, the First Ancestral Race (FAR) dropped Black and White Eggs (Adams and Liliths) on several planets. No planet was supposed to get more than one Egg, but because we got two, we got the inter-egg wars that compose the series proper (Lilith's children vs. Adam's children). The First Ancestral Race were never mentioned in the show itself, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">but is referred to</a> in the early scripts and gets a bit more fleshed out in the <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion 2</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a> game that served as supplemental material.
<ul><li> A precursor race is vaguely alluded to in episode 21, where Gendo points out to Fuyutsuki that "someone, who was <em>not us</em>" left behind the geofronts found under Antarctica and Japan.
</li><li> What allows them to escape being considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors">neglectful</a> is that they sent a contingency against "inter-egg wars" — the Spear of Longinus, which can best be described as some sort of control rod which deactivates the egg it is attached to. Both Eggs had a Spear but Lilith's was lost on impact; Adam was the first to find Earth, but upon Lilith's unexpected landing, his Spear activated and sealed him; so, technically, everything worked just as expected. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">It's not their fault the Lilim decided to yank Adam's Spear</a>. There's a definite potential for the FAR to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors">Abusive Precursors</a> though. For all they supposedly didn't want the two eggs to mix, the warning they left behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllNeverTellYouWhatImTellingYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllNeverTellYouWhatImTellingYou">contained explicit instructions on how to go about doing it in such a way as to become a nigh-omnipotent cosmic being.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar">Outlaw Star</a></em>, an ancient race is revealed to be responsible for the Galactic Leyline, yet another of the many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hooks</a> in the last episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheVisionOfEscaflowne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheVisionOfEscaflowne">The Vision of Escaflowne</a></em> — The people of Atlantis created fate-altering technology and the "zone of absolute fortune". They were responsible for the creation of the world of Gaea. In the end they were destroyed by the "zone", so it did not quite live up to its name.
</li><li> The as-of-yet unnamed Ancient Kingdom in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> fits this bill. Dating back from the Void Century, they were incredibly powerful, but later fell to the alliance which later became the World Government.

A race's clout in the galactic hierarchy is in part determined by how close they are to having been created directly by the Progenitors. Then along come the Humans, who have reached the stars alone, with no patron race and a complete fossil record that indicates they evolved naturally. It's practically heretical! It doesn't help matters (from the galactic standpoint) that humans have already Uplifted chimps and dolphins, too. <br/><br/>In the second novel set in the Uplift Universe, <em>Startide Rising,</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the first dolphin-captained Earth ship discovers what is assumed to be a fleet of the fabled Progenitors, and must try to return to Earth while being hounded by bickering alien battle fleets after the transmission of their findings is intercepted; the most active (and warlike) of the alien races/alliances are not happy that the wolfling Humans might have the key to the fate of the Progenitors (which could prove most or all of their belief systems wrong</span>.

Several of these, most notably the Xunca, the Tar-Aiym, and the Hur'rikku, had a profound impact on the earlier history of the galaxy and left numerous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum">artifacts</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors">lying around</a> after they variously departed.

As a result, there are many technological paths they never even thought of.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven">Larry Niven</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnownSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnownSpace">Known Space</a></em> universe, there are <em>two</em> sets of precursors. First there were the Thrintun (AKA "Slavers"), who seeded the galaxy with the ingredients of life so it would grow and evolve into unique delicacies for them to eat (being hypnotic slavers, they were defeated by the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tnuctip">Tnuctipun<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the inevitable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters">Turned Against Their Masters</a>, and they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">took all sentient life with them</a>. Talk about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors">bad parenting</a>). Then there were the Pak, a race of more recent aliens with three life stages (child, breeder, Protector) only sentient in the third stage, and programmed to be homicidal to anything that could conceivably threaten their descendants (mutations were not recognized). Earth was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostColony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostColony">Lost Colony</a> of them who couldn't advance to Protector stage when their supply of tree-of-life root ran out due to a lack of thallium in Earth's soil. They left behind lost colonies and random apelike animals all over, including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ringworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ringworld">Ringworld</a>, which they had built and abandoned</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndreNorton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndreNorton">Andre Norton</a>
<ul><li> She wrote a lot of space opera novels featuring relics of various lost civilizations, collectively called "Forerunners". She was one of the early developers of the abandoned-gateway-between-worlds idea that the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse">Stargate</a></em> films and TV series are based on; one of her Forerunner cultures left behind such a network, which younger species, including humans, have started to explore.
</li><li> In her <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WitchWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WitchWorld">Witch World</a></em> fantasy novels, humans migrated to High Hallack centuries ago only to find that the Old Ones had been there before them; these <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors">Neglectful Precursors</a> left behind quite a few ruins and dangerous artifacts.
</li></ul></li><li> Frederik Pohl's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeecheeSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeecheeSaga">Heechee Saga</a></em> set many of the standards for this trope. Humanity has stumbled on an space station abandoned by the local Precursors, the Heechee, and try to use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel">Faster-Than-Light Travel</a> spacecraft left behind to search for alien artifacts to reverse-engineer. The destinations are pre-programmed and can only be accessed randomly, making exploration a dangerous crapshoot. Some of the survivors return rich; many return dead, if they return at all.
</li><li> In the Carl Sagan novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Contact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Contact">Contact</a></em> and the movie based on it, an unknown ancient race of aliens built the "cosmic subway system" of wormhole transportation used to bring a single human to meet the successor aliens who inherited the system.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesSheffield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesSheffield">Charles Sheffield</a>'s Heritage Universe novels, the Builders left behind artifacts the size of <em>planets</em> — e.g. Cocoon, the first such artifact discovered by humans, was so named because that's what it looks like if you're far enough away from the planet it surrounds. A whole discipline of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventurerArchaeologist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventurerArchaeologist">Adventurer Archaeologists</a> exists to study Builder artifacts.
</li><li> In the Strugatsky Brothers' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NoonUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NoonUniverse">Noon Universe</a></em> series, the Wanderers may or may not be still active, but they fit this trope closely enough because the humans only ever find the traces of their continued and enigmatic work. They seem to be "progressing" the other civilisations, but their activities often enough utterly screw over local civilisations, though it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientMoralityLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientMoralityLicense">might be for their ultimate good in some way anyway</a>.

<ul><li> Some elven kingdoms are precursors to the people of Middle-Earth.
</li><li> Númenor and Arnor. Even though Gondor still exists and so Númenórean civilization is not completely gone.However, it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">much reduced</a>, occupying only a small southern corner of Middle-earth. Its northern counterpart Arnor is almost entirely gone, existing only as the Shire and Bree.
</li><li> From the perspective of the modern day, the Elves of Tolkien's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">Middle-Earth</a> are a Precursor race. Humans did not descend from them, but they've been in the world longer than anyone and have <em>really</em> long-lasting artifacts. Gandalf, Thorin, and Bilbo's swords in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em> are all artifacts from Gondolin, a city that was destroyed roughly 6,000 years before the events of the book. Not only are they unrusted and sharp, their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerGlows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerGlows">orc proximity alert</a> is still active.
</li><li> And then there are the Woses, who are implied to be the original humans who built the first civilisations in middle earth.

Witanowski's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheReynardCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheReynardCycle">Reynard Circle</a> three major civilizations have come and gone by the time period of the novels. (Possibly more than three if the fan theory that the series is set long <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a> is ever confirmed.)
<ul><li> The golden skinned Telchines, a matriarchal culture that coexisted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGiantsAreBigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGiantsAreBigger">Giants</a>. The castle of Maleperduys was built by them. Their rule came to an end rather abruptly due to...
</li><li> ...the Demons, who enslaved the world in seven days. They created the Chimera, built functional <em>robots</em>, and would have ruled for an eternity were it not for their apparent inability to get along with each other. A civil war (implied to be nuclear) weakened them to the point that the last of them was slain by the founder of the Kingdom of...
</li><li> Aquilia, a kingdom that eventually splintered into several dozen countries after the last member of the royal family drowned at sea a thousand years prior to the beginning of the saga. They built some truly impressive structures using the technology of the Demons, but seemingly forgot how to use it as the years went by (either that, or the technology stopped working and they had no idea how to fix it.) Duke Nobel claims to be a direct descendant of the royal family, but it's unclear if this is just part of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">public relations policy</a>.

These planet-building (and terraforming) precursors, called "Spindles" due to their great height, had their own set, called "Rollers" who didn't make celestial bodies, but megastructures (their ship is 500,000 miles long). These guys were preceeded by "Paleotechs", whom destroyed stars to make heavy elements (and pretty nebuli). These, in turn, had "ChThons", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhale">Space Whales</a> who exhaled hydrogen and kindled suns.

Humanity is the youngest known race, even though their technology level means they are strong enough to kick everyone else's backsides should the need arise. It helps that most of those races have long ago passed the peak of the civilization. In fact, two of them spent several million years as slaves, degrading their technology to the point where they forgot about their former greatness. <br/><br/>Ironically, the race that is actually known as the Precursors (or Forerunners, as there is no official translation to English) are non-sentient proto-lifeforms which have been created by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings">energy being</a> (supposedly, the first being to ever gain sentience in the universe) to serve as seeds for its copies.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a></em> has several features that are attributed to Precursor-like races. The two most prominent are the Rakata and the Celestials:
<ul><li> The Rakata, who debut in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a></em>, created the first modern hyperdrives, built a vast empire (though it had relatively few planets since their dark side-powered hyperdrives could only travel to worlds with a large Force presence) and created a massive orbital factory called the Star Forge which could build enough materiel to supply their entire empire.
</li><li> The Celestials lived much further in the past, circa 200,000-50,000 BBY. They created Centerpoint Station (a giant repulsor beam that created the Corellian system and is so advanced that a 25,000-year-old Galactic civilization cannot replicate or even understand how it works!) as well as the Hyperspace Triangle that bisects the galaxy (which makes galactic civilization possible), the Maw Cluster of black holes, the hyperspace anomaly that seals off the Unkown Regions and much more. The Rakata and most of the other "younger" precursor races started out as vassals of the Celestials. The Celestials were created by the EU's then-head writer Troy Denning in his novel <em>The Joiner King</em>, and they play a key role in the backstory of Denning's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> that stretched from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarkNestTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarkNestTrilogy">Dark Nest Trilogy</a></em> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateOfTheJedi">Fate of the Jedi</a></em>; Denning also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWelding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWelding">arc welded</a> them to existing elements of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse">The 'Verse</a> such as the aforementioned Centerpoint, which debuted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCorellianTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCorellianTrilogy">The Corellian Trilogy</a></em> a decade earlier.

Much of the magic that made ancient Tevinter so powerful is implied to have been stolen and reverse engineered from elven artifacts, and modern Dalish elves spend most of their time combing through ruins for scraps of history left behind by their ancestors. Interestingly enough, even though they were once immortal and capable of incredible feats of magic (such as creating entirely new species, physically walking in the Fade, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">constructing the Veil between the waking and dreaming worlds</span>), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">ancient elves don't inspire any of the awe that usually accompanies this trope from their human successors</a> — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnslavedElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnslavedElves">probably because their descendants are now scrubbing floors</a>. Another reason is that the other races have their <em>own</em> precursor civilizations to look up to; the setting in general is deep into a dark age that they're only just starting to crawl out of, and everyone is lucky if they can <em>use</em> things like the Imperial Highway and Deep Roads, much less make more.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>:
<ul><li> For all the mortal races, save for possibly the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Argonians</a> (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableCanon">lore is unclear</a>), there is the Ehlnofey. They are the lesser et'Ada ("original spirits") from the creation of Mundus who remained in the mortal realm and populated it, becoming the progenitors of the modern races.
</li><li> After the Ehlnofey, for the races of Mer (Elves), come the Aldmer. They came to Tamriel during the Merethic Era from the now-lost continent of Aldmeris (though other sources say that Aldmeris was another name for Tamriel prior to the emergence of the races of men). Whatever the case, the Altmer are their closest living relatives with the other races of Mer having split off over the ages for various reasons (usually religious in nature).
</li><li> For the races of Men, except for the Redguard and maybe the Nords (again, there is unclear and contradictory lore) it is the Nedes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Septim propaganda</a> claims that they came from the now frozen-over continent of Atmora, though this may have been a lie meant to appeal to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">mighty Nords</a> to make them supportive of the Cyrodiilic empire. Other sources state that they were among the many human tribes native to Tamriel. In either case, they are definitely the precursors of the Imperials and Bretons, with the Nibenese Imperials as their closest living relatives.
</li><li> There were known to be actual migrants from Atmora, known as the Atmorans, who emigrated to Tamriel throughout the 1st Era after Atmora began to experience the "Frost Fall," a gradual complete freeze that would render it uninhabitable. They definitely make up at least part of the ancestry of the Nords.
</li><li> The Dwemer ("Deep Elves or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreDifferent">Dwarves</a>") and the Ayleids ("Wild Elves") were each <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors">Abusive Precursors</a> toward the Falmer ("Snow Elves") and the Nedes, respectively.

The lore states that there was once a race of Men who lived on the continent of Akavir, far to the east of Tamriel. However, they were "devoured" by the Tsaesci and are now gone. While some believe this means they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">literally eaten</a>, another theory posits that this is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue">metaphor</a> for being enslaved and/or culturally absorbed.

We used the EVE wormhole to travel to the Galaxy of New Eden, but when the wormhole collapsed, so to did civilization in New Eden, and as new civilizations formed, their origins faded into myth and legend.
<ul><li> The <em>Apocrypha</em> expansion has given us a glimpse of some of the old technology which the precursor humans left behind: the sleepers. Ancient drone ships guarding long forgotten structures packed with technology that makes the most advanced player ships and weaponry look like we're using BB guns to fight enemies with nukes. The technology that has been scavenged so far has allowed the playerbase to build relatively small cruisers with the firepower and defenses equal to and even beyond battleships. It will be a terrifying day when we can finally build new kinds of battleships with sleeper tech.

In fact, it's said that humans are descendants of Cetra who stopped the search for the Promised Land and chose a life of convenience. Two thousand years ago, the Cetra were nearly wiped out when the alien Jenova started infecting them with a virus which mutated them into monsters. Though the Cetra managed to seal Jenova, their numbers rapidly dwindled. The last known full-blooded Cetra was Ifalna, who was experimented upon by Shinra as they sought for her knowledge of the Planet. Before she died, she fell in love with a human and gave birth to Aerith. Although Aerith is only half-Cetra, she is still able to communicate with the Lifestream, can sense when people die (as they "return to the Planet"), and knows how to summon Holy, the only spell capable of defending the Planet from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">Meteor</a>.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Shivans</a> themselves qualify as Precursors in some respects: while not extinct, their technology is far more advanced than humans' and they've been that advanced for at least 8,000 years.

</li><li> According to the game's expansions, the "Precursors" mentioned above were called the Arnor, and were the same species as the Dread Lords, but were ideologically opposed: the Arnor wanted to guide and look after new intelligent life, while the Dread Lords wanted to exterminate it. It isn't clear what happened to the Arnor after they defeated the Dread Lords, although one survivor is found in the <em>Twilight of the Arnor</em> campaign.
</li><li> There are also the mysterious <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mithrilar, a group of five immortal beings that were precursors to the Arnor and Dread Lords (indeed, they <em>created</em> the Arnor and Dread Lords).

Which makes us the Precursors and the people in the game merely our descendents.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> universe, the Forerunners are very much a precursor race, who believed that they held the "Mantle of Responsibility" for all life in the galaxy. All that's left of them are artifacts such as the titular "Halo" rings. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They purposely destroyed themselves activating the rings as a last resort to prevent a traveling parasite called "The Flood" from consuming all life in the galaxy, but not before leaving measures for the reseeding of life afterwards.</span> Oddly, humans seem to have a unique connection to them — much of Forerunner technology, including the Halos, can only be utilized by humans, and the major Forerunner installation on Earth is located in East Africa, right next to the area where modern humans are believed to have first evolved (since Forerunners were contemporaries of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalMan">Original Man</a>).
<ul><li> In fact, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3">Halo 3</a></em> terminals reveal that this connection was because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the high-ranking Forerunner known as "The Librarian" felt that humans would be the rightful "reclaimers" of the Forerunners' legacy.</span> Later, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheForerunnerSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheForerunnerSaga">The Forerunner Saga</a></em> books add a twist to this by revealing that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">most Forerunners felt otherwise, due to a long and bloody war they fought with prehistoric humanity's own highly advanced interstellar empire, which was invading Forerunner space in order to flee the Flood and cleanse infected planets; it ended with the victorious Forerunners completely dismantling all traces of human technology they could find, devolving the survivors into a primitive state (who would quickly (re?)evolve into many of the various hominid species we know about today, including modern humans), and shoving them back to their homeworld of Earth.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4">Halo 4</a></em>, we find out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">at least one Forerunner still survives; "The Ur-Didact", the former supreme commander of the Forerunner military, who also happens to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a></span>. The game also provide evidence, namely a speech given by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Ur-Didact in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a>, that there are many more Forerunners living outside of the galaxy</span>, which was confirmed by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the audio epilogue to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloSilentium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloSilentium">Halo: Silentium</a></em>.</span>
</li><li> The Forerunners believed that they inherited the Mantle from a long-gone race of even more advanced beings they called "The Precursors", who are revealed in the Forerunner Saga <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to have played a major role in the creation of both the Forerunners and humanity, among many other species. They ended up being almost completely annihilated when they tried to wipe out the Forerunners for being unworthy of the Mantle. Most of the survivors turned themselves into powder with the plan of eventually re-constituting their original forms, but they all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">Came Back Wrong</a> and became the <em>Flood</em>. They then apparently decided to eliminate the Forerunners, "unite" all life in the galaxy, and test whether humanity was worthy of the Mantle... or maybe they just wanted their creations to suffer for all eternity. Either way, their technology (which seems to have been made of <em>thought</em>) was completely destroyed when the Halos (the only things capable of destroying Precursor relics) were fired. The prisoner of Charum Hakkor, a scorpion-like creature with 4 arms and an impossibly ugly face, was a Precursor-turned-Flood-Gravemind, while the Forerunner Domain, an immaterial and self-aware galaxy-wide information network, is revealed to be one of their many creations. They themselves were not bound to any form, being able to assume an infinite amount of forms, physical and incorporeal, had minds that transcended realms and dimensions, they created entire realms and dimensions and they are potentially older than the actual universe itself.</span>

They weren't around to see that the Scourge, while a destructive and possibly permanent presence in Heleus, was not fatal to the angara and they continue to survive on multiple worlds despite the hostile invasion of the Kett.

Their true agenda is never entirely revealed but there are hints that they had a specific outcome in mind for most of their worlds, before the Creators and the Kreegan interfered. And between <em>VI</em>, <em>VII</em> and <em>VIII</em>, it was established that whatever their original agenda was, their <em>current</em> goal is 'Stop the Kreegans'. The settings of the games (and the novels) just happen to be in the galactic arm that was cut off from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork">Gateweb</a>, and the Ancients are a bit too busy with the Kreegan to bother restoring it (especially as the cause of the breach was Kreegan infiltration of the gate network).
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myst">Myst</a></em> series of games gradually reveals that the long-lost civilization of D'ni was actually located on Earth; its founders originally <em>came from</em> an alternate universe, but they founded a city <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheEarth">Beneath the Earth</a>. However, the D'ni are not the ancestors of humans; the existence of a nearly identical race on the surface appears to be pure coincidence (although the Earth was specifically chosen because it was known to be hospitable to our kind of life).

Of course, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Towers keeping the environment in its status quo means removing any factor that could be a detriment.

It's just that soul science is a very flexible science with lots of applications in the setting). The Glanfathan culture is based around protecting these ancient sites, a task supposedly given to their ancestors by the ancient Engwithans, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> presumably to prevent anyone from discovering the origin of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe">gods</a>.</span>

In fact, it is but one of at least six and the only one still remaining. One of them went horribly wrong and wiped out the Progenitor civilization. You meet the descendants of the survivors of that race (whose degraded tech is still better than humans'), who have split into two ideological factions. Their crashed escape pods arrive with spider-like mechs that remain from the old Progenitor civilization. Unlike every other unit, they never heal damage, as that knowledge is lost.

They discovered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace">The Shroud</a>, and discovered they could use it for transportation, draw upon it for power, and gain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> powers by living in it. Eventually however, it was discovered that to fuel manipulating the Shroud like that, they made the galactic core black hole bigger to the point where it threatened to annihilate the entire galaxy. The Saviors thought this was a good reason to not do it, while the Divine didn't care. The resultant civil war raged on for an untold number of years, with the Saviors more numerous and the Divine more powerful, the resultant conflict leading to the rise of the gods and monsters of the Shroud. Eventually, a Savior discovered that they could render themselves down into dust containing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerSource" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerSource">all the psi power a Zroni</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmuletOfConcentratedAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmuletOfConcentratedAwesome">could express in its lifetime</a>. The conflict was then resolved by all but one of the Saviors rending themselves down into Zro dust for the single remaining one to consume and unleash sufficient power to wipe out the Divine, leaving the Zroni extinct and trace amounts of the highly addictive dust scattered across the galaxy.

The oldest race around, the Gatekeepers, are only a million years old. Quite old, to be sure, but young compared to the galaxy. As Petey put it, "If it's this easy to be immortal, where are all the adults?" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They were all wiped out due to a variety of reasons over the eons, top of the list being the long-gun, a weapon that can fire anywhere in the galaxy from anywhere in the galaxy as long as you have targeting coordinates. The few survivors of these eras went completely off the grid, hiding their stars in massive superstructures or constructing spaceships the size of planets and running dark.

It worked for a while, and the current galactic civilization has lasted longer than most previous ones, but eventually the Gatekeeper stranglehold was broken and things continued on the same path as before. It eventually turned out that many, perhaps even most, of them weren't wiped out at all; all civilizations reach a point where immortality is easy and it's just safer in the long term to move your entire civilization into gas-giant sized spaceships and go dark beyond the galactic rim. Once the galaxy figured out how to detect them they discovered that there's so many of those ships that by conservative estimates surviving precursors outnumber what they had thought was the population of the galaxy by <em>fifteen orders of magnitude</em></span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Outsider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Outsider">Outsider</a></em>: Several ancient empires rose and fell over the history of local space, impacting its development to various degrees. They are discussed in the side blog <a class="urllink" href="https://www.well-of-souls.com/outsider/precursors.html">at some length<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> The earliest know civilization was active sixteen million years ago, and is known only from a large number of worlds bearing extensive cratering and having undergone mass extinctions at that time. Modern scholars believe this to be the testament of a devastating war between otherwise unknown powers, but nothing's known for sure.
</li><li> The Fenrias civilization arose long after these conflicts, but still over a million years back. It spread through local space and either subjugated or ignored the primitive ancestors of the modern sapient species. The Fenrias split into multiple factions early on and warred extensively against each other, eventually diverging into numerous distinct breeds. Two modern-day species, the Delrias and Morat, are descended from Fenrias populations that survived the fall of their empires.
</li><li> The Dreiman were small — lapdog-sized — but highly advanced aliens that arrived about a million years in the past from outside of local space and quickly wiped out the Fenrias nations, although a few fringe groups held on on the edges of their territory. They rarely settled planets and mostly remained in orbital stations, but engaged in extensive planetary and biological engineering — they seeded and terraformed multiple worlds, many of which remain habitable into the present, and seemingly uplifted many of the local pre-sapient species.
</li><li> Around 500,000 years back, the Dreiman suddenly vanished and the remnant Fenrias nations all collapsed, to be replaced by the Soia. They were more advanced than the Dreiman and, like them, seem to have come from outside known space. They traveled in massive and heavily armed artificial moons that they used to enforce their rule and created numerous genetically engineered species, referred to as the Soia-Liron species; most were hyper-efficient food plants and animals, which are still found on multiple worlds, but at least five sapient species are known from Soia sites and may also have been created in this manner — the ancestors of the modern Barsam, Neridi and Loroi and two now-extinct species. The Soia are thus believed to have been a multi-species civilization, although whether these species were naturally occurring ones from a single world, artificially created or a mix of both, as well as wether any of these were the "true" Soia, isn't really clear. The Soia empire collapsed 275,000 years ago, seemingly in a devastating conflict that subjected every settled planet to devastating orbital bombardment and caused every sapient species to regress to the stone ages — galactic civilization is technically still climbing out of these dark age.

<ul><li> <em>Homo erectus</em>. They inhabited Africa and most of Eurasia for over 2 million years, and are believed to be the first species of human, and the first in Earth's history to make complex hunting tools, control fire and cook their food, and (it's debated) to have symbolic customs, such as burial rites. They were so widespread that they gave rise to many different subspecies of humans, including <em>Homo heidelbergensis</em>, the ancestor of both modern humans and Neanderthals. There are ongoing debates about whether some known groups of early humans are actually <em>Homo erectus</em> or a subspecies descended from them.
</li><li> An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a> topic is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis">Atlantis</a>:
<ul><li> It was first recorded by Plato, and may be an allegory he dreamed up to serve his conception of a utopian society by providing it with an enemy. While the Atlantis in Plato's story is explicitly a fiction, the question is whether the idea was original or making use of an existing legend. Another possibility is that the legend of Atlantis grew out of stories about the civilization on Bronze-Age Crete, long before classical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece">Ancient Greece</a>. Another candidate is <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santorini">Santorini,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which was once Thera, an island city-state in the Aegean Sea, very advanced compared to its neighbors, even possessing indoor plumbing, but erased (along with the middle of the island) by a volcanic explosion about 36 centuries ago.
</li><li> Theories on the origins of Atlantis are far ranging and include everything from islands in the Mediterranean to the continents of North and South America. Proponents of the latter theories, however, are not taken seriously because no such civilisation could have existed and left zero trace or record of its existence whatsoever.
</li><li> The story includes a second set of precursors in the ancient predecessor of Athens (in another location in Greece which no longer exists), which embodied all of the traits of Plato's ideal state. After the war between the two ended in victory for Athens, it was also destroyed in the same calamity as Atlantis. Oddly enough no-one ever seems to believe that this culture was real, even though it gets much more focus in the story and the claims about it are much more modest.
</li></ul></li><li> Medieval and Renaissance Europeans often thought of the Roman Empire this way, perceiving Rome as a great, civilized and intellectually superior culture they strived to emulate. The ruins of Roman buildings and infrastructure still dot the countryside to the modern day, and many European towns and cities were built among the ruins of Roman settlements — which, in many cases, were much larger than their Medieval successors and more comparable in size to their modern iterations. The Greeks were held in a similar sort of awe, and Greek and Roman writings were held as a sort of final authority in scientific matters: suggesting that modern people could equal or <em>surpass</em> the Greeks and Romans — "the Ancients", as they were known — in art or science was seen as ridiculous. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventurerArchaeologist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventurerArchaeologist">Adventurer Archaeologists</a> in Central Asia often thought of the various Silk Road Civilizations this way, too. Similarly, the early Iron Age civilizations of Greece, Anatolia and Mesopotamia which emerged after the Bronze Age collapse and subsequent "Dark Ages" viewed their predecessors as such, most notably the awe in which the Hellenic Greeks held the Mycenaeans.
</li><li> The ancient city-state of Teotihuacán played this role for the Mesoamerican civilizations, such as the Aztecs who arose nearly 1,000 years after its fall. It was one of the great powers of its day, dominating several of the nearby Maya cities and its influence covering much of Mesoamerica; it even had what appear to have been apartment buildings. It had considerable influence on the development of most nearby cultures, including the Maya, and was seen as a holy place by the Aztecs, who believed it to be where the world had been created.

</li><li> The mysterious Bronze Age Indus civilization reached levels of technology, health and urbanism not reached again until the Middle Ages (in India) or later. For just a bit of perspective, the ancient city of Mohenjo-Daro had a better sewage system than nearby Karachi does today.
</li><li> Ancient Phoenician-influenced Sardinia could count. They had iron weapons, conquered Italy and southern France, and had huge stone fortresses long before the middle ages. The end of the Sardinian civilization also coincides with an eruption of Vesuvius, plus the geography and political state of the island could match the description.
</li><li> Any ancient state ended up either as this or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">Vestigial Empire</a>. The best examples would be the six "cradles of civilization" where writing, urbanization and features of modern society first developed independently of older civilizations: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mayincatec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mayincatec">Mesoamerica</a>, the central Andes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt">Ancient Egypt</a>, Mesopotamia, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimSimSalabim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimSimSalabim">the Indus River Valley</a> and China.
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/HinduMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/HinduMythology">Hindu Mythology</a>, there were several lengthy ages before the current age, the Kali Yuga: the Satya Yuga, the Treta Yuga, and the Dvapara Yuga, each one being shorter than the previous era. Humanity begun in the Satya Yuga as being very devout and righteous under the rule of the gods, before declining in subsequent ages, and then starting over at the distant end of the Kali Yuga. Among the technology used during the previous ages included the vimana, a flying palace or chariot used by powerful beings such as Ravana.
<ul><li> Likewise, some Buddhist scriptures mention of a primordial king known as Mahāsammata, who was selected by his people as their ruler as there were no others around them. He was succeeded by several dynasties of chakravartins, universal monarchs who utilize treasures such as the 'chakraratnaya' wheel that allows them to travel across the sky to other continents. As the ages progressed, the chakravartins' rule broke down, and humanity declined in morality and lifespan from thousands of years to nearly a hundred.
</li></ul></li><li> Theosophy features Atlantis (Precursor to Egypt and Mayan culture), Hyperborea (North Pole, precursor of europeans and asians), and Lemuria (precursor to the african cultures and the lower castes of india). Later authors like David Icke and Drunvalo Melchizedek added aliens to the mix.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silurian_hypothesis">Silurian hypothesis<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (name inspired by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>), posits that there could have been an industrial civilization on Earth millions of years ago, and how it could be detectable in this era by accounts of chemical and climatological global changes recorded on the rock strata.
