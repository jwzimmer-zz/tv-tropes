</p><p>This can be a source of tension and drama even when the mother is honest because neither the child nor the father can prove it.

If the mother refuses to tell, only men who have actually slept with her can even guess, and speculation tends to run wild.

Because Kail's inline for the throne and having an heir would be beneficial to him, there is a lot of pressure for him to accept the child as his own... but Kail himself knows that it's impossible that he's the boy's father, because he and GÃ¼zel haven't seen each other for years. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out GÃ¼zel had been brainwashed by Kail's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother">Wicked Stepmother</a> Nakia into lying about her child's parentage.

As she loses power, people begin to gossip more and more openly about how they think her son Juda is actually Urhi's son with her; the fact that Juda and Urhi have exactly the same hair color and that Urhi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler">is the person closest to Nakia</a> really don't help matters.</span> It turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Juda really <em>is</em> the king's legitimate son: Urhi is a eunuch and was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">castrated</a> quite a while before he even <em>met</em> Nakia.</span>

There were enough witnesses that everyone is fairly confident that the female lead, Melida, wasn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwitchedAtBirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwitchedAtBirth">Switched at Birth</a>, but they are far less confident that she is Duke Felgus's daughter since most people believe a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggleBornOfMages" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggleBornOfMages">Muggle Born of Mages</a> to be impossible for a ducal house. It is widely agreed that it is far more likely that her wealthy but commoner mother had an affair with another commoner. Since Melida's mother, Melnoa, passed away some time ago, she is no longer available for anyone to ask, leaving Melida's family stuck investigating all of Melnoa's male friends and deciding whether or not to give up and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring">kill Melida</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em>, while a young Tohru is at her father's funeral, some relatives speculate that Katsuya Honda wasn't really her father, and that her mother Kyouko just had an affair. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">To her face</a>.

</li><li> The female shogun Yoshimune from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ooku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ooku">Ooku</a></em> invokes this trope in pondering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">what a patriarchal Japan would look like</a>. She thinks that matriarchy has a distinct advantage because of it. This may influence Yoshimune's later choices in how to handle her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalHarem">Royal Harem</a>: she spends equal time each week with her primary male concubines, interspersed with one-night-stands with servants. Thus, when she becomes pregnant, none of them can argue when she names the most malleable candidate as the father.
</li><li> In one story of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Tomie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Tomie">Tomie</a></em>, the baby of a family grows up to be a creepy child version of Tomie, who naturally resembles and acts like no one in the family. The father accuses the mother of having an affair because of this, especially when he finds out that a wealthier family apparently has a child who looks the same. The mother, meanwhile, maintains that the child is his and that she did look like him when she was an infant. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Actually, there are several child Tomie's running around because a creepy guy injected the babies with Tomie's blood.</span>
</li><li> Inverted on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NarutoGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NarutoGaiden">Gaiden</a></em> sequel mini-series with Sasuke's daughter, Sarada. She greatly resembles her father plus glasses, but when she asks her mother <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sakura</span> (who doesn't wear glasses) if her father wore glasses too (he doesn't), she acts very evasively of the question. Sarada then questions her mother of even being married to her father; logically, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sakura</span> doesn't take it very well and has a rage-fit, allowing Sarada to discover a picture of Karin (who does wear glasses) with her father. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And then it turns out that Sakura <strong>is</strong> Sarada's biological mother; the supposed "evidence" saying that Karin was the girl's mom was actually badly-handled by Karin's friend Suigetsu since Karin was Sakura's midwife and some DNA of <em>both</em> women got mixed up. The evidence was actually Sarada's dried umbilical cord, which Sakura gave to Karin as a gift for delivering Sarada. Suigetsu mistakenly THOUGHT the umbilical cord came from Karin. The cord's DNA matched with Sarada's because it came from Sakura.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YumeNoShizukuKinNoTorikago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YumeNoShizukuKinNoTorikago">Yume No Shizuku Kin No Torikago</a></em>, Hurrem frequently sleeps with Suleiman as his concubine, but ends up sleeping with Ibrahim once. When the news of her pregnancy becomes known, Hurrem and Ibrahim separately wonder if the baby's father is Ibrahim or Suleiman. Nothing is stated outright, though Ibrahim's worry remains for a long time.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACruelGodReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACruelGodReigns">A Cruel God Reigns</a></em>, Greg believes his first wife, Lilya, cheated on him and that Matt is not his son.

<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildBallads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildBallads">Child Ballad</a> <em>Gil Brenton</em>, the hero accepts the heroine's story of how he got her pregnant, but the ballad ends with magical writing on the baby's body affirming that he is in fact the father, to doubly avert this trope.
</li><li> The Basque ballad <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pello_Joxepe">Pello Joxepe<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> tells of a man refusing to acknowledge his son as such.
</li><li> The Song of Dermot and the Earl, an Irish poem in Anglo-Norman, mentions offhand of one family: <em>Li un ert fiz, li altre pere, Solum le dit de la mere.</em> ("The one was son, the other father; according to the word of the mother.")

Buffy Saint-Maire and Debra Cowan both sang versions of it. The song tells of a girl who wants to marry, but all of the young men who propose to her turn out to be her father's bastard sons. In the end, she goes to her mother in despair, and her mother sets her straight:
<div class="indent">My mother said Â“If your father knew,

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SavageDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SavageDragon">Savage Dragon</a></em>, Dragon's then-girlfriend was pregnant. Since she was a past prostitute and there was a subplot at the time indicating that she might've been cheating on him (she wasn't), the first words out of his mouth were "Is it mine?", which upset her a great deal. He ended up apologizing, she ended up forgiving him, and the baby ended up being his, leading to the boy becoming a hero years down the line.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em>, Laurie is aware that her mother's husband is not her father, but her guess at the actual father is off, and when she finally realizes the truth, she's shocked and horrified.

Not even a suspect." Downplayed in that Oracle accepts his word for it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>, when Peter learns that his deceased lover Gwen Stacy had twin children who have reached adulthood in less than a decade, he soon realises that the children believe him to be their father, but is able to confirm that this can't be the case; downplayed with the revelation that Mary Jane actually knew about the children long before Peter did and never mentioned it to avoid tarnishing Gwen's memory.

<div class="indent">The blonde discovers she's pregnant and goes to confront her husband: "Are you sure it is mine?"
</div></li><li> A pregnant woman complains that her husband keeps minimizing the discomfort and pain of childbirth until the doctor explains that they have a machine that will transmit all the sensations to the father. They do so right through the delivery but the husband shrugs it off saying it doesn't hurt at all. They started the machine at setting #1 and kept increasing it until it was at #10 but he felt nothing. They return home with the baby to find out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatingWithTheMilkman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatingWithTheMilkman">their mailman had dropped dead right on their street</a>.

Having gotten a new bike from his dad and new baseball mitt from his mom, he decided to try it out on the milkman... who swiftly embraced the boy shouting "Son!"
</li><li> A young man keeps meeting young women and wanting to marry them, only to have his father confess to being unfaithful and the woman being the young man's sister. Finally, despairing, he confesses to his mother, who tells him that while his father was being so unfaithful, she got lonely, meaning that he could marry any of them. (Lots of variations, including some where it's a young woman who wants to marry.)
</li><li> A middle-aged couple had two beautiful daughters but always talked about having a son. They decided to try one last time for the son they always wanted. The wife got pregnant and delivered a healthy baby boy. The joyful father rushed to the nursery to see his new son. He was horrified at the ugliest child he had ever seen. He told his wife "There's no way I could be the father of this baby. Have you been fooling around behind my back?" The wife smiled sweetly and replied: "No, not this time."
</li><li> A variation is about an elderly couple who has had 8 (sometimes 12 or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirteenIsUnlucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirteenIsUnlucky">13</a>) children: all of them brown-haired except for one lone redhead. The wife is on her deathbed and calls for her husband, for she wants to confess something to him. The husband comes, and tell her that he assumes it's about the redheaded boy he always suspected wasn't his. "Oh no!" the wife says "<em>That one</em> is yours, it's about the others."
</li><li> A farmer's son had, after his tradition, asked his father for permission to marry one particular girl. When the father heard the name of this girl, he made it clear that he didn't want his son to marry her, because it turned out <em>he</em> was her father. This shocked the son, and he went straight to his mother with the problem. The mother scoffed and said: "Just marry the girl, son. You see: my husband is <em>not</em> your father."
</li><li> There is a joke when a paternity case is brought to the court, but the suspected father refuses to provide a DNA sample, so <em>his</em> parents submit theirs. It tests positive... but only for the granny.
</li><li> An impoverished aristocrat resigns himself to organizing guided tours of his ancestral castle. One day, he notices one of the tourists bears a striking resemblance to himself. He goes up to him and asks "I can't help but notice you look very similar... Did your parents work here by any chance?" "Yes, they did." "Ah, yes, my father was something of a skirt-chaser... Your mother was a chambermaid, no doubt?" "No, I never knew my mother, but my father was a stablehand."
</li><li> What's the sorrow of the baron's stablehand? "My father is a baron, my son is a baron, and yet I have to work in these stinky stables!"
</li><li> A king has three sons, but while two of them are strong, handsome and brave, the third is sickly, weak, plain and timid. The king is tormented by the thought that his wife may have cheated on him throughout his entire life, until finally, on his deathbed, he has the queen brought to him. "My love," he says, "I am old now, and dying, and can forgive almost any sin against me. But there is one I could not. But I must know. My third son. So unlike the other two. Is he truly mine?" To which the queen responds, "My love, I could never lie to you on your deathbed. So believe me when I promise you that you are the father of our third son." Finally satisfied, the king breathes his last... and as soon as he has, the queen sighs in relief and says: "Thank <em>Christ</em> he didn't ask about the other two."

<ul><li> There is a succession struggle after the current king's death due to this trope (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His wife Cersei having indulged in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twincest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twincest">Twincest</a> but nonetheless claiming the children are her husband's</span>).

</li><li> Inverted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard">Jon Snow</a>. His father, Lord Eddard Stark, raises and loves Jon alongside his true-born half-siblings at his home castle in Winterfell, openly presenting Jon as his son and providing him with a highborn upbringing but Jon has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">no idea who his mother is</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">it has not been revealed</a> to Jon, most characters in the series, or to the readers. As a result, a number of characters have provided <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuess">Wild Mass Guesses</a> of their own but none of them line up with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">fanon</a> conjecture, and the sole character who can confirm any of these preductions â€” Howland Reed of Greywater Watch â€” has yet to appear "on-screen." No one in-universe doubts that Jon is Ned's son since the two share the "classic Stark" appearance and personality traits. Jon even looks more like Ned's son than his trueborn sons (who all inherited more of their mother Catelyn's features), which is one of the reasons Catelyn resented Jon so much.
</li><li> Featured in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArchmaesterGyldaynsHistories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArchmaesterGyldaynsHistories">Archmaester Gyldayn's Histories</a></em>, with Rhaenyra's three eldest sons looking nothing like her (likely gay) first husband. Her detractors, the Greens, claim that the boys were fathered by Rhaenyra's lover Ser Harwin Strong.
</li><li> It's also a key feature of the backstory of the Blackfyre pretenders. Daemon Blackfyre claims that the current king Daeron II wasn't the son of the previous King Aegon IV but of Aegon's brother Aemon; therefore, Daemon (the bastard-born but legally legitimized son of Aegon) was the rightful heir. The resulting civil war flared off-and-on for nearly a century. However, the general consensus is that Aegon himself started the rumors of Daeron's supposed illegitimacy out of spite, and to try to build a case for disinheriting him in favor of Daemon.
</li><li> Also during Aegon IV's reign, his cousin Elaena was married to the elderly Ossifer Plumm, who apparently died on their wedding night before or during their consummation (supposedly from the shock of her beauty). Nevertheless, Elaena had a son later on whom she claimed to be Ossifer's, but is widely suspected to have actually been another of Aegon's bastards (and leading to many jokes about how well-endowed Ossifer must have been to have fathered a child from six feet under).
</li><li> During the Dance of the Dragons the town of Tumbleton was taken by the Greens. The Green Ser Jon Roxton claimed Lord Footly's wife Lady Sharis as his prize and killed Footly when they protested. Later a son was born to Sharis who was claimed as Footly's heir but was likely Roxton's.
</li><li> Numerous fan theories revolve around this trope. They range from plausible, if unconfirmed (Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish siring Lysa Arryn's only surviving child; the two did have an affair and Sweetrobin resembles Littlefinger somewhat), to wilder (Elia Martell had an affair with Arthur Dayne; there is little reason to believe this at all) and almost story-breaking (the "Tyrion Targaryen" theory which suggests Tyrion is a product of his mother's rape by the "Mad King" Aerys; considering Tyrion's official father is abusive, this would've been all too convenient for both Tyrion and his horrible father).

The family resemblance, combined with the backstory Lazarus (going under the name "Ted Bronson" at that point) provides, leads his mother Maureen and her father Ira to conclude "Ted" is the illegitimate child of Ira's late brother. Later on, Maureen admits to Lazarus that her father thinks it a good deal more likely that "Ted" is Ira's own son.
<ul><li> Lazarus also mentions that over his centuries of life, he's quite certain he raised children who were not his. He says that he was especially careful to be a loving father to such children.
</li><li> Later in the story, Lazarus is involved in a group marriage, where one of the rules sidesteps this: no matter how long you're involved, any babies born in the meantime means you stick around until they're grown. You may not be the father, or <em>mother</em> but you <strong>will raise the child</strong>.

A male's mating display (raised crest) drives a female crazy, and they proceed to do it anywhere they happen to be at the moment. The concept of family does not exist, and hatchlings are raised (or, to put it better, domesticated) communally by females. Any other time of the year, they don't think about sex at all. The same is true by the other two races conquered by the Race: the Hallessi and the Rabotevs. They are disgusted when they learn that humans mate year-round and form permanent bonds. However, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienCatnip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienCatnip">ginger</a> causes females to temporarily produce pheromones, some members of the Race have also started to have regular sex, and normal male-female friendships evolve into permanent bonds and raise their own hatchlings, although this practice is considered obscene by the majority. On the other hand, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">The Emperor</a> has a harem of females kept away from any other male specifically for the purpose of having an unbroken dynastic line.

Since it's set in 1914, there are no reliable tests, and some characters (Svejk included) believe that a child can have multiple fathers. The funniest example is Svejk's story about a prostitute, who gave birth to non-identical twins with a rather unusual set of birthmarks, eye and hair colours and minor deformities. She sued 16 clients for child support (8 per son) but lost all suits. Svejk comments that she should've picked a single one and hired witnesses to confirm him frequently visiting her.

This is a minor plot point later on when the King feels his firstborn son cannot be King after him since the child was born prematurely and people will be suspicious that he was conceived with the Queen's previous husband.

Vala's husband initially thinks the child is his until one of the Priors (basically, the Ori's prophets) tells him that he's sterile.

So when a woman, called Semele, finds herself pregnant by a guy who says he is Zeus (and he is), Hera (Zeus's wife and yandere extraordinaire) decides to visit the expecting woman in disguise. She tells Semele what boils down to "Oh dear, he can call himself <em>anyone</em>, get him to prove he is Zeus by appearing in his godly form!", and Semele decides she has a point. She gets burnt as a result, and thus is Dionysus/Bacchus born. A later story, told in the play <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Bacchae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Bacchae">Bacchae</a></em>, has people from Semele's city doubting Dionysus's parentage and thus (by that point hard-earned) divinity, which he... does not take well.

<ul><li> In <em>The Science of Adultery</em>, Chapter 4 of his book <em>The Third Chimpanzee</em>, Jared Diamond describes a study conducted on newborn babies and their parents in the obstetrics ward of a hospital that was conducted in the 1940s by a distinguished medical researcher, who disclosed the result to Diamond only decades after the fact and still wished to remain anonymous. Dr. X, as Diamond calls him, was studying the genetics of human blood groups, which are molecules in the blood that people acquire from either their mother or their father. Dr. X merely intended to study how parents passed down these molecules to their children, but accidentally discovered that nearly ten percent of the babies in the study were the fruit of adultery! This is because some of the babies had substances that were not in the blood of either of their ostensible parents and since the samples were taken soon after the baby emerged from its mother, the only explanation was that the father was someone other than the mother's husband. Dr. X withheld the results of his study because such discussion of adultery would have been too explosive in that conservative time, but Diamond writes that later studies in the 1990s using DNA testing variously showed that 5 to 30 percent of American and British babies were adulterously conceived. These results have been challenged more recently by Maarten H.D. Larmuseau, a geneticist at the University of Leuven in Belgium, who points out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiesDamnedLiesAndStatistics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiesDamnedLiesAndStatistics">those DNA studies were biased by focusing on people who had reason to doubt their paternity</a>. By using vast genealogy records and sequencing the Y chromosomes of men in a 2013 study, his team got results for various countries that were less than one percent, leading him to declare that widespread cuckoldry is an urban myth.
<ul><li> It should be noted that Dr. X was testing babies conceived in Britain during the worst years of World War II. ItÂ’s not surprising to find adultery more common in a time when the phrase Â‘eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow you may dieÂ’ had real meaning.
</li></ul></li><li> The use of DNA testing. In about three-quarters of the cases, the purported father finds he is the real father â€”which means, of course, that in a quarter, he finds he's not.

(It was the first of her <em>two</em> appearances on the show, and you can see/hear her say the trope name in this clip here on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/wg6XOqaJQ2k?t=21s">not once<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/wg6XOqaJQ2k?t=2m2s">but twice<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.)
</li><li> In Conn Iggulden's epic stories of the Mongol Empire, a recurring plot-theme concerns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan">Genghis Khan</a>'s uncertainty over the paternity of his eldest son Jechi (at the time of conception, his mother Borte was a prisoner of the Tartars and was known to have been raped). Because he half-believes in the "this is a Tartar's bastard" stories, Genghis repeatedly shuns and blanks his oldest son, or else gives him punitive or seemingly impossible tasks to complete that he would not dream of imposing on the favoured younger sons. This had consequences that stretched down the generations and caused the Mongol empire to collapse prematurely.
</li><li> The whole reason Queen Isabella the I of Castille took the throne of her dead brother Enrique instead of his daughter Juana is due to the uncertainty of Juana's parentage; Enrique was rumoured to be "more interested in his guards than his queen" and the queen had many lovers and even several illegitimate children. DNA tests on their remains have proved otherwise.
</li><li> Isabella's own parentage was seriously contested throughout her childhood, for exactly the same reasons: Juan II of Castille was even more openly gay than his son Enrique. Eventually, though, Isabella grew up to be her father's speaking likeness, which put doubts to rest.
</li><li> At <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneida_Community">the Oneida colony<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the practice of "complex marriage" caused onlookers to wonder about the children knowing their fathers. The leader retorted that the children knew their fathers the way children outside the colony did: on the word of their mothers.
</li><li> Victorian anthropologists hypothesized that matrilineal systems were more primitive than patrilineal systems, stemming from before the organization of marriage so that only a child's mother could be known. This has not been borne out by subsequent researchâ€”but not before it had been imported in many historical novels, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoFistedTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoFistedTales">Two-Fisted Tales</a>.
</li><li> The practice in Egypt of the Pharaoh marrying his own sister was taken to be evidence of the Victorian theory, but since the Pharaoh's heir would be his own son even if he was not born to the sister, it appears to be a matter of regarding only his own sister as his social equal and so an appropriate wife.
<ul><li> Also a matter of getting the strongest royal blood possible for the offspringâ€”the stronger an heir's claim, the less likely a coup becomes, so getting it from both sides helps.
</li><li> This factored into the inheritance snarl around Hatshepsut and the Thutmoses. (Thutmose III was her nephew, and her husband's son, but not her child; her only offspring was a daughter. Thutmose II was her sickly half-brother, to whom she was queen, and who left her regent to his heir when he died young. Thutmose III's reasons for attempting to write her out of history have lately been suspected to be as much about downplaying the fact that he was only royalty on his father's side for his son's benefit as about resentment for the semi-usurpation thing, considering his timing.)
</li></ul></li><li> Researchers in evolutionary psychology have noted that when a young child's resemblance to its parents is brought up in a family setting, it will nearly always be the mother's relatives commenting on the child's resemblance to the father.
</li><li> In some cultures, men may act more paternal to their sister's son than to their (alleged) own, as they can be <em>sure</em> they're related to the nephew in question.
</li><li> Roman law neatly averted this trope, at least in theory; "the father is he to whom marriage points." In other words, legally speaking, biological parentage was irrelevant; the mother's husband was responsible for the child, period. This led to strict enforcement of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGirlIsNotASlut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGirlIsNotASlut">My Girl Is Not a Slut</a>"-style customs, and it was not unknown for a father with a <em>questionable child</em> to exercise his right to kill the infant.
</li><li> Even today, there is a (rebuttable, meaning it can be disproven with DNA testing) legal presumption that the husband of a woman is the father of any child she has. The "psychological parent" doctrine also states that after a child bonds with the man they believe is their biological father, if it turns out to not be the case this man will still be treated legally as their father and have the obligation to pay support, for the child's mental health. Of course, if the man is proven not to be their biological father that may put a crimp in their relationship after that point anyway.
<ul><li> This continues: one of the few cases in which Justice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCourts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCourts">Antonin Scalia</a> has written the opinion of the court is <em>Michael H. v. Gerald D.</em> (1989), which holds that for the purposes of family rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, the "tradition" of recognizing the mother's husband as the legal father of a child trumps any biological arguments unless the state in question has statutory provisions to the contrary. (The case involved a girl proven to be the biological child of the plaintiff; he petitioned for visitation rights, arguing that as the biological father he had a constitutional right to see his daughter, but as California did not at the time provide for visitation rights for the biological father of a child born to a woman married to someone else and who had never been married to him, his petition was denied.) This particular opinion caused a stir in the legal community, and Scalia, although joined in the holding by a majority of justices, was only joined in the whole opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist.
</li><li> One less fortunate case: a woman still married to a man who had been in prison three years got pregnant and wanted to divorce him and marry her boyfriend before the baby was born, but an old law prevented divorce while a woman was pregnant, under the assumption that the baby *had* to be her husband's. That it obviously was not in this case was irrelevant; the baby would still be recognized as his.
</li></ul></li><li> In the 6th book of his <em>Histories</em> (chapters 62-70) Herodotus tells of the problems faced by Demaratos, king of Sparta. When he got the news of his birth, the father, King Ariston, at first suspected that he had been fathered by the mother's first husband because Demaratos was born before ten months had passed since the wedding (for the Greeks, pregnancy lasted ten months) and he had had no children from his first two wives. So he rashly said "this cannot be my son" in the presence of some Ephors. Later he decided that Demaratos was his son after all and after his death, Demaratos succeeded to the throne. However, he got into an intense rivalry with the other king of Sparta, Cleomenes, who then accused Demaratos of not being Ariston's son, used Ariston's rash words as evidence, and called for him to be deposed. Since there was no DNA test then, the Spartans decided to consult the oracle of Delphi, which confirmed Cleomenes' accusation. So Demaratos was no longer king. However it later emerged that Cleomenes had bribed the priestess of Apollo (who was subsequently stripped of her office), and Herodotus notes that Cleomenes himself came to a bad end because of this blasphemy. In some desperation, Demaratos asked his mother if he really was Ariston's son or not. Her answer: in the third night after the wedding, a man came to her who looked just like Ariston, who slept with her, left wreaths with her and left. And then Ariston came and was surprised to see her wearing the wreaths. So it must have been a god who had taken Ariston's shape. (The wreaths turned out to have come from the temple of the heros (demigod) Astrabakos). So Demaratos' father was either Ariston or a god.
</li><li> Inverted by DNA testing in one case, where a woman was seeking benefits for her children. DNA could prove her boyfriend was the father but indicated that another woman was the mother â€” something that made no sense to the woman nor her doctors. Eventually, it was discovered she was a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(genetics)">chimera<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> â€” her reproductive organs had different DNA than the rest of her.
</li><li> This trope is one reason why, in some times and places in history, it was considered perfectly acceptable for a man to be unfaithful on his wife and have mistresses, but if a woman cheated on her husband, she was evil, vile, wicked, a demon, a witch, a whore, etc, etc and could face serious punishment.
</li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfTheRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfTheRoses">Wars of the Roses</a>, accusations of illegitimacy were often invoked by many factions to claim the throne.
<ul><li> Warwick the Kingmaker was a serial offender. He pulled this trick once with Margaret d'Anjou saying that Henry VI was illegitimate (which might have been true). When he and Edward IV fell out, he came up with Plan B, saying that Edward IV's mother Cecily Neville (his aunt!) committed adultery and that the King was an illegitimate child of an affair with an archer called Blaybourne. Later, George Clarence (Cecily's third son!) stated that while Edward IV his elder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleDeniability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleDeniability">brother was illegitimate, he was totally legitimate</a>.
</li><li> Averted with Richard III. He never denied that the Princes were the King's children but used a document and legal precedent to point out that the King's marriage to the Woodvilles was invalid because of a prior engagement on the part of the King. Back then, an engagement was good as a marriage, and invalidated future marriages, thus leaving both Princes illegitimate.
</li><li> To add the complication <em>further</em>, the discovery of Richard III's remains and the DNA test of his body revealed there is a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-30281333">false paternity somewhere in the royal lineage<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The scientists used the living descendants from the royal family (from the Somerset and Richard's sister in particular) matched Richard III's maternal DNA, but not the paternal. But where the false paternity occurred still remains unknown.
</li></ul></li><li> Some female mammals, such as lions, chimpanzees, and rats, tend to mate promiscuously within their social group, many more times and with many more partners than is necessary for conception. This may be a countermeasure to prevent infanticide by the males of the same group, as a male which has mated with any particular mother can't be sure her offspring <em>aren't</em> his.
</li><li> One of the many tragedies of American slavery in the antebellum era was that slave lineages were traced through the mothers' bloodline onlyâ€”<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">because that's how livestock pedigrees are recorded</a>.
</li><li> Some evolutionary psychologists theorize that this is one reason why women bond easily with young infants while men have an easier time bonding after a year or two... when the child has matured enough that family resemblances become obvious and the man is better-assured that it is biologically his.
</li><li> When Grover Cleveland was first running for President, his opponents discovered that he was paying child support to Maria Crofts Halpin, who had had a son out of wedlock. However, Halpin had been involved with several other men at the time, and it was unclear whether Cleveland was actually the father. He paid child support only because among them Cleveland was the only one unmarried.
</li><li> There's an old saying that goes, "You can't always be sure who your father is. You at least know who your mother is."<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2m46n');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2m46n" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2m46n');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">when you think about it</a>, doesn't really make a lot of sense since only the mother can be absolutely sure. Since people don't retain clear memories from infancy, oblivious adoption is always a possibility.</span> In Spanish, there's a similarly-themed saying that goes "Los hijos de mis hijas, nietos mÃ­os son; los de mis hijos, no sÃ© si son", which translates to something like "My daughters' children are my grandchildren; those of my sons', I can't be sure."
</li><li> In <em>The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State</em>, Friedrich Engels claimed this trope was the root of misogyny and the rise of the patriarch, as a mechanism to secure the inheritance of property. He based this primarily on the work of Lewis H. Morgan, whose anthropological evidence suggested the earliest human societies were communal matrilineal clans. Since he was the second-in-command of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx">Karl Marx</a>, his ideas and those of Morgan's by proxy were closely associated with communism and effectively dismissed throughout the twentieth century, although recent evidence has shown that there may actually be truth to early matrilineal clan structure after all.
</li><li> Norway has a tradition for writing books on local history, telling of specific farms and the families connected to them. In one particular case, the authors were <em>very thorough</em> on everybody who ever was registered as living in their home area, but this area went batshit when the same authors insisted on using the term "written father"â€”that is, the father registered in the clerical records. In some cases, the "written father" was, of course, not the real one, and the term cast doubts over a lot of people and their heritage.
</li><li> It was rumored for years that the youngest child of Franz Josef I of Austria-Hungary and his wife Elisabeth/Sisi, Marie Valerie, wasn't actually Franz's daughter but the child of Sisi's close friend and admirer Gyula AndrÃ¡ssy, the Hungarian Prime Minister. Since Valerie grew up to be very physically similar to Franz, the rumors went away with time; Valerie herself, however, was traumatized by them and ended up disliking anything Hungarian.
</li><li> In 1970, scandal erupted in Hollywood after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PattyDuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PattyDuke">Patty Duke</a> revealed that she was pregnant while she was romantically linked with <em>three</em> men: Michael Tell, Desi Arnaz, Jr., and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnAstin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnAstin">John Astin</a>, who she ended up marrying and would adopt her son, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanAstin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanAstin">Sean Astin</a>. Patty long believed Desi Arnaz was Sean's biological father, but in the 90s, Sean took a blood test proving that Michael Tell had been his biological father. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasTwoMommies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasTwoMommies">he still thinks of all three men, along with her final husband Michael Pearce, as his fathers</a>.
</li><li> DNA testing companies that allow people to find out their ancestry (23andme, Ancestry.com, etc.) have had enough people find out that their father isn't biologically related to them that 23andme issues a warning about it: "Unexpected relationships may be identified that could affect you and your family."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BBKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BBKing">B.B. King</a> had at least fifteen acknowledged children throughout his lifetime, although both of his marriages were childless. When writing his autobiography, his ghostwriter discovered King had been informed he would most likely never be able to father children. King took it rather philosophically, and never did anything to suggest the children were not his.
