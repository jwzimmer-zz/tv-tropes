Then again, they don't <em>want</em> to be up front, because they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">squishy as hell</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMedicFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMedicFirst">everyone's gunning for them</a>. This is usually not a problem when one player's controlling an entire party, but this starts to break down in cases where one guy's playing the support. While some are perfectly fine with this (being the medic means you'll get invited to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou">just about any party</a>), for others, the support classes just aren't that exciting.
</p><p>The solution? Give <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">The Medic</a> some teeth, and you've got yourself a Combat Medic.
</p><p>While a Combat Medic still serves as the primary healer and buffer, they have the ability and incentive to leap into the trenches and kick some ass, too. This can be accomplished in a number of ways, including 'protective auras' that buff nearby allies while the medic fights, or attacks that simultaneously heal the medic's allies. Enemies that try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMedicFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMedicFirst">Shoot the Medic First</a> will find that they won't go down as easy as they expected when they can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior">create impenetrable</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeKindOfForceField" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeKindOfForceField">force fields</a> or just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchedAcrossTheRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchedAcrossTheRoom">swat them into the stratosphere</a>. Last but not least, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint">certain tactics</a> can make their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalHarmlessPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalHarmlessPowers">harmless powers lethal</a>, like casting revive on enemies when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReviveKillsZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReviveKillsZombie">Revive Kills Zombie</a>.

After all, in an action series, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist">Hippocratic Oath</a> is a rather overrated thing, and the Geneva Convention is simply quaint and obsolete.
</p><p>The Combat Medic may also overlap with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk">Bare-Fisted Monk</a>, or a monk wielding a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist">Power Fist</a>. Some games do in fact give the monk limited healing capabilities, or a few self-heals. This is linked to Shaolin Monks knowing Martial arts and the term "monk" often being synonymous with a religious figure. Since religious figures almost <em>always</em> are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">Healers</a>, this explains why it is often used.
</p><p>Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePaladin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePaladin">The Paladin</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a> is rather similar, though defense-oriented Magic Knights tend to be focused on fighting first and healing second. Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedMage">The Red Mage</a>, a mage who knows healing <em>and</em> attack magic. Another RPG fantasy class that greatly resembles this is the cleric, who is usually a religious warrior healer. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetitiveBalance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetitiveBalance">laws of balance</a> must also state that a pure healer would have to outclass them in healing and that a Combat Medic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Paladin</a> or a monk that can heal has to sacrifice some common healing traits to be able to take a few hits. But this only really applies when you have a group-oriented game, especially an MMORPG, because why would you roll a squishy-healer when you can roll a Combat Medic that can take a few hits and heal just as good either way? In a solo game, it's not uncommon for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> to be just like that.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Note that this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. During World War II, military medics were supposed to go into combat with no weapons and treat the wounded of either side. However, German medics were often armed with pistols, and this led Allied soldiers to be somewhat skeptical of the non-combatant status of German medics, as taking up a weapon meant the medic forfeited his protection under the Geneva Convention and was treated as a regular combatant, regardless of any distinguishing insignia he wore, and from the German side, troops like the SS even made it a point to use wounded soldiers as bait to lure allied soldiers out and shoot them, forcing the medics to take up arms and protect themselves. In the Pacific and the Eastern Front, there were no niceties at all — both sides considered medical personnel fair game, though for the Japanese it wasn't so much that they actively targeted medical personnel, more that they had no concept of noncombatant medics; to them, a soldier was a soldier. In fact, by the end of 1941, medics in the Russian Theater even stopped wearing medical handbands because they both were useless and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMedicFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMedicFirst">painted them brighter as targets</a>. Nowadays, this trope is even encouraged in real life, due to the fact that most modern armies engage in combat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BananaRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BananaRepublic">with</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplesRepublicOfTyranny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplesRepublicOfTyranny">forces</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">that</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerrorismTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerrorismTropes">do not</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganizedCrimeTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganizedCrimeTropes">respect</a> the Geneva conventions.

</li><li> Dr. Landon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/DarwinsSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/DarwinsSoldiers">Darwin's Soldiers</a></em> starts off as a civilian surgeon rescued by the main characters, but is more than happy to pick up a pistol and becomes more combat proficient as he survives the teams' various firefights. Also Sharon Redfield, the medic and third-in-command of Cobalt Squad, is a military example.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Tabletop Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>:
<ul><li> The entire Cleric class is dedicated to this in the first and second editions. Instead of squishies, Clerics are the second-best tanks in the game (near the monks and just behind the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTank">warrior</a> classes) as well as gaining healing spells very early on and having decent mana. Their main drawback is that they can't use bladed weapons. (This is actually a fair mechanic, considering about 75% of the weapons in the game are bladed. This includes all the good ranged weapons.)
</li><li> In 3rd Edition, efforts to make the Cleric "more fun" to play brought it closer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a> than Combat Medic: in <em>addition</em> to remaining the best healer class, the cleric's offensive capacities went up. Having the ability to turn their prepared spells into healing spells also let them devote more slots to their awesome combat buffs. An abusive player can throw the team balance out of whack simply by exploiting all the class's best options, leading to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nickname</a> "CoDZilla".
</li><li> In 3.5e, they introduced a dedicated Healer class. It turned out to be a less versatile Cleric in most circumstances.
</li><li> In 4th edition, there are several classes that fit the Combat Medic trope — the Cleric, Bard, Druid (in the Essentials version), Warlord, and Ardent — each with different strengths so that, for example, an Ardent and a Warlord in the same party complement each other rather than infringing on each others' roles. Most of their healing spells are tied to attacks, or minor actions, which let them support their allies while fighting at the same time.
</li><li> And in 5th Edition, this trend continues. Druids, Bards and Paladins are all exceptional healers as well as scrappers, and even Rangers can become quite capable healers if built correctly. Most surprisingly, the new Warlock class can also use healing magic if they take the Celestial Patronage, spells like Cure Wounds and Restoration (Lesser and Greater) become available as bonus spells. Naturally Clerics are still the poster child for this, and Life domain Clerics exemplify this best of all: all their healing spells are more effective than other Clerics, but along with those of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorMonk">War</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">Tempest</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBlacksmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBlacksmith">Forge</a> domains, Life Clerics are also proficient with heavy armour. Alternatively, Grave domain Clerics focus on magic for restoring life at the brink of death; they make sure allies about to go to their grave don't go in there just yet, and they also make sure that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightOfTheLivingMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightOfTheLivingMooks">the horrible things that do belong in the grave</a>, <em>stay down in the grave</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Lancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Lancer">Lancer</a></em> has the Lancaster, which was designed to be large and fast so it could reach struggling allies in a pinch and take a few hits itself. Players quickly realized this combination of traits made it quite good at ramming. It also carries welding torches and nanomachine swarms, ostensibly for repairs, that can be turned on unlucky enemies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em>, a game which essentially took over the 3.X version of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, has more Combat Medics. The Paladin can play this role, as they now have mass-healing abilities and have been heavily upgraded from their 3.5 Incarnation. The Cleric, who got a few nerfs to avoid Codzilla, still fits this trope, as can many Oracle builds. The Witch skirts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedMage">Red Mage</a> and Combat Medic, as they have healing but they also are far from a Jack character at magic. A properly made Alchemist and even Bard can also fall into this role.
<ul><li> The <em>Advanced Class Guide</em> added the Warpriest class, which blends the martial prowess of a Fighter with the divine magic of a Cleric, though in practice it seems more built to bridge the gap between the martial-focused Paladin and the magic-focused Cleric. They get the ability to enhance their weapons and armor, a special healing ability separate from their magic, and a selection of "blessings" that can be used to support allies, increase their damage, or damage and hinder their opponents.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/D20Modern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/D20Modern">d20 Modern</a></em> has several class combinations to be a combat medic.
<ul><li> Dedicated Hero + Acolyte/field medic. The acolyte can wield divine spells, including healing, the Field Medic can revive a dead party member in the round following his/her death.
</li><li> Strong hero + starting occupation with treat injury as a class skill + Surgery feat. Not as good as a dedicated medic, but still able to heal as well as injure.
</li><li> Fast hero + starting occupation with Treat Injury as a class skill + Surgery feat. For all the gunslinger out there.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em>'s DocWagon High Threat Response Teams are Combat Medics For Hire. In many cities they or their competitors are the only ambulances in operation. Notably, DocWagon does not care whether or not the patient has a SIN - the SINless just have to pay for at least the basic contract (5000 Nuyen per year) in advance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Cyberpunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Cyberpunk">Cyberpunk</a> 2020</em> has Trauma Team, which is essentially the same as Doc Wagon above. Their regular ambulance crew includes two "security personnel" whose task is to pacify the pickup zone if necessary. Preferably using the machine gun mounted on the armored ambulance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Astartes</a> Apothecaries are just as combat effective as their battle-brothers while having the ability to keep their comrades in the fight, unless they are mortally wounded. Then they just euthanize them and rip out the organ responsible for growing new genetic material for the chapter. Depending on the edition of the game, the rules for Apothecaries allow them to make their fellows tougher, heal wounds or even bring them back from the brink of death.
</li><li> Space Wolves don't have apothecaries (at least not until they got the primaris version). Treatment of the wounded often fell to the Wolf Priests (their chaplain analogues) who often carry around a horn of ointments and holistic cures. This somehow works just as well as the cocktail of drugs other Apothecaries carry.
</li><li> Astra Militarum examples:
<ul><li> The field medics who accompany Astra Militarum Command Squads are typically Veteran Guardsmen with a degree of medical skill equipped with a medi-pack that, depending on the tech-level of the regiment's homeworld, could be anything from a roll of bandages to a sophisticated auto-diagnostic and treatment kit. In-game these medics have the same combat abilities as every other Veteran in the squad and, depending on the edition, make it more difficult to wound members of the squad and/or heal wounded characters.
</li><li> The Death Korps Quartermaster combines the role of medic with the technical skill required to recover damaged equipment and the spiritual training to administer comfort to the dying. The Quartermaster is also an officer who accompanies his regiment to the front lines and has the combat skills required to survive the hell of trench warfare. In the 8th Edition of the rules, the Quartermaster Revenant has characteristics superior to a Death Watch Veteran and is equipped with a medi-kit that he can use to heal nearby allies.
</li></ul></li><li> Orks have Mad Doks. While they do carry supplies for treating wounded Orks their reputation is such that nearby Orks are more likely to decide that their injuries aren't that bad than risk letting the Dok treat them.
</li><li> Death Guard have Plague Surgeons, one of the only Chaos Legions to have retained their Apothecaries post-fall. They make the already tough-as-balls Death Guard even harder to drop. Because of their age and diseased hulk, they are even more formidable than their loyalist counterparts.
</li><li> The Genestealer Cult Biophagus is implied to be a doctor in the lore (he was handing out "vaccinations" to a local imperial guard regiment that is also experiencing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">completely unrelated high desertion rate</a>.) In-game however he acts more as a buffer, giving stim-boosts to Aberrants and other cult troops. However, while he is squishy, he is still part genestealer, with all the combat prowess that entails.
</li><li> In 4th edition, a cheap Necron Lord with the Resurrection Orb was considered essential for Necron Warriors or Immortals gunlines; not only did he keep the necrons alive via the Orb, but he also provided essential melee prowess if any of the units were charged by dedicated melee specialists. Destroyer Lords likewise often took one as well to keep up with Destroyers. This was largely phased out in later editions where the Orb became less and less effective in reviving troops and Necrons in general became harder and harder to kill.
</li></ul></li><li> Medic specialists in the 2018 version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000KillTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000KillTeam">Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team</a></em> are just as capable as their fellows in battle but are also able to boost the resilience of members of the kill team and, with the right skills, heal their comrade's injuries.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> has a few. Battlefield Medic, most Cleric creatures, and now Frontline Medic. Most decks with life gain effects apply this to the player, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage">unless built solely to support a team</a>.
<ul><li> Ironically, the actual "Combat Medic" <em>card</em>, dating back to the <em>Fallen Empires</em> expansion set, isn't one of these. It has 0 power (meaning it can't deal damage in combat without being boosted first) and no other offensive abilities either; it's solely useful for its damage-prevention ability and perhaps on occasion as a blocker.
</li></ul></li><li> A function of how magic works in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening">Mage: The Awakening</a></em>. A mage who knows enough about the Life Arcanum to heal someone else also knows how to buff up their own physical stats or turn plants into bees to set them on their enemies. At higher levels of Life magic, one can shapeshift others, degrade their physical stats, inflict diseases, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">cause someone's body to tear itself apart</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> wargame doesn't actually have a proper medic class, but down at the tactical level with the <em>Mechwarrior</em> RPG, field medic builds are invaluable. Any character can carry a handful of medpatches or a medkit to handle minor cuts and bruises, and most will take a rank of First Aid to improve their effectiveness, but due to the harder nature of the setting (lacking resurrection or instant healing) having at least one player character with several ranks in Med-Tech and/or Surgery is common. As it turns out, the stats that control medical prowess also turn field medics into <em>fantastic</em> explosives experts, such that many field medics are also demolitionists. A properly statted and spec'ed field medic can easily be put at the controls of something with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">a whole heaping bunch of missiles</a> and easily hold their own while being no less effective at healing injured characters.
</li><li> Thanks to the functionality of the point-buy system in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantsAndMasterminds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantsAndMasterminds">Mutants &amp; Masterminds</a></em>, a character who selects Healing as a power is in no way barred from also buying more combat-oriented abilities- and are in fact encouraged to do so, since the game's Power Level system heavily supports all characters having some baseline level of fighting ability. While it is both possible and easy to build a superhero with no combat ability save for healing, you'd just be deliberately handicapping yourself.
</li><li> New German Republic medical officers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts">Rifts</a></em> are every bit as well-armed and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillWearArmorInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillWearArmorInTheFuture">armored</a> as any other soldier, and field ambulances are just as armed as any APC. This is because the Gargoyles don't give a damn about Geneva or its conventions.
</li><li> All characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendSystem">Legend System</a></em> can fight to some degree, so anybody with healing abilities is automatically this. The Sage and Shaman classes are more explicitly this trope: the Sage can heal in a radius and give allies extra turns in-between blowing away enemies with waves of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">Black Magic</a>, while the Shaman can cast incantations that can either heal or harm, and gets a spell list with plenty of options for both supporting and blasting. Thanks to the game's multiclassing system, any character who chooses the aforementioned class tracks also becomes a Combat Medic.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PlanetMercenary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PlanetMercenary">Planet Mercenary</a></em> allows any player to gain any skill, the Command Package of Doctor gives initial bonuses to Medicine, Xenobiology, Dodge, and any one Combat skill.

Both the Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy troops that the Marines come up against have their own medics, who are armed with Nambu Type 14s, and won't hesitate to shoot back when trying to treat their own wounded.
</li><li> Being a Combat Medic is common in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PlanetSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PlanetSide">PlanetSide</a> 1</em>. Almost all players are certified in the basic medical equipment, so they can heal themselves and their teammates in combat. Further certifications allow them to revive their downed teammates.
<ul><li> In the sequel, the Combat Medic becomes one of the six classes. They are the only ones who have access to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll">powerful, accurate, and rapid-fire</a> Assault Rifles in addition to the multi-class SMGs and shotguns, and they can (of course) revive allies and heal themselves and others. Further specialization allows them to deploy a shield regeneration bubble, passively heal allies near the medic's vehicle, and toss out healing and reviving grenades. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEngineer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEngineer">The Engineer</a>, another class, is equivalent to the medic for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">MAX suits</a> and vehicles, and while the engineer carries a weaker carbine, they can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTurretMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTurretMaster">deploy turrets</a> and use anti-material rifles.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortressClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortressClassic">Team Fortress Classic</a></em> has the Combat Medic class. Armed with a Medkit that can be used for healing teammates and infecting the enemy team, a super nail-gun, four frag grenades, three concussion grenades that can be used for disorienting players and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketJump">be used to fly across the map</a>, and two shotguns, the class can be the poster child of this trope in video games. The Medic is also the second-fastest class behind the scout, is immune to infection, and regenerates his own health over time.
<ul><li> Due to the abilities of this class, the Combat Medic is the preferred class over the scout when it comes to completing the objectives; but it also results in the class barely being used for its intended purpose, to heal and help support his teammates in battle.
</li><li> The engineer can also count with his ability to repair teammates' armor with his wrench, if he has enough metal to do so.
</li></ul></li><li> Heavily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">downplayed</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>: the Medic has average health<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0p8h6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0p8h6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0p8h6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the Scout, Engineer, Sniper, and Spy have 125 HP; the Medic has 150 HP; the Pyro and Demoman have 175 HP; the Soldier has 200 HP; and the Heavy has 300 HP</span> (with slow health regeneration) and is (again) the second-fastest class in the game (only the Scout is faster), but his primary weapon only has above-average damage at best and is very hard to use because it fires slow, arcing projectiles. This makes him better at fighting than the other "Support" classes<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1n386');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1n386" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1n386');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Medic vs. Engineer is only slightly tilted in the Medic's favor, but Medic vs. Sniper or Medic vs. Spy in a straight-up fight tends to see the Medic with a major advantage</span> but horribly disadvantaged against any class whose main purpose is actually fighting. Besides which, the Medic's healing function is very important and desired — fighting at any time other than self-defense, finishing off an enemy, or hunting Spies is an extremely inefficient use of the class and <em>WILL</em> frustrate your team. This was done because in an earlier build of TF2 (and, as mentioned before, the original <em>Team Fortress</em>), the Medic had much more potent weapons, but as a result, none of the medic playtesters bothered to heal anyone.
<ul><li> The above applies to the conventional TF2 game modes. When the Medic finds his way into a mod like Zombie Fortress, many of the detriments that limited this class can become quite helpful if used properly. Overheal stays much longer on Survivors than it did in normal modes, and the speed of the Medic can help him stay ahead of two of the three zombies classes. Throw in the melee restriction that all zombies have, and a Medic can become a lethal adversary who seems impossible to chase down and kill.
</li><li> Chain Übers<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note21ld1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note21ld1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note21ld1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Two Medics using <a class="urllink" href="http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Ubersaw">ubersaws<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to build up consecutive ubercharges</span>, however, play this trope straight. If you can't split the two <em>invulnerable</em> medics or run away from them (and, remember, <em>they're the second-fastest class in the game</em>, so good luck with that unless you're a Scout), <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9T_kvDvQnY&amp;feature=relmfu#t=2m25s">expect a lot of trouble.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoItemUseForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoItemUseForYou">Medieval Mode</a>, where class roles are wildly different from the regular game, Medic plays the trope much straighter. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingShiv" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingShiv">crossbow</a> is the second-best ranged weapon in the mode (and 6 classes don't even <em>have</em> a ranged weapon) and heals teammates it hits. The Amputator gives him one of the mode's two Area of Effect heals while boosting his heal rate when out, making him a very well-rounded fighter at any range that will still proceed to patch up all surviving teammates after a skirmish.
</li><li> This trope can apply in the opposite manner with <em>other</em> classes using certain unlockable weapons that help allies regain health, such as a Heavy with a Sandvich (can restore half of an ally's health every half a minute), a Scout with Mad Milk/Soldier with a Concheror (both grant a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain">Life Drain</a> in different ways), or Scout with a Candy Cane (enemies they kill drop health packs). Obviously, none are nearly as effective at healing as a Medic, but they can still be pretty useful.
</li><li> "Combat Medic" or "Battle Medic" happens to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nickname</a> for players that focus more on combat then healing when playing as the Medic. As mentioned earlier, this isn't always a good thing, and can frustrate your team if you're not healing them often enough.
</li></ul></li><li> Medics in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em> are just regular troops that happen to hand out medkits. They aren't any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">squishier</a> than their compatriots, and are just as capable of fighting.
<ul><li> Justified by the fact that the Combine will gladly gun them down, since they're alien occupiers and there are no Geneva Conventions left to follow.
</li></ul></li><li> The Medic NPC from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1">Half Life 1</a>: Opposing Force</em> has a Desert Eagle and will often engage alien and Black Ops units. In a modification where some maps have a heavy use of the Medic (Sven Co-Op), they'll often open fire first.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein3D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein3D">Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory</a></em>, the medic class is one of the best fighting classes due to their higher starting health, auto-regen, ability to heal themselves, and adrenalin needles (at higher levels). A medic that just fights and never heals other players is often called a "rambo medic." Experienced players are fond of playing rambo medics because they require aiming skill. Oh, and they can also revive players to full health if they run out of hitpoints but aren't damaged enough to completely die, meaning that if 2-3 of these rambo medics decide to work together, you better have a panzerfaust ready or get out of their way.
</li><li> Guardian from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DirtyBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DirtyBomb">Dirty Bomb</a></em> generally focuses more on combat than the other medics on account of having assault rifles in her arsenal. Even then, the other medics are still pretty dangerous in combat by being pretty much limited by distance as their SMGs out DPS the other rifles at short ranges.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield">Battlefield</a> 2</em>, one of the unlockable weapons for the medic is the G36E, an assault rifle so accurate and well-rounded that some will argue it borders on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> status.
<ul><li> Hell, the entire series has this. Medics are as well-equipped as the Assault class, just with the Medikit instead of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeLauncher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeLauncher">Grenade Launcher</a>. In <em>1942</em>, an SMG in the right hands entirely obsoletes Assault as a front-line class. In most games, reviving a teammate will take back spawn tickets lost during their deaths, so heavy medic use can single-handedly turn the tide of a game.
</li><li> And in <em>2142</em>, they simply dispensed with a separate medic class and rolled it into the assault class.
</li><li> And in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlefieldBadCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlefieldBadCompany">Battlefield: Bad Company</a> 2</em> &amp; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlefieldPlay4Free" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlefieldPlay4Free">Play4Free</a></em>, the medic was again separated from the assault class and armed with a <strong>light machine gun</strong> (in effect, the support and medic kit swapped guns compared to BF2). Sounds silly and unbalanced at first, but then again it makes perfect sense for a support-oriented class to carry a fire support weapon. Especially since LMGs in that game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryGunPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryGunPower">lack the mobility and raw strength of assault rifles, but make up for it with great range and volume of fire</a>. The machine guns literally become more accurate the longer you hold the trigger, so standing still and hosing the air works out the best for effective MG use.
<ul><li> In gameplay terms, the light machine gun and medical capabilities make the medic the most team-oriented player. Conversely... a group of four medics is commonly used to troll people with a nigh invincible cluster of machine guns that simply revive each other in turn. A tank or Carl Gustav recoiless rifles are generally some of the easiest solutions.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield3">Battlefield 3</a></em> returns to the <em>2142</em> style of combining the assault and medic class. Assault players can choose between a third weapon (either a single-shot grenade launcher or a bolt-action shotgun, potentially mounted to their rifle) or a medkit, meaning that they can choose between being an all-out attacker with enormous firepower or a healer who's more than capable of shooting back - and thanks to the ever-present Defibrillator, as either one he'll still be able to revive downed teammates <em>to full health</em> (though this is only if the patient accepts the revive by standing up). This Combat Medic class is so strong at killing infantry and surviving, it's the dominant class in any deathmatch modes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillingFloor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillingFloor">Killing Floor</a></em> embraces the Combat Medic idea with the "Field Medic" perk, which could be seen as a combination of a healer and a tank. They have the strongest (and cheapest) body armor in the game, resistance to acidic puke and run the fastest of any class. With their healing tool that recharges faster and is more efficient than the standard one, their rather good dedicated weapons (SMGs that have heal darts as their secondary fire) and their allies-healing enemy-poisoning gas grenades, they're an important part of almost every game.
<ul><li> On the enemies' side, the Scrake was designed to be the ultimate medic, but it eventually decided that hurting and killing people was much more fun than healing them.
</li></ul></li><li> The Medic class in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Resistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Resistance">Resistance</a> 2</em>'s Co-op multiplayer mode comes equipped with a gun called the Phoenix. While not as powerful as standard (or Chimeran) ordnance, it allows the user to drain an enemy's life force and convert it to cartridges that can heal your fellow team members. The medic is the only class that can survive on its own while still fighting indefinitely because his gun does not use ammo, and when it damages enemies, it heals him in the process. The spec-ops, in turn, can give himself ammo, but can't heal himself if hurt, and the soldier is utterly screwed if he runs out of ammo or can't get healed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReturnToCastleWolfenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReturnToCastleWolfenstein">Return to Castle Wolfenstein</a></em>, medics can only be armed with the standard submachine gun. However, combine this with the fact that medics can easily keep themselves healed, a medic can become a literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a> as long as he has a steady supply of ammo. <em>Enemy Territory</em> takes this even further by giving high level medics the ability to inject themselves with a stimulant that temporarily, but vastly, increases their speed and reduces the damage they take. They also have the ability to passively regenerate their own health and have the highest base health out of all of the classes. There is a reason why these medics are called Rambo Medics.
</li><li> Almost universal in <em>MAG</em>, since all it takes to be a medic is the Medi-Kit item and three points in the Medic skill tree (one point in the Resuscitation skill branch), all of which are available at level 3. While the Medi-Kit takes up almost a third of a loadout (10 points out of up to 34 in a loadout), that's still enough for most class configurations to fit their essential parts (primary weapon, role-specific gear and armor).
</li><li> Roland from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands">Borderlands</a></em> has a skill tree called <em>Medic</em> which includes an ability to restore health to allies when he makes a kill and best of all Cauterize, which allows him to heal teammates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingShiv" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingShiv">by shooting them</a>.
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">the sequel</a>, Maya is the character with healing abilities with her Harmony tree. Along with the aforementioned healing via bullets, she can make it so that enemies trapped in her Phaselock ability release health orbs if killed and can even revive character doing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">Last Stand</a> with said ability.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/BorderlandsThePreSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/BorderlandsThePreSequel">Pre-Sequel</a>, team healing isn't limited to just one character. Athena can heal nearby allies simply by having her shield out. Wilhelm's healing drone Saint can create a healing zone when it's destroyed/recalled. Claptrap can cause the team to regen health simply by dealing elemental damage as well as causing a healing explosion either around enemies he kills or himself when his shields are destroyed.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Syndicate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Syndicate">Syndicate</a></em> reboot one of the co-op Breaches is the ability to heal allies. It turns out to have been stolen from Eurocorp; like the co-op characters, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Merit and the Twins can do this. To win that boss fight, you have to temporarily disable Merit, run down the health of a Twin, then do a melee execution.</span>
</li><li> Due to the emphasis on customisation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Brink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Brink">Brink</a></em>, there's nothing stopping a medic from being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> who wades into combat with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">minigun</a> and grenade launcher.
</li><li> The medics in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Vietcong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Vietcong">Vietcong</a></em> are always armed with either a submachine gun or an assault rifle.
</li><li> Any of the characters from the medic class in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Evolve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Evolve">Evolve</a></em>. Depending on who you pick you could be armed with an armor piercing sniper rifle, a napalm grenade launchers, or missile pods. Justified, as hunting gigantic extraterrestrial killing machines unarmed would be a good way to get killed quickly.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch">Overwatch</a></em>, all the medic characters have some capability for combat. Soldier: 76 fulfills the "Combat" aspect, being an Offense character who excels at firefights, but can use his <em>Biotic Field</em> to heal others. Mercy embodies the "Medic" part of this trope, as the Support whose main role is to heal or buff others, or even bring them back from the dead, but she can defend herself with a pistol <em>if</em> she really has to. Zenyatta is a buffer/debuffer that can also deal decent damage and whose ultimate is a massive AoE heal. Lucio can passively heal allies around him while his sound gun is good for crowd-control and potential environmental kills. Ana carries a special rifle that lets her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingShiv" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingShiv">heal allies by shooting them</a> while also functioning as a regular sniper rifle to enemies.
<ul><li> On the same note, Baptiste is the Support hero that fully embodies the Combat Medic playstyle. Has a three-round burst rifle for mid to long-range combat, a Biotic grenade launcher mounted on his rifle that heals allies, an Inmmortality Field that makes his allies unkillable while they are inside the field and his Ultimate lets him project an Amplification Matrix, which doubles the damage and healing that pass through it for his allies and himself.
</li></ul></li><li> While the Support champions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Paladins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Paladins">Paladins</a></em> are no slouches in combat, some are better at dealing damage:
<ul><li> Jenos is a Support champion who was specifically designed to be geared more towards damage. He's fast, wields a machine gun, can immobilize enemies, has a simple use-and-forget healing ability, and has an Ultimate that fires a singular, high-damage beam that penetrates all terrain in the targeted direction.
</li><li> Grohk's Maelstrom talent reduces the cooldown of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainLightning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainLightning">Shock Pulse</a>, allowing him to destroy grouped-up enemies and get a damage score on par with Damage and Flank champions.
</li><li> Furia has a powerful shotgun (actually a magical sword that functions just like a shotgun) and her unique mechanic increases her rate of fire when she heals allies. Her other abilities are also offensive in nature: Wings of Wrath launches homing fireballs, and Pyre Strike is a beam that damages and stuns enemies caught in it.

</p><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Guenevere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Guenevere">Guenevere</a></em>, Guen can choose to spec both in light (that is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl">healing</a>) magic and sword-fighting.

</p><ul><li> The Paladin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII">Diablo II</a></em> serves as the closest thing to a 'support class' in the game, with his auras capable of providing powerful buffs to himself and his allies. (And even an actual direct <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReviveKillsZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReviveKillsZombie">healing</a> spell, though you'd be hard pressed to find any players who can even name it.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodlineChampions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodlineChampions">Bloodline Champions</a></em> has a Healer archetype whose bloodlines are all far from helpless, as well as other bloodlines within other archetypes that are capable of healing their allies to a lesser degree. Additionally, being able to heal themselves constantly can make them quite tough to fight if it goes down to just one-on-one in a match, as every mistake non-healers make against them will be punished by having few to no ways to recover from it while they instead can try to disengage and heal back up.
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">MMORPGs</span>
</p><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsGalaxies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsGalaxies">Star Wars: Galaxies</a></em> has a class tree literally named "Combat Medic", the full mastery of which allowed the use long range poisons to cripple enemies as well as perform his healing duties.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></em>. The Jedi Sage, Sith Sorcerer, Scoundrel, Operative, Mercenary, and Commando advanced classes can function as healing classes. The Commando even has a healing specialization <em>called</em> Combat Medic. Each class has a companion character that fits this role as well.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em>, Masterminds who choose the "Mercenaries" powerset eventually receive a Medic as a henchman. The Medic can only use his healing power once every couple of minutes... the rest of the time, he's blasting away with his assault rifle.
<ul><li> Additionally, both Defenders and Corruptors combine Buff/Debuff skills (including healing) with ranged attacks.
</li></ul></li><li> All of the healer classes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> can just change specialisation to deal damage (or even tank in some cases), but only three classes can dish out damage even while in healer spec. Of these three, use melee attacks to regenerate mana, while paladins and Discipline priests outright convert their damage into healing. In previous expansions, hybrid damage/healing specs were even more common, such as Shadow priests healing their party members via vampirism.
<ul><li> Some fights require each member of the party to kill some literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithin">inner demon</a> that only they can see. Since healers back in the day had virtually no damage capabilities, the stats for + heal and + spell damage eventually got merged into a single + spell power. Since healers' attacking abilities are either Holy or Nature spells, the Inner Demons in that fight were made particularly vulnerable to Holy and Nature spell damage.
</li><li> Blood Death Knights were originally designed to be a "healer" spec for the class by having them heal through their aura while fighting. This did not make it very far in testing when a group of players made their entire group these and proceeded to curbstomp dungeons due to everyone constantly being cumulatively healed by their four teammates.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarhammerOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarhammerOnline">Warhammer Online</a>: Age of Reckoning</em> has three healer classes per faction. All of them have at least some damage or debuff potential, but the Sigmarite Warrior Priest and the Disciple of Khaine actually need to melee to get the most out of their healing power. Due to this hybrid nature, they're likely among the best classes for both solo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusEnvironment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusEnvironment">Player Versus Environment</a> gameplay and 1on1 duels with other players. As with Shadow Priests, they tend to get a lot of flak should they dare to prefer hitting over healing...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfConan">Age of Conan</a></em>'s healing classes (Tempest of Set, Bear Shaman, and Priest of Mitra) are all designed to heal by using offensive spells. (Offensive spells, or attacks, let them charge up and improve healing spells.) This actually ended up to the point that they out-damaged the traditional damage archetype (the Demonologist), though they still could not compare to the Herald of Xotli.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EdenEternal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EdenEternal">Eden Eternal</a></em> has four healing classes that do this,but Sage class outshines them all. Sages melee enemies like most classes do, except their skills also have bonus buffs when used, such as healing allies' HP or MP when striking an enemy with said skills.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em>' attributes and dual-class system allows for healers to take on offensive roles, or offensive classes to take on healing. Monks (standard healers) can become damage classes through Smiting Prayers; Necromancers and Elementalists (non-healers) can become healers by exploiting balance issues, and the Ritualist class is designed to both heal and deal damage (though since unlike monks their primary attribute does not effect their healing significantly, combined with AI issues that make otherwise stronger builds less viable when used by a hero, most ritualist healers are necromancer/ritualist).
</li><li> Shamans and Oracles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AtlanticaOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AtlanticaOnline">Atlantica Online</a></em> both have an offensive ability that makes up to two enemies take damage over time and more damage in general. The Monk on the other hand has purely supportive abilities, but all three have a decent attack that can hit flying enemies. Attacking is much needed, too, as a lot of experience comes from killing blows.
</li><li> The healer class of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AirRivals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AirRivals">Air Rivals</a></em> also functions as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a>, so it's not uncommon to see some of them striking into enemy lines like everyone else. Furthermore, it is widely considered to be the best overall fighter in one-on-one dueling, due to a combination of self-healing, self-buffing, and an exclusive reverse-flying ability that grants unparalleled maneuverability in close quarters.
</li><li> The Monks and their upgraded forms in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline">Ragnarok Online</a></em>. They start as a standard Acolyte, same as Priests but lack many of the heals and buffs of the Priest to allow them to dish out some nice melee damage.
<ul><li> Priests themselves can be pretty easily built, given the proper resources and gear, to be <em>very</em> capable melee fighters- and also not necessarily at the cost of losing all of their supporting ability, due to RO's allowing you to stat your character pretty much however you want. Less SP isn't an issue either, since the strength they've invested in allows them to carry more items, and therefore more mana pots/equipment. A well built one can easily function as both a fighter/tanker and primary support for midtier parties, though, granted, in higher tier dungeons, even with Assumptio in play if you're a High Priest, their heal amounts probably won't cut it for being primary healer.
</li></ul></li><li> Korean MMORPG <em>Priston Tale</em> contains the "Priestess" class, who is the game's primary healer, but in earlier versions, was considered the most powerful offensive class in the game due to their AoE elemental magic.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wizard101" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wizard101">Wizard 101</a></em> this applies to the healers of the game- life wizards. They have more healing spells than attack spells, but their attack spells aren't bad, especially when buffed, and they have the second highest amount of life points. Some wizards will dual-build Life/Ice in order to become effective tanks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rift">Rift</a></em> lets mages specialize in "chloromancy" alongside their other schools of magic. While they gain a couple direct heals, the vast majority of their healing comes from skills that allow them and their party to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain">convert damage output into healing</a>. Bards are similar, converting their combo points into healing, and all the cleric souls feature melee damage, offensive magic, and healing in various combinations.
<ul><li> In regards to the Cleric, it should probably be mentioned that their tanking soul (Justicar) features a nigh-mandatory talent that causes five of your allies to be healed for 25% of the damage your Justicar attacks deal (and 10% of the damage from non-Justicar attacks). Put on Mien of Honor (50% bonus to said healing), grab a staff, and start spamming your Justicar AoE attack; you're LITERALLY healing your allies by BEATING PEOPLE WITH A STICK.

So you have a healer/bard combo to heal and buff, or you can have a healer/gunner. You could also have a healer/bard/gunner/swordsman/defensive/dark magic/craftsman, but don't expect them to be great at any one job. You can also use items to heal allies during combat without taking skill in healing magic, making this another viable option for combat medic, but you'll need money to pay for the items.

None of these characters are slouches in combat either; Yukari and Yukiko are each their respective party's strongest magical damage dealer, Ken is reasonably tough and has some insta-kill spells in his arsenal, Morgana has passable Strength and decent Agility (though his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway">wind magic spells</a> are somewhat weak), and Makoto and Teddie are both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">well-balanced stat-wise</a> (they both suffer a bit in Luck, but compensate with Makoto's high Agility and Teddie's solid Magic). Of course, with the proper Persona set up, the protagonist can be this as well (in fact, in <em>3</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIRoulette">you were kind of forced to...</a>).

One just heals party members, the other heals them as well as giving a buff, but weakens you in the process. The latter can have a stat build specifically for making full use of it to heal your party, making it one of the only times there is a specific "support roll" in the entire hack and slash game. The Japanese only skill will allow you to even distribute the effects of an item between your friends, so you can prepare to find healing items allowing you heal your party in the process.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Flyff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Flyff">Flyff</a></em>, the designated healers/buffers are the Ringmasters. They have a grand whopping total of one offensive spell. Just one, and that's it. Because their job in a party is to make sure the party doesn't die, this is usually the last skill they bother to train. It is the single most powerful area of effect skill in the game. While its initial damage is the same as a few other abilities, it also has a damage over time effect that lasts ten seconds, pushing it into the top spot. Its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cooldown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cooldown">cooldown</a> is... ten seconds.
</li><li> A healer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunaOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunaOnline">Luna Online</a></em> come with a few holy elemental magic that can be upgraded. While they are not as powerful as other classes' skills, they are great at assist kill when the enemies are busy picking off other characters. It's even possible to solo cleric via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">Death of a Thousand Cuts</a> strategy since healers in <em>Luna Online</em> can survive just fine by spamming healing spells on self while attacking.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretWorld">The Secret World</a></em>, assault rifle "leech healers" heal by doing damage, a percentage of which gets converted to healing. Other weapon combinations can do this to some extent, although the stats required for healing and damage are different, so doing this outside of assault rifles usually doesn't work as well in groups.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildStar">WildStar</a></em> Medics <em>are</em> actual doctors, with legit medical degrees. They just use their Resonators, tools of healing, as tools of destruction as well, because just plain healing in a nice, safe office out of the action has stopped being profitable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em>:
<ul><li> All classes are capable of using weapons, but tactical officers are only a DPS class with a couple of buffs and debuffs. However, engineering and science officers have access to a mix of healing skills and more directly combat-related skills, although science is more known as the healer class particularly in ground combat (engineering relies more on being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroneDeployer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroneDeployer">Drone Deployer</a> dirtside).
</li><li> In a story example, Dr. Rhian Cratak, the chief medical officer of the Romulan Republic flagship RRW <em>Lleiset</em>, pulls a disruptor on a group of Vaadwaur who board the ship in "Capture the Flag", helping the player take them down by shooting them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBack">In the Back</a>.
</li><li> "Combat Medic" is a Federation and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse">Terran Empire</a> NPC/enemy. Players may also spec their characters or Bridge officers into filling this role if they wish.
</li></ul></li><li> The healer classes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> are built around being able to do just as much damage as a caster. Prior to 4.0, doing this relied on their Cleric Stance ability, which switches their healing stat (mind) with their offensive magic stat (int). Post-4.0, their mind stat boosts both healing and offensive magic, and Cleric Stance was changed to a temporary damage buff. You're taught very early on that healing isn't all you should be expected to do, and many players are happy when a healer can balance both keeping the party alive and doling out damage (though there's no shame if you can't, because you might not be geared enough).

<ul><li> This does carry over a little to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dota2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dota2">Dota 2</a></em>, but almost every support character is expected to build group healing items to help out the team, making them all this.
<ul><li> The best example in the sequel is most likely Omniknight, who has a healing ability, a temporary spell-immunity buff, and a mass temporary damage immunity spell for his ultimate ability.
</li><li> Witch Doctor can be considered as one, since it has an ability of healing himself and his allies around. He also has an attack that bounces around enemies and stun them and has an ultimate that deals ridiculous amount of damage, but it's channeled.
</li><li> Oracle plays this in a weird way, in that his primary healing spell deals a large burst of damage to the target, and then applies a rapid regeneration effect. Because the spell can target enemies and allies, pierces Spell Immunity, and multiple copies of its regeneration stack, if played incorrectly, Oracle can unintentionally <em>heal his enemies</em> more than he harms them.
</li><li> Some carry heroes with strong early game presence and little use for their large mana pool (most notably Viper, Razor, and Shadow Fiend) will also buy the healing item Mekanism to complement their teamfight strength. Dark Seer in particular is often referred to as a "Mek Carrier", in that he can effectively buy and use a Mekanism fairly early in the game (and later upgrade it to the much more powerful Guardian Greaves), while otherwise being played as a core hero.

His mana regenerates when he deals damage and the cooldown on his heal decreases when he strikes an opponent, so fighting improves his healing and sustainability. His heal spell also heals both its target and himself, allowing him to recover from damage without neglecting his support duties. His Shatter ability used to give bonus armor to himself and an aura that increased the armor of allies, temporarily losing the aura when he activated the spell to damage enemies and reduce their armor. Now he retains the aura and loses the personal armor bonus, letting him use it without weakening the rest of his team.
<ul><li> Kayle also qualifies, being able to unload damage onto a target while healing and hasting allies, and making them temporarily invulnerable.
</li><li> Both iterations of Karma serve(d) as this. Pre-rework, she had two charges of Mantra. Her basic Q did <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AoE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AoE">Ao E</a> damage, her W was a slow when used on an enemy and a speed-up when used on an ally and her E was simply a strong shield. Her passive got her more and more AP the less HP she had. If her skills were empowered, her Q added a procentual <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AoE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AoE">Ao E</a> heal that additionally scaled with AP, the Speed/Slow was doubled and her shield added a nuke equal to the shielded damage plus [b]80%[\b] of her AP. She was very dangerous at low levels of health, being both a strong combatant and capable support.
<ul><li> The new Karma has a passive that reduces the CD of her Mantra Charge when she hits an enemy with spells or basic attacks. Her Q is a notoriously strong nuke when charged, however it's no slouch when used in its basic form either. Her W roots and damages her target, if it's empowered it also heals her for up to 40% of her missing health. Her E is a single target shield that grants movement speed while her empowered E adds strength to the primary target's shield and grants an <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AoE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AoE">Ao E</a> shield for allies surrounding the shields target, also granting them movement. The longer the fight goes and the more damage she can dish out, the more use can be made of her.

With one splash, she can potentially save her carry <em>and</em> pick off the low-health sap trying to escape.
</li><li> Soraka was almost a non-combatant, being able to sit well away from the fighting while keeping her carry's health and mana bars full. Riot wanted to preserve her ability to heal while making her play more dynamic and risky, so they changed her healing spell to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">Cast From Hit Points</a> and gave her a health-regen mechanic with her Starcall ability. The damage is fairly weak until she builds AP (less than twice her regular attack damage), but it has a long range and is useful for poke. Soraka is still primarily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">The Medic</a>, but her need to attack and siphon off life from the enemy in order to do her job pushes her in the direction of this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfTheStorm">Heroes of the Storm</a></em> has an entire Healer class, many of which are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">The Medic</a>. However, every hero has access to two alternate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Heroics</a>, which for healers usually means one aggressive and one defensive. There are also a few healers who have more combat capabilities than others:
<ul><li> Rehgar is meant to be an aggressive frontliner, and puts out a fairly large amount of damage through basic attacks for a Healer. One of his heroics is Bloodlust, a powerful combat stim for himself and his team.
</li><li> Alextrasza has a strong fireball ability that slows and applies a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageOverTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageOverTime">Damage Over Time</a>, with a low cooldown. With good aim, she can pump out tonnes of damage with this one skill. And that's not including her trait, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">which lets her become a colossal dragon temporarily</a>. The main thing holding her back is her poor ability to heal herself.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk">Kharazim</a> is the closest thing to this trope by far. He effectively has the skillset of a melee assassin, but with a few healing abilities thrown in. His trait augments every third basic attack he lands with an effect, which can be modified at the start of the game - one option is healing an ally, but the others are bonus damage or mana gain and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CooldownManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CooldownManipulation">CDR</a> for himself. His heroics are a self-castable buff that prevents an ally from dying, or an AOE where he strikes nearby enemies for max health-based damage.
</li><li> Whitemane enforces this. She has horrible out-of-combat healing, but converts all damage she deals to enemies directly into healing for her team.

<ul><li> Regal fits the monk sub-type of this trope, but inverts the general concept by being a primarily melee-based character with just one tech tree of single-target healing spells.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Kratos and Zelos</a> can also learn three different healing spells regardless of their ability trees. They are not as effective as Raine, but they can provide some much needed relief when she's busy.
</li><li> Raine's spell selection consists primarily of healing and buff spells, but eventually she can learn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightEmUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightEmUp">Photon and either Ray or Holy Lance</a> to give her some offensive abilities as well. She also has access to Prism Stars and Gospel, two of the most powerful Unison Attacks in the game.

<ul><li> Tear has very potent healing spells that cover a wide area and can use Resurrection. However, her offensive spell pool is extremely powerful and she gains a unique accessory that easily makes her the best offensive spellcaster. Her melee artes are limited but have their uses, so she can easily go out on the offence.
</li><li> Natalia lacks offensive spells, but her healing and buffing is on point. She's limited to single-target healing outside of FOF changes, but in exchange her spells are usually faster than Tear's and restore the same amount of HP. FOF changes like Angel's Breath only make her better since she can even resurrect multiple characters at once. However, she is also a very quick and potent archer, so she has no problem sniping at people from afar while healing her own party.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfInnocence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfInnocence">Tales of Innocence</a></em>:

And she is not shy about performing some awesome melee combos with them, either.

<ul><li> Estelle is a healer who sports the highest defense scores in the game and a fast track to the protective skills. You could viably play her as the party tank and leave spot heals to your less proficient members, as she has an array of melee attacks to take advantage of. She's also no sap at supporting from the sidelines with her light based attack magic.
</li><li> Similarly Karol heals as well as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage">White Mage</a>, though his heals are limited to a small radius around him. He even obtains an arte that lets him remove status ailments!
</li><li> Raven is built for combat, having only a single move that heals for small amount. However, his sheer healing speed and efficiency compared to other characters with higher healing power, like Estelle, makes him the combat medic of choice for many players.
</li><li> Flynn is basically a more melee-oriented Estelle. He has strong offence and crowd control abilities, tanky skills that make it almost impossible for him to die while keeping everyone else safe, light spells to devastate his enemies and two healing spells straight out of Estelle's spell list in case you need to heal. A true Paladin through and through.

<ul><li> In the DS version, Hisui will be your only healer for quite a long time, so he gets First Aid, Cure (single-target) and Nurse (multi-target). He needs his sister in combat to access the more powerful area of effect healing in Fairy Circle, but is the only one who can use Resurrection.
</li><li> Kohaku gets the more powerful Heal (single target), Healing Circle and Revitalize (multi target) but tends to be slower than her brother. Her Raise Will has a chance of failure and may not actually resurrect a fallen party member. Things went a bit differently in R, so both siblings got to have area of effect spells and Resurrection.

<ul><li> Sophie's healing spells focus on single targets for more power and speed. She's also a martial artist who hits like a truck and has the most speed out of all the characters.
</li><li> Cheria's healing focuses on multiple targets for less power and less speed. Offensively she throws away the staff to focus entirely on throwing knives and uses powerful offensive magic including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoltOfDivineRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoltOfDivineRetribution">Indignation</a></em>.

</li><li> Leia heals single targets for greater power and can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff">raise the party's stats</a>.

Both girls can revive KO'd party members, and through the link-system can combine both their healing spells and offensive skills for far greater power than either is capable of alone.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfZestiria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfZestiria">Tales of Zestiria</a></em> has all of the seraphs fit to an extent since all of them have their two healing artes that have secondary effects and are still able to deal fight through attack and seraphic artes.
<ul><li> Mikleo's artes are single target but they have the effect boosting arte defense or curing poison and paralysis depending on the arte.
</li><li> Lailah's healing artes both restore SC while granting a boost to arte attack or healing burn.
</li><li> Dezel/Zaveid have artes that restore BG and increase focus or cure fatigue and increase speed.
</li><li> Edna can increase defense with her arte and she gets an area healing arte that also cures slow.

<ul><li> Eleanor and Eizen are the more physically oriented of the magic users while also being the ones who have access to the revival spells Life and Resurrection respectively.
</li><li> Magilou and Laphicet are more likely to be dedicated mages to fight but their physical attacks are nothing to disregard either. Magilou is the one who gets the area healing spells Healing Circle and Fairy Circle which is also capable of damaging enemies caught in the spell. Laphicet gets the single target healing spells First Aid and Elixir Vitae which also cures all status ailments.

The class is titular at best, as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsTryingToKillYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsTryingToKillYou">nature of series</a> largely does not allow for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifistRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifistRun">Pacifist Runs</a>, meaning you'll need some ability to kill enemies to succeed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall">Daggerfall</a></em> has stock <em>enemy</em> Healers, though they are one of the least encountered stock enemies in dungeons.
</li><li> As shown prominently in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">Nords</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">Proud Warrior Race</a> through and through, have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMagic">strong cultural dislike</a> for magic and magic users. The one exception they make is for Healers, as their way of life means that Skyrim always needs more Healers. Given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimUpNorth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimUpNorth">the dangers faced by simply living in Skyrim</a>, these Healers usually have the ability to defend themselves in some way.
</li></ul></li><li> An honorable mention is the Super Stimpak healing item of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> series. It restores about 75 damage but the user incurs 9 points of damage shortly thereafter. A popular assassination technique is to apply a large number of Super Stimpaks to a benign target and then wait for the cumulative damage to kill them.
<ul><li> Another honorable mention in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> series goes to the "Living Anatomy" Perk. Awarded when you have a high amount of "Doctor" skill, this perk gives you both a boost to said skill and a boost to <em>damage caused to living creatures</em>, since as someone intimately familiar with anatomy, you know where to aim to hit the vital points.
</li><li> One more goes to Arcade Gannon of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em>. Having him as a companion gives you the "Better Healing" perk, which increases the amount of health you gain from healing items. Combat-wise, he specializes in Energy weapons, one of the more powerful category of weapons in the series and if you complete his personal quest a certain way has his own suit of Enclave <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Tesla Armor</a>.
</li><li> In all Fallout games, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> can be one of these. A high Medicine skill, some combat skill maxed out (or very high in Fallout 1/2/Tactics).
</li></ul></li><li> Many of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> games either give you the option of mixing and matching classes to create these, or give healers flails, bows, or other weapons they can use from the safety of the back row so they can contribute <em>some</em> damage when not healing. And then, later in the game, there's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyHandGrenade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyHandGrenade">Holy</a> spell...
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII">Final Fantasy II</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter">Crutch Character</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage">Minwu</a> is obviously meant to be used as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">The Medic</a>, but since his MP total for that portion of the game is amazing, players often replace his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">Useless Useful Spells</a> with straight damage-dealing ones and unleash him on the enemies with decisive results. He's even more of a Combat Medic in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusLevelOfHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusLevelOfHeaven">Soul of Rebirth mode</a>, gaining access to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyHandGrenade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyHandGrenade">ultimate white magic Ultima</a>, calling him the most suited man to wield it. When powered up, Ultima will outdamage everything else in the game easily.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII">Final Fantasy III</a></em> has Sages. White Magic, Black Magic, <em>and</em> Summon Magic. Do the math. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3guve');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3guve" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3guve');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">MP is considerably limited.

TV Tropes claims no responsibility for any frustration or repeated clearing of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckPointStarvation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckPointStarvation">Crystal</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">Tower</a> when utilizing Combat Medic during gameplay. </span>
<ul><li> White Mages and their upgraded form, the Devout, are a bit more combat ready than they are in the rest of the series thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway">Aero series</a> of spells.
</li></ul></li><li> In both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em> the medic is also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic">summoner</a>.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em> also has a fair amount of customization, so Yuna, the starting white mage, can learn black magic spells as well (or you can buff her strength and make her a physical fighter). Works in reverse for other characters as well.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em>, Larsa has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal">Hyperspace Arsenal</a> of healing items in the normal game and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagic">White Magic</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a>, and he is liberal about using them, but is also a decent fighter.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em>, Monks beat enemies down with impressive strength, heal surrounding units' HP and MP, AND revive unconscious party members.
<ul><li> <em>Final Fantasy IX</em> takes it one step further with Amarant Coral. Half of Amarant's abilities center around subjecting the enemy to a variety of gruesome fates, while the other half center around healing and reviving fallen allies. He's also a formidable fighter on the front lines.
</li><li> Taken up another level if he goes into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Trance</a>. All of his abilities will now affect the <em>entire</em> side. This means he can totally cripple all enemies with his harmful abilities and his healing abilities can help everyone out at once.
</li></ul></li><li> Healer classes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> have several spells they can use to dish out damage, which is need when one is doing solo content. The Conjurer's Cleric Stance, which can also be used by other healers, can swap the healer's Mind (healing potency) and Intelligence (magic damage) stats around so that they can really dish out the pain.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> and Jerin in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaAndTheFortressOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaAndTheFortressOfDoom">Lufia &amp; The Fortress of Doom</a></em> share the best healing spells between them, but The Hero is also the second-hardest hitter while Jerin specializes in softening up multiple targets for the other members.
</li><li> Yurist in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaTheLegendReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaTheLegendReturns">Lufia: The Legend Returns</a></em> is one of the few characters who can use the full-party Champion healing spells, and can supplement healing with martial-arts IP attackss.
</li><li> The Priestess in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningSoul">Shining Soul 2</a></em> really is this trope. She is advertised in the manual as being someone who can't really take a few hits and this would make one think that playing the game with her is actually rather hard since you were probably the only person who'd own the game. Instead, she's actually more of a combat medic in that she handles decently with flails and can actually kill people who get too close to her if you ever found someone else to play multiplayer with you.
</li><li> This is fairly common through the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStar">Phantasy Star</a></em> series.
<ul><li> While Amy is your main healer, Rolf of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarII">Phantasy Star II</a></em> learns the low and medium-strength healing spells and can also cast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Rever</a>. Hugh is more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedMage">Red Mage</a>, but he can hold his own if properly equipped. Nei qualifies in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a> remake of the game, as she learns Nares there.
</li><li> A <em>lot</em> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarIII">Phantasy Star III</a></em> characters get access to Healing techniques and are excellent warriors on their own. Mieu is your first party member and remains in the party for the rest of the game, and depending on who you marry each generation, four of Rhys' sons and grandsons <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4039t');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4039t" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4039t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Ayn, Adan, Aron, and Sean</span> are all swordsmen with healing techs. And there's also Laya, Gwyn, Thea, and Kara.
</li><li> Rika from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarIV">Phantasy Star IV</a></em>. Though most of her spells are curative (and she may serve as the main healer depending on your party setup), she does a surprising amount of damage with her claws, and tends to move quickly as well. Rika's actually a little closer to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a> in that respect; her healing abilities are second only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage">Raja</a> and her damage output is roughly even with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Chaz</a> up until he gets the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Elsydeon</a>, her agility and dexterity are top notch, and because she equips heavy-type armor, her defense stays competitive for the entire game. Unlike many RPG healers, she mostly fills that role in combat simply because no one else can, and not because she's no good for anything else.
</li></ul></li><li> Many of these exist in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShiningSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShiningSeries">Shining Force</a></em>:
<ul><li> The most prominent example from the first game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningForce">Shining Force</a>: The Legacy of Great Intention,</em> is Gong, a monk: he can cast most of the healing spells that the traditional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">healers</a> eventually get access to, and with enough grinding, he can dish out as much damage as most of the regular melee fighters.
</li><li> The first game's remake, <em>Resurrection of the Dark Dragon,</em> adds Princess Narsha, who combines healing with raising status effects.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningForceIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningForceIII">Shining Force III</a></em> had priests that could become hilariously overpower due to the fact that they got 10exp every time they healed a character. Give that character a staff with a powerful in-built spell and watch as you wipe out the whole enemy with a Cleric. Also more offensive orientated characters learnt heal spells or got special equipment to allow healing.
</li></ul></li><li> Ryu in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFire">Breath of Fire III</a></em> is the game's primary healer. He is also the main character, and can double as a tank (although Garr and Momo are better used for this purpose.)
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireII">Breath of Fire II</a></em>'s Ryu was also one of that game's many healers — although roughly half the characters in that game could heal to some degree.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIV">Dragon Quest IV</a></em> acts like this early on, though they eventually grow into more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> who happens to have healing magic.
<ul><li> Cristo/Kiryl might fit the bill as well.
</li><li> Most of the main heroes of the game are able to do this, as they learn can learn healing magic.
</li><li> And in an older <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest">Dragon Quest</a></em> game, there is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloInsertNameHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloInsertNameHere">Princess of Moonbrook</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestII">Dragon Quest II</a></em>. She starts with a good healing spell, and does little melee damage, but soon learns a good attack spell.
</li><li> The Cleric from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIII">Dragon Quest III</a></em> can equip some decent armor, as well as wield some swords and has offensive wind magic. Later on, the Sage can do everything the Cleric can, as well as having offensive magic.
</li><li> Nevan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVI">Dragon Quest VI</a></em> learns better healing spells naturally than the rest of the party, but can also make use of flails that hit every enemy in a single group. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JobSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JobSystem">Job System</a> can let you make anyone you choose this.
</li><li> Despite the fact that his outfit and hair color are reminiscent of another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedMage">character archetype from another series</a>, Angelo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVIII">Dragon Quest VIII</a></em> fits, and in his case, it is more justified than the typical cleric character in that he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">Templar</a> (No, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">that kind</a>). Having him specialize in staffs or bows will cause him to lean more toward the "healer" side of things (focusing on spells or MP regeneration), but giving him a sword will produce a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a> / Combat Medic type character, since he can use the powerful Falcon Sword.
<ul><li> A better example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> himself. He can learn Heal, Midheal, Fullheal, and is the only character in the game who can learn the most powerful healing spell, Omniheal, if you raise his Courage stat high enough. He also has access to plenty of status recovery spells as well, such as Squelch and Tingle.
</li></ul></li><li> The vocation system in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX">Dragon Quest IX</a></em> - where you are pretty much encouraged to change vocations for the permanent stat benefits - can allow for a limited variation of this. At the least, you'd get Priest or Sage (classes with best healing spells) that is less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy</a> than normal.
</li><li> Serena in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestXI">Dragon Quest XI</a></em> can be this if you choose to invest in Spears, but in Part 2 she can also be this <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Veronica dies, having her gain all of her twin's offensive spells and the power to go with it</span>. Sylvando and Rab (if you choose to go into Claws for his weapon) are this by default.
<ul><li> As with <em>VIII</em>, the Hero is the straightest example. He can learn every healing spell except Multiheal, and unlike most of his predecessors also learns the best revival spell. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement">Sword of Plot Advancement</a> can cure all status effects when used from the item menu.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Marle, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em>, has the most and strongest healing spells in the group, but also learns a decent set of ice-based spells and techs. (Also inverted, nearly all the other characters learn a healing or status-affect spell).
<ul><li> Frog is probably a better example, since he has both effective healing techs and a sword that can do an appreciable amount of damage (especially when you get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Masamune</a>). Robo can also make a decent healer though he otherwise functions as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> character - with enough Magic Tabs, his Heal Beam can restore the entire party to full HP (or at least pretty close). There's also Ayla, who's healing tech is the only singe-tech capable of curing status effects.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTheSecondStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTheSecondStory">Star Ocean: The Second Story</a></em>, Opera focuses on fighting with guns, but her Healing Star killer move actually becomes powerful enough to allow you to remove Rena from your team. However, this means you will have to use items to revive fallen party members and cure status effects.
<ul><li> Rena herself is a competent fist-fighter and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightTheWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightTheWay">light magic user</a>. Her usefulness in a physical fight deteriorates as the game goes on though.
</li><li> Like Rena, Noel also is skilled at melee and healing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">at least on paper</a>. He becomes much more useful in the sequel, <em>Blue Sphere</em>, partly because his own abilities are much more effective, but also because he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter">the only healer available</a> until Opera and Rena join.
</li><li> Bowman Jeane is a certified pharmacist who kicks ass with bare fists. Oh, and he also has a self-healing killer move.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em>
<ul><li> For an old lady mage, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>' Wynne can be tough as hell. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">You can learn this first-hand if you bring her along for The Gauntlet and defile a sacred relic.</span> Additionally, if you choose the Spirit Healer specialization, a mage PC or Morrigan can also act the part.
</li><li> Anders in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">supposedly a talented healer</a>, but isn't quite as good as a specialist player. Mode shifting to offensive magic makes him less effective. He became much more effective once certain specialty accessories were made available in DLC.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em> removed in-combat healing spells to instead focus on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior">avoiding damage</a>. However, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Knight Enchanter's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Focus Spell</a> is the ultimate full party heal.
</li></ul></li><li> Meet <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>'s Mordin Solus. Doctor, scientist, field medic, safe sex advocate, former black ops, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDoctor">sharp shooter</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">light foes on fire</a> with omni-tool, once killed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">krogan</a></em> with farming equipment. *<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic">inhale</a>*. Don't provoke.
<ul><li> In the first game, the 'first aid' and 'medicine' skills were on you or your party members, who all actively fight. The medicine skill in particular you a Neural Shock to deal with organic enemies. It went even farther by allowing an Engineer or Sentinel class Shepard to get the Medic Specialization. Among Shepard's comrades, the only party member with access to the Medicine talent was Kaidan Alenko, otherwise the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a>.

</li><li> The Geth Engineer and the N7 Demolisher are the only units in multiplayer that have a way of instantly restoring theirs as well as their allies' shields, via the Geth Turret (former) and Supply Pylon (latter).

</li><li> The Medic class acts like this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlienSwarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlienSwarm">Alien Swarm</a></em>. They can use almost any weapon other classes can (assuming they are not class exclusive weapons), whether it be a flamethrower or a shotgun.
</li><li> The Defender classes in <em>Super <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MondayNightCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MondayNightCombat">Monday Night Combat</a></em> are a combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEngineer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEngineer">The Engineer</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">The Medic</a>, and as such they use healing guns to fix up allies while their turrets fend off enemies. Leo is the standout here — while his turret's not very impressive, his Mona Laser's healing power is charged by doing damage to enemies. At full charge it can heal most classes from near-death to full health, and since it heals the whole team no matter where they are, it can turn the tide of the match (or at least a team fight).
<ul><li> The other two Defender classes, the Support and the Combatgirl, can use the altfire on their heal/hurt guns to, uh, hurt enemies rather than heal allies, but this isn't very efficient without upgrades.

</p><ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FrontMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FrontMission">Front Mission</a></em> franchise, this first emerges in the USN scenario of the remake <em>Front Mission 1st</em>, made into an official class in <em>4</em>, and further seen in <em>Online</em>, <em>2089</em>, <em>5</em>, and <em>Evolved</em>. Certain wanzer builds (i.e. Giza, Eldos) are heavily armored and have power output high enough to mount repair backpacks, allowing them to repair damaged friendlies and stay alive long enough to return fire. Front Mission 5 further refines this with Mechanic specialists, who have skillsets that enhance the effectiveness of repairs - Hector Reynolds, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass">Colonel Badass</a> in charge of Delta Force's expy, is a Combat Medic.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JaggedAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JaggedAlliance">Jagged Alliance</a></em>, mercenaries with medical skills are quite commonplace. Their roles? Not constantly pumping hit points to other mercs, but treating their wounds and stopping them from bleeding to death. When the mercs are resting, they can use their doctoring skill to bolster the regeneration rate of those within the same sector. All of them have high wisdom stats which help them to learn new skills faster, and because of this eventually become ass kickers if they survive long enough in the battlefield. Most of them are expert melee combatants thanks to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDoctor">familiarity with scalpels</a>. That said, medics whose marksmanship are on par with the most expensive mercs are very few.
<ul><li> It's also rare to find a regular mercenary who doesn't have at least <em>some</em> skill-points in Medicine; not enough to be all that useful in the "Doctor" role out of combat, but sufficient to perform emergency first-aid for a wounded comrade if the actual Medic is too far away.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MakaiKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MakaiKingdom">Makai Kingdom</a></em> has a "Medic" class with the same healing and buff abilities as the Cleric class of the same game, but with better defense and the ability to use guns at the expense of a lower INT growth. In addition to standard weapons, both classes also have access to the Syringe weapon class, which can both heal and do damage with attacks based on RES, the same stat that powers healing magic.
</li><li> Clerics from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea">Disgaea</a></em> are straight-up Medics if you just level them the standard way.

Conversely, you can give <em>anyone</em> a cleric as an apprentice to teach them healing spells. The other elemental spells may be useless if you have no staff and/or poor INT because they'll have short range and do less damage than regular attacks, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealThyself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealThyself">self-healing</a> is always useful.
</li><li> Mages of Light in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleForWesnoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleForWesnoth">Battle for Wesnoth</a></em>. They're strong in ranged casting, especially against magical creatures and the undead, and fairly decent in melee for a unit which mainly heals and (with its light aura) buffs its allies. A chaotic-alignment enemy that tries to attack the Mage will also have its damage reduced at night or evening by having to stand in that same aura.
<ul><li> Pretty much any unit with healing abilities in <em>Battle for Wesnoth</em>, really. The game basically <em>has</em> no non-combat medics; even the comparatively lowly Elvish Shaman and Saurian Augur have useful attack powers and the motivation to use them (to earn XP and advance, of course, just like other units).
</li></ul></li><li> The Cleric and other races' equivalents thereof in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfWonders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfWonders">Age of Wonders</a></em> is a capable combat unit in addition to their healing abilities, to the point that it's debatable whether they're medics who can fight, or mystical warriors with healing on the side. While their actual attack and defense values are usually low, they have a useful magical ranged attack, and infuse their melee strikes with magical (or elemental, depending on the race) energy to strike hard. They're especially useful against pesky units with high defense or are flat-out resistant or immune to physical damage.

You can promote Clerics and Priests into Valkyries and Sages too, but Bishops are often much-needed as monsters become the primary enemies. In general, most promoted magic classes can usually both heal and fight.

<ul><li> Mist stands out for being able to wield Swords as her secondary weapon, unlike most other healers in the franchise. Indeed, she is one of the few characters who is both able to wield a sword and has a top-notch Magic stat; in <em>Path of Radiance</em>, once you give her the Wind Edge (a sword that deals damage based on Magic instead of the normal Strength stat) and promote her to a horse-riding Valkyrie, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">she becomes quite a force to be reckoned with</a> (unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug">this was changed</a> in <em>Radiant Dawn</em>).
</li><li> Princess Elincia also has an exceptional magic stat and the ability to use swords in addition to healing staves, with extra mobility to boot. Unlike Mist, Elincia's return in <em>Radiant Dawn</em> saw a very minor drop in her healing abilities accompanied by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> level boost to her combat skills.

As a result most combat medics, including the main character, Usato, are far stronger than the rest of their country's soldiers.

</li><li> PJ's (Pararescue, also "Pedros", US Air Force Special Forces that specialize in search in rescue and medevac) <a class="urllink" href="http://www.michaelyon-online.com/pedros.htm">serving in Afghanistan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> are known to willingly forgo Geneva Convention protections because painting a large Red Cross on your unarmed helicopter just draws fire from enemies who know said 'copter is unarmed. Their alternate solution? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunshipRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunshipRescue">They like to ride in helicopters</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood">armed with dual miniguns</a>. There are several other special forces groups that do the same thing as PJ's, and they are often in their respective country's air force. A couple examples are Israel's unit 669 and Brazil's Para-SAR.
</li><li> The only branch of the United States military that does not train their own medics is the Marine Corps; instead, they are assigned Navy Hospital Corpsmen, who are referred to as "Doc" and given great respect. This is because, in addition to their Field Medical Training classes, they are required to pass all aspects of the Marine Physical Fitness test. In other words, they have to be able to run 3 miles in less than half an hour, perform at least 50 sit-ups in two minutes, know how to fire and service a rifle, all while learning how to save a Marine's life. Is it any wonder that the rating of Hospital Corpsman is the most decorated in the US Navy?
<ul><li> Marine training is even harder on the attached Corpsman than the rest of the Marine recruits. A Corpsman is required to carry a full pack like everybody else as well as their own medical supply kit which isn't exactly light. To make things harder, whenever recruits get a few minutes to rest on a particularly gruesome run or field exercise the Corpsman is expected to check on all of the recruits assigned to him for injuries (especially foot injuries).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Tends to happen in any situation where one or both sides do not respect the red cross symbol. Notable historical examples include the German and Russian armies in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WW2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WW2">WW2</a> towards each other, and US medics in the Pacific theater.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassIsraeli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassIsraeli">The Israeli Army</a> takes this trope to its logical conclusion with an ambulance that is also a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryMashupMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryMashupMachine">tank</a></em>.
<ul><li> Also carried over to the civilian world with <a class="urllink" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/MDA_Armoured_Ambulance.jpg">this ambulance<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> from Magen David Adom (Red Star of David), Israel's answer to the Red Cross.

</li><li> Most armies have a special forces medical division trained to rescue soldiers (in particular, shot-down pilots) behind enemy lines. Think medic + commando.
<ul><li> Many Special forces medic can even perform a variety of minor surgeries in the field to save your life and treat a very broad range of injuries and ailments.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLawsAndCustomsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLawsAndCustomsOfWar">The Laws and Customs of War</a> dictate that in order to hold noncombatant status and be entitled to bear the Red Cross, hospital ships must be totally unarmed, even purely defensive systems like Phalanx CIWS being forbidden. This has presented something of a problem in modern times, as the Red Cross means nothing to a guided missile that misses its intended target and locks onto the first ship it sees. As a result, the Royal Navy, who learned the "indiscriminate missiles" lesson the hard way when the <em>Atlantic Conveyor</em> was sunk during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFalklandsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFalklandsWar">The Falklands War</a>, has bit the bullet and fitted its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">"Primary Casualty Reception Ship"</a> RFA <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFA_Argus_%28A135%29">Argus<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> with a couple of point-defence guns.
</li><li> Several countries and their respective branches of service, including for example the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YanksWithTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YanksWithTanks">United States Army</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi">Marine Corps</a>, issue the majority of their soldiers with at least a bare minimum of first aid supplies (and training), so that every soldier can apply this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">just in case</a>.

When his medical tent was getting swarmed with Japanese soldiers, he drove back the attackers and covered his unit's escape with a machine gun. As he gave his life for his brothers in arms, he managed to take 98 of the enemy with him.

While being the only Russian nurse awarded with Order of Florence Nightingale and saving more than 300 soldiers during WWII, as a medical officer of the Marine corps she fought on par with her comrades. For example, during the recapture of Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, not only she rescued 17 wounded from the battlefield but single-handedly assaulted a fortified German position, taking 14 prisoners and killing 10 enemies in the process.

</li><li> An interesting story from World War II came from a misinterpretation of this trope: Switzerland, who remained neutral during the war, nonetheless detained any planes, Allied or Axis, who crossed their lines seeking refuge. Most of the time, these were Allied bombers who had sustained too much damage in battle to make it back to base, and instead opted to land in Switzerland where they would be treated better than as P.O.W.'s by the Germans. Some Swiss pilots tasked with escorting these bombers to airbases were surprised at how compliant the crews of these B-17s and B-24s were to being approached by unknown fighters, especially when the Swiss Air Force tended to fly <em>Axis</em> aircraft that they had either confiscated and repaired or simply bought from the Germans, such as the Bf-109, with the only identifying marks on them being the Swiss military emblem.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0mrg9');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0mrg9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0mrg9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A white cross on a red background</span> When a Swiss pilot finally managed to ask an American detainee about this oddity, the American pilot responded that, while yes they were a bit leery of being approached by Bf-109's, they wouldn't <em>dare</em> fire upon a plane operated by the Red Cross!<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1dazv');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1dazv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1dazv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Red Cross' emblem being a, well, red cross on a white background.</span>
