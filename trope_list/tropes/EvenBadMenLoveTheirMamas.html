<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuperBroly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuperBroly">Dragon Ball Super: Broly</a></em> it is astoundingly shown that even a short-tempered genocidal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">Bad Boss</a> like Frieza cannot bring himself to even <em>raise his voice</em>, much less vaporize his lady in attendant Berryblue, for warmly teasing him about his height, but instead affectionately confides his insecurities to her with <em>absolute</em> sincerity. Since she is shown in the prologues to have being by his side since childhood (before he overtook Planet Vegeta, in fact), Berryblue is all but implied to be Frieza's childhood nanny. As the closest thing he has to a mother, it's only natural that she would be the one person that he would genuinely love, and dare to be sincere and vulnerable to.
</li><li> In the same movie Raditz (yes <em>that</em> Raditz) was very respectful towards Gine, calling her "mom" despite Saiyans supposedly having no concept of family, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">apparently</a> Gine was very proud of Raditz becoming Vegeta's partner. <em>Dragon Ball Minus</em> also implies Gine messaged Raditz about Goku traveling to Earth, meaning Raditz might've gone to retrieve his brother on her orders. It's also notable that despite Raditz not getting along with his father Bardock when they meet in games, Raditz has nothing bad to say about Gine.
</li></ul></li><li> This concept is explored some in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>.
<ul><li> Kurama, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kitsune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kitsune">a fox-spirit</a>, fused with his human mother's still unborn child to continue his existence after nearly being killed. He planned to leave and continue his criminal ways once he regained his demonic powers, but found that he had come to love his human mother (Shiori) too much to abandon her, and was even willing to give up his life to save her from an illness. He's willing to give up your life, too, if you threaten her safety in any way.
</li><li> At the beginning of the series, Yusuke is killed in a car accident through some grand cosmic accident: he performed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> a delinquent like him was never expected to do, but his sacrifice was also an unnecessary one. As he is told in the afterlife: even had he not intervened, the car about to strike a young child who had wandered into the street would have swerved out of the way at the last moment. Because he has died both unexpectedly and needlessly, the bureaucratic afterlife offers him a chance to be restored to life, but the apathetic and bitter Yusuke isn't even sure he wants his life back. He decides to take the chance after all when he attends his own wake and sees his mother is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InelegantBlubbering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InelegantBlubbering">a miserable wreck, sobbing uncontrollably.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Lelouch Lamperouge aka Lelouch Vi Brittania, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, has as one of his motives to uncover the truth behind the <em>really</em> messy death of Marianne "The Flash" Lamperouge aka Marianne Vi Britannia, his beloved mother. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When he learns that she is alive (albeit, as a "spirit" of sorts) and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a> she concocted with his father, he kills both of them, not only to stop the plan altogether but as revenge for abandoning him and Nunnally in a war zone to move that plan forward.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>:
<ul><li> Jotaro travels all the way to Egypt, enduring constant attacks by enemy Stand users, and then faces off with a time-stopping vampire, all to save his mother Holly. Jotaro's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> personality prevents him from ever really admitting that he loves his mother, but his actions speak volumes to her, as she has always has had faith in his inner kindness, and in the end, she was right.
</li><li> It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood">In the Blood</a>: in Part 2, Jotaro's grandfather Joseph was brash and prone to picking fights, but even he feared reprisal from his grandmother Erina after accidentally using his Hamon to fire a bottle cap at a corrupt constable's finger and snapping it, and he becomes quite cross with people who upset her.
</li><li> Believe it or not, <strong>Dio Brando himself</strong> counts. In Part 1, he harbors a fierce anger towards his father Dario because, according to Dio in his own words, he "made [my] Mother suffer", and he said this to Jonathan when he could have just said that he made <em>him</em> suffer. He cried <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears">Manly Tears</a> when his father ordered him to sell his mother's old dress for booze. And shortly before becoming a vampire, Dio fought a duo of drunk <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> vagrants <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMom">because they insulted his mother</a>. Of course, it is possible he stopped caring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranshumanTreachery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranshumanTreachery">after turning into a vampire</a>, but it is quite surprising that, at least at one point, someone like Dio could have loved his mother, maybe even to the point of her death being his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a>.
</li><li> <em>Steel Ball Run</em> is even more explicit about this trope with Diego Brando, who actually gets a backstory with his mother. Unfortunately, this Mrs. Brando died from being mistreated and neglected at the farm, causing him to become vengeful and power-hungry.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>, despite August repeatedly claiming not to understand the love between a parent and child, he ultimately ceases his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">suicide attack</a> because he sees his mother suffering from it in the distance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>:
<ul><li> Youkai leaderess Abi-hime's main motivation to strike a deal with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Naraku was to get the human blood she needed to save the life of her mother, Queen Tekkei, who was not only old but also was poisoned after defeating and eating an ogre. Granted, she's not portrayed as sympathetic and the mother is a giant bird youkai, but Abi's devotion to her mother is still noticeable.
</li><li> Inuyasha <em>himself</em> enters into this territory in the beginning of the series. At this point, he's still a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> and very much an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> (before his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> occurs). Despite all this, he is shown to truly cherish his memories of his dead mother, despite Kagome assuming he resents her for being human. In fact, Inuyasha's love for his mother is what causes Sesshomaru to use her form to discover the secret of Tessaiga from Inuyasha.
</li><li> Downplayed with Sesshoumaru, who's a jerk to anyone, but when he turns to his <em>mother</em> for help to master his sword, she gives him a somewhat unempathetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieOrFly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieOrFly">Die or Fly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty">lesson</a> in the value of compassion, the key to mastering Tenseiga, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">he seems to respect her</a> even with all she put him through.

</li><li> In the third entry in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSellswords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSellswords">The Sellswords</a></em> by R. A. Salvatore, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller">Artemis Entreri</a> returns to his hometown of Memnon in Calimshan and butchers the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch">corrupted priesthood of Selûne</a> who made his life hell as a child.

</li><li> One of the major unanswered questions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WeNeedToTalkAboutKevin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WeNeedToTalkAboutKevin">We Need to Talk About Kevin</a></em> is what Kevin (a school shooter who seemed to deliberately cultivate the image of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">The Sociopath</a>) really felt towards his parents. Despite seeming to have tried from infancy to make his mother, Eva, as miserable as possible, even if it hurt him too, many of his actions could be interpreted as a <em>phenomenally</em> twisted means of trying to bond with her in his own way. His relationship with his father is also quite difficult to fathom, as he hid his sociopathy from him and played the perfect son, and years later Eva still can't tell if Kevin was trying to hurt her by causing her husband to mistrust her when she tried to tell him that Kevin was seriously disturbed, or whether Kevin was trying to please his father by concealing what he truly was, or was actually showing some sort of respect for Eva by letting her see his true self. She is also unsure as to whether Kevin's reaction to his father being completely taken in by the charade was simple contempt for his stupidity or emotional pain that his father clearly loved the mask and never tried to look past it. The best example of this ambiguity is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">before he started the school shooting, he killed his father and his little sister (who hero-worshipped him,) while leaving his mother alive.

The fact that Kevin is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateLiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateLiar">Consummate Liar</a> and Eva is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a> makes it even more difficult to form conclusions.

<ul><li> Can even an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonLordsAndArchdevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonLordsAndArchdevils">Archdevil</a>, a ruler of Hell who is, for all practical purposes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfEvil">Made of Evil</a>, show love for her mother? If the case of Glasya, the ruler of the sixth layer of Hell in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> cosmology, definitely. Her mother was the consort of Asmodeus, the Overlord of Hell (her father, naturally), who was murdered by Levistus, the ruler of the fifth layer of Hell centuries ago (a treasonous crime that caused Levistus to become both the ruler and a prisoner of his domain). It's no secret that Glasya utterly despises Levistus for the death of her mother, and one of her biggest goals since becoming ruler of her own layer is revenge, possibly by finding enough evidence of Levistus' treachery (or planting some) to convince her father to eradicate him completely.
<ul><li> Another extreme example from this cosmology is Bahgtru, the orcish god of strength and the son of Gruumsh, the chief god of the orcs. Bahgtru is known for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">being incredibly stupid</a>, but he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">Undying Loyalty</a> towards his father; and one source claims he has even <em>greater</em> loyalty towards his mother, Luthic. (Given that orcs tend to be misogynistic as a species, and Luthic is willingly submissive to her husband, that's <em>really</em> saying something.)
</li><li> Similarly, books have suggested that Luthic is the second-most revered deity of the orc pantheon since she's the goddess of motherhood and therefore the thing that keeps the orc hordes going.

</li><li> Bart Simpson is proud to be America's Bad Boy, but he really does love his mom Marge. Examples:
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGEpisode">RPG Episode</a> where he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkLord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkLord">Dark Lord</a> and, despite her being incredibly annoying and ruining his image as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a>, he protected his mother's character from goblins and revived her.
</li><li> Then there's the real world where he's willing to defend Marge from an Ultimate Martial Artist.
</li><li> In "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire," Bart asks his parents for a tattoo for Christmas and Marge said no. Later, Bart gets a tattoo with "MOTHER" written on a heart, hoping it would flatter her. (It didn't, logically.)
</li><li> In "Hurricane Neddy", after Ned Flanders, of all people, lashes out at Marge, Bart immediately jumps to his mom's defense: "Hey, back off, man!"
</li><li> He also knows when his antics go too far when they upset her.

</li></ul></li><li> A variant: in "I Don't Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings," the criminal Dwight's problems seem to stem largely from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">being abandoned by his mother</a> as a child.

</li><li> Averted with Mr. Burns. He never forgave his mother after her affair with President Taft. On the other hand, he does get <em>very angry</em> with Homer later in the same episode for impersonating her, and at Smithers for putting him up to it.
</li><li> Whether Krusty counts as "bad" or not is subjective, but he does seem to have a soft spot for his mom. In "Krusty Gets Kanceled" when it is revealed that Luke Perry is his "worthless half-brother" whom he hates, Perry convinces him to let him have a part on his special "for mom's sake". (Of course, he's close to his formerly estranged father too, the entire plot of "Like Father, Like Clown" dealing with that.)
</li><li> Continuity regarding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully">Nelson's</a> parents tends to vary, but he does tend to at least respect his mom.
