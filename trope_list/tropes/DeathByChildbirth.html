Many such stories have a beautiful death that just results in the mother kissing her husband and baby goodbye. Writers often forget about the screaming, the bleeding, the fever, and the way that this agony could go on for <em>days</em>, and such writers either don't know this or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NauseaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NauseaFuel">just can't stomach it</a>. It should be noted that some deaths in childbirth are pretty fast  a woman with uterine atony can hemorrhage to death in minutes without emergency medical intervention, but that's a <em>lot</em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverdrawnAtTheBloodBank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverdrawnAtTheBloodBank">blood</a>.

His father Fuyuki buried himself in his work and ignored his children in his grief, and the emotionally-scarred Natsumi abused Akito atrociously because she blamed him for both their mother's death and their father's neglect.

This may be justified by first generation space colonists having poor health due to excessive exposure to cosmic radiation &amp; microgravity.
</li><li> According to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em> manga <em>Episode Zero</em>, Quatre Raberba Winner's mother Quatrina died giving birth to him, determined to both have a child by natural ways and give his father a son after his last twenty-nine test-tube children were all girls, though she <em>knew</em> beforehand that it would cost her her life since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">her body was not fit for bearing children</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HajimeNoIppo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HajimeNoIppo">Hajime no Ippo</a></em>, Takeshi Sendoh's grandmother explains to Fujii's assistant Mari Iizuka that her daughter-in-law died shortly after giving birth to him. It's not clear if Mrs. Sendoh died as a direct consequence of giving birth or it was just a coincidence, though.
</li><li> This was how Marik Ishtar's mother died in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>.

Gaara was a match and the Shukaku was sealed while he was in the womb, but Gaara was born extremely premature as a result. Karura was already very weakened by the childbirth itself, and she soon died.
</li><li> Sakumo Hatake's beloved wife died when she gave birth to their son Kakashi, whom Sakumo tried to raise as well as he could until he had to commit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seppuku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seppuku">seppuku</a> a few years later.
</li></ul></li><li> The manga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PetShopOfHorrors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PetShopOfHorrors">Pet Shop of Horrors</a></em> has Christopher falling mute upon learning from an angry cousin that he "killed his own mom."

Justified in that Hiromi was said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">to have been sickly all her life</a>, couldn't conceive naturally, <em>and</em> couldn't give birth without a C-Section.

<ul><li> Niche's mother didn't survive childbirth either, probably due to complications such as her own poor health at the time, giving birth to twins, and that her children <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl">were not normal humans</a>.

In a twist, the readers find out that Mrs. Ushiro was <em>not</em> Jun's mother, just his aunt (and in the manga, they weren't related at all, she was just the wife of his birth mom's teacher). His biological mom is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">actually Captain Misumi Tanaka, the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>.</span> And she also dies, though not through childbirth.

Her son, Bowser Jr, is born unusually small and was born alive, unlike full koopas who hatch from eggs. Bowser keeps the birth from Peach out of fear, causing her to believe Bowser found another lover after she mysteriously fell ill. It isn't until Jr is three that Peach learns what really happened.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>, Padme dies within minutes (if not SECONDS!) of giving birth to Luke and Leia since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByDespair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByDespair">"she's lost the will to live"</a> and, you know, <em>raise her children</em> because the father is an asshole. A lot of fans have different theories of other factors that could have contributed to her death since the stated reason in the film is often seen as an example of George Lucas's bad writing, but none of them are confirmed.
<ul><li> It doesn't help that she was choked by the dark side of the Force, was unconscious during Obi-Wan and Anakin's fight, and probably had to go into premature labor (not to mention the fact that she then had to deliver decently sized TWINS 100 percent naturally. OUCH!).
<ul><li> It's also worth noting that the (albeit now non-canonical) junior novelization outright states that she sustained lethal tracheal injuries from the force choke- which the med droids failed to pick up on due to being programmed by non-humanoids who had basically zero contact with humans (or humanoid species). There's also a passage where Obi-Wan, upon hearing that Padme has "lost the will to live" and that the med droids "don't know why", thinks "I know why. Anakin has broken her heart" suggesting that Padme's death was essentially a combination of force choke injuries AND <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByDespair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByDespair">Death by Despair</a>.

This causes Luke, Leigh's husband, to resent Heaven for "killing" the woman he loved. The circumstances of her conception (Leigh was raped by her stepfather) don't help much either.
<ul><li> Also the fate of Gabriel(le) Landry in the Landry series, and Lillian's mother in the Cutler series. The Cutler series also contains a subversion: Jed Booth pretends that his wife Georgia died as a result of complications from Charlotte's birth when Georgia really died from stomach cancer several days previously. This is to hide the fact that Charlotte is Lillian's daughter and the result of Jed raping her.
</li><li> This is a plot point in <em>Daughter of Darkness</em>, where Lorelei discovers that she and all her "adoptive" sisters are her father's biological children—he impregnates his daughters, they die in childbirth, and the babies grow up to be beautiful young women who lure new victims to the house for him (he is a vampire.)

<ul><li> Strongly implied, but not exactly stated, in the case both of David's mother Clara, after she gives birth to David's unnamed baby half-brother, and of his first wife Dora. This parallel is probably meant to emphasize the similarities between the two characters, and in both cases the baby dies, too. These two examples are more realistic than many, as neither woman dies immediately after the birth, but both decline slowly over the next several weeks, similar to the Real Life example of Jane Seymour.

She dies during the birth of their second and third children, Leto Atreides II (not to be confused with Leto II, their unfortunate older brother, who was killed in a Harkonnen raid) and Ghanima. Chani's death is known to Paul and others via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">prescience</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">Face-dancers</a> actively try to profit from this, by offering Paul the chance/compromise/ devil's bargain to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues">clone</a> Chani, which he just barely manages to refuse). This death is caused, or at the very least escalated, by the fact that Princess Irulan (Paul's legal wife, daughter of the deposed emperor, and Bene Gesserit, to name just a few) has been feeding Chani contraceptives for some 12 years for rather obvious political reasons (and because the Bene Gesserit did not want their millennia-long genetic project getting contaminated by the wildcard that was Chani's bloodline, and would have liked to ensure that Paul had children with someone more suitable, like Irulan, whom they could manipulate). According to Paul, Chani's death during childbirth was far less painful and cruel compared to her possible future fates had she survived.

The second birth is extremely easy—until the midwife, on orders from court magician and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Flagg, makes a small incision that causes the queen to bleed to death, unknown to anyone. The fact that she had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentAdorationRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentAdorationRating">100% Adoration Rating</a> only strengthens the second son, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">Thomas</a>, in his belief that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaternalDeathBlameTheChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaternalDeathBlameTheChild">nobody in the kingdom likes him</a> for anything but "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedSuccessor">throne insurance</a>."

Surprisingly common for the more important characters.
<ul><li> Daenerys' backstory, her mother the queen dies after giving birth to her. It's justified by being a particularly difficult birth. Dany is born as the royal family was fleeing from "usurper" Robert Baratheon's assassins.
</li><li> Tyrion's backstory; Tyrion's deformities lead to complications in labor and she dies.
</li><li> It is hinted that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lyanna Stark</span> might have died in childbirth.

Of course, this comes up in certain theories about Jon Snow's parents (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">specifically, that Lyanna is his mother and Prince Rhaegar is his father</span>) and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretLegacy">Secret Legacy</a>.

Fewer than half are "normal"
<ul><li> Lord Fax effectively raped Lady Gemma into premature labor, with the intention of killing her in childbirth. He's then goaded into renouncing Ruatha in favor of her issue, giving Lessa the opportunity to arrange a duel in which he's killed. To Lessa's chagrin, Gemma <em>does</em> give live birth despite dying, and the resulting boy, Jaxom, becomes crucial to Pern's future.
</li><li> This was the fate of Larna, the mother of weyrleader F'lar. This fact is not revealed until toward the end of the series, when <em>The Masterharper of Pern</em> shows the life story of Masterharper Robinton and fills in many story gaps. (F'lar's father, F'lon, was the Masterharper's best boyhood friend.)
</li><li> F'lon mentions that his own mother died giving birth to him.
</li><li> Lessa, F'lar's Weyrmate and Weyrwoman of Benden Weyr, almost died giving birth to their only son F'lessan. It's implied that the complications from the difficult birth combined with the toll that frequent trips <em>between</em> have on human physiology have made her infertile. F'lar was so terrified by Lessa's brush with death that he actually doesn't want Lessa to get pregnant again.
</li></ul></li><li> In the book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Wicked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Wicked">Wicked</a></em>, Elphaba's mother dies after giving birth to the girls' younger brother, Shell. In the play, she dies while giving birth to her younger sister Nessarose, thanks to severe birth defects and poisoning.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sabriel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sabriel">Sabriel</a></em> opens with the protagonist Sabriel's mother dying giving birth to her.
</li><li> Done with the main character Amir in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKiteRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKiteRunner">The Kite Runner</a></em>. However, his dad doesn't blame him for it at all.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeanKoontz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeanKoontz">Dean Koontz</a> uses this several times:
<ul><li> <em>From the Corner of His Eye</em> takes it to ridiculous levels of tragedy. The lovely strict Catholic teenage girl gets horribly raped by the antagonist—who thinks they're role-playing—and hides the pregnancy from her family until she gets a brain aneurysm from all the wrapping up her stomach and dies horribly, giving birth to a kid who gets adopted by her sister in a show of bottomless compassion. And that's just the beginning...
</li><li> <em>Life Expectancy</em>: Natalie Beezo dies giving birth, and Maddie Tock has a close call.
</li><li> <em>Lightning</em>: Laura's birth is fatal to mother Janet. Laura herself has a very difficult delivery with her own child, and will not be able to have another.
</li></ul></li><li> Mrs. Richard F. Schiller of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lolita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lolita">Lolita</a></em> dies in childbirth. Of course, it's not until the end of the book that we learn that she is actually... the eponymous Dolores "Lolita" Haze herself.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Voldemort's</a> mother, Merope Gaunt, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a>.</em> It's noted that she could have saved herself with magic, but after her husband left her she basically wanted to die, leaving Voldemort to be raised at a Muggle orphanage.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarAndPeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarAndPeace">War and Peace</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep">little princess</a> dies giving birth to Prince Andrei's only son.
</li><li> Cathy I in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WutheringHeights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WutheringHeights">Wuthering Heights</a></em> dies just after giving birth to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyJunior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyJunior">Cathy II</a>, having been severely weakened by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainFever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainFever">Brain Fever</a>, though this isn't played for Gothic family romance laughs. Interestingly, <em>Wuthering Heights</em> was (famously) not written by a man, but rather a motherless woman herself.
</li><li> Quite possibly because Witches also act as Midwives, this is a rare occurrence in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sourcery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sourcery">Sourcery</a></em>, Coin's mother dies of a heart attack while giving birth to him. Lady Sybil Vimes comes close to dying in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld">Night Watch</a></em>, and Rincewind's mother is said (in defiance of all logic) to have run away before he was born. Granny Weatherwax making a difficult decision (because she couldn't expect anyone else to make it) at the start of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CarpeJugulum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CarpeJugulum">Carpe Jugulum</a></em>.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nation">Nation</a></em>, Daphne's mother dies giving birth. Her father's reaction to this is part of the reason for her being stuck on the island, and her dealing with it is a part of the plot, dealt with in a very touching scene.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinMcKinley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinMcKinley">Robin McKinley</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BeautyARetellingOfBeautyAndTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BeautyARetellingOfBeautyAndTheBeast">Beauty</a></em> and her "The Twelve Dancing Princesses", the heroines are motherless because their mother died in childbirth; in both cases, the baby also died. The author used this trope again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroAndTheCrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroAndTheCrown">The Hero and the Crown</a>,</em> combining it with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByDespair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByDespair">Death by Despair</a>—Aerin's mother was said to have "turned her face to the wall and died," upon giving birth to a girl instead of a boy.
</li><li> The title character in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AstridLindgren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AstridLindgren">Astrid Lindgren</a>'s <em>Mio, my Mio</em> was placed at an orphanage as a baby after his mother died at childbirth. This was common practice in Lindgren's native Sweden in the early 20th century, due to the idea that a man couldn't raise children without the help of a woman. Mio's adoptive parents wanted a girl, but there were only boys available, making him an unwanted adopted child. Lucky for Mio, his real father has been searching for him ever since his birth, and finally finds him and brings him home to the Land of Faraway, where the father is king. The book gives a beautiful description of parent and child being separated when the child is an infant and reunited later, likely inspired by the fact that Lindgren herself had to place her firstborn child in foster care during his first years of life.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a>: Breaking Dawn</em>. Bella dies during her extremely difficult labour, but she doesn't die-die. She survives Renesmee's birth... by being turned into a vampire.

Little Remedios, Colonel Aureliano Buendía's teenaged wife, dies when her already risky pregnancy with twins takes a turn for the worse. Later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">Amaranta Úrsula</a> perishes after she gives birth to the last Aureliano... the son of her nephew and lover Aureliano Babilonia Buendía.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShadowOfTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShadowOfTheWind">The Shadow of the Wind</a></em>, Julian Carax, author of the eponymous book, has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a> after his lover dies in childbirth (the child dies also). He never knew that the reason her family allowed her to die was that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestIsRelative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestIsRelative">she was his sister</a>.
</li><li> Míriel in Tolkien's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em> dies of weariness after giving birth to her son Fëanor, saying "[never] again shall I bear child; for strength that would have nourished the life of many has gone forth into Fëanor." (Indeed.) Kind of an interesting case in that she doesn't die immediately as a result of medical complications; she survives for at least a short time until, while wandering in Lorien's gardens, she basically falls into an eternal sleep.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesSwallow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesSwallow">James Swallow</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BloodAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BloodAngels">Blood Angels</a></em> novel <em>Deus Sanguinius</em>, after Inquisitor Stele attacked Rafen's mind to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">drive him to suicide</a>, Rafen remembers all the deaths in his life.

<ul><li> Women in the <em>Pendragon</em> RPG have an extremely high chance of suffering this; it's actually the most common cause of death, at least for female PCs. The system is also fairly misogynistic, reflecting many 'medieval values,' so childbirth is pretty much a female PC's main duty unless they're very inventive with their character. At least one such PC made it her life's goal to avoid getting married and pregnant, just to avoid this.

For mystical reasons that are never completely explained, the birth of a Kitsune requires sacrifice, so a non-Kitsune parent of a Kitsune has a 90% chance of dying when the child is born. Yes, this happens to fathers as well as mothers.

A woman's chance of dying in each birth is about one in five, though a good midwife provides for a substantially better chance. Incidentally, a Hermetic maga who has any interest in the subject can more-or-less ensure a trouble-free birth, though doing this for a noble family may be illegal depending on local Hermetic politics.
</li><li> Is explicitly stated to be impossible for female Chosen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>. The infant may die, but not the mother. This is probably a specific design feature for the Dragon-Blooded, who must pass their power on genetically; the Celestial Exalts are just that tough. A certain amount of risk enters the equation if the Exalt gives birth too often (every five years is considered the minimum safe period), but the chances are still very slim.

<ul><li> Childbirth mortality rates have been somewhere between 'bad' and 'really' bad in most places, at most times. In some cases, the cures suggested by different civilisations' schools of medical thought were actually worse than doing nothing at all. For instance, it was (in some European circles) thought that the best way to assist a difficult birth was to get some people to hold the mother's torso upright and then <em>shake her up and down</em> to help the baby "fall out".
<ul><li> This trope is a largely a fitness trade-off of bipedalism; the birth canal does not have as much space. This is why unassisted birth is not nearly as much of an issue for other mammals as it is for humans. (Well, one reason, anyway. The other is that somewhere along the line, humans evolved a "hemochorial placenta"- that is, a placenta that <em>directly</em> intertwines the mother's blood vessels with those of the fetus. Most other mammals, with a few exceptions (such as mice, a few kinds of bats, and most apes and Old World monkeys) do not have a placenta this aggressive. This is also <a class="urllink" href="http://pleiotropy.fieldofscience.com/2014/05/how-woman-got-her-period.html">the reason for menstruation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and for many of the complications seen in late pregnancy and childbirth, such as preeclampsia.)
</li><li> The Catholic Church has a long tradition of preparing women to accept the very real (only nowadays not so much) possibility of dying in childbirth. The ritual of "churching" was performed for those women that recovered from the experience—a thanksgiving for her survival. There was some debate as to whether it should come before or after the child/children's funeral if they hadn't been so lucky.
</li></ul></li><li> Before the late 19th Century it was still more dangerous, statistically, for a woman to have children than it was for a man to fight in a war. The two things that changed this were industrialised warfare and the promulgation of the belief that having a clean person, clean possessions, and a clean environment was conducive to one's health — the so-called 'Sanitation' movement, which lobbied for such things as sewer systems. Until the latter got going the main cause of death in childbirth was still puerperal fever — that is, septicaemia caused by the bacteria on the midwife or obstetrician's hands. Not that birthing in hospitals — which had well-deserved reputations as death-traps—was common or anything, but it was commonplace for doctors to work with all sorts of patients — including the extremely sick and even the dead, as with dissections—without ever washing their hands. Pre-sanitation hospitals were, however, meticulously nice-smelling — to prevent the miasmal odours which were the root of all illness, dontchaknow, from infecting people.
<ul><li> Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweiss was the first to make the connection between clean hands and decreased risk of the puerperal fever, introducing a strict sanitation regime in his clinic with the use of soaps and antiseptics on pretty much everything. Unfortunately, he was basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">laughed out of the profession by other physicians</a>, because <em>of course</em> nothing bad could have come from that rotting corpse the doc was dissecting before going to deliver a baby—it hardly smelled rotten at all, not that you could tell with all the incense! It wasn't until Joseph Lister that medics started to take antiseptics seriously.
<ul><li> It gets worse. One of the main reasons Semmelweiss' groundbreaking research was ignored was that doctors at the time would have been primarily upper-middle-class, and according to the contemporary school of thought, 'a gentleman's hands were always clean'. Meaning that thousands of women continued to die horribly, even when medical science had proved proper sanitation would save <em>most</em> of them because a group of rich, educated men considered their lives less important than a perceived slight on their honour.
</li><li> Arguably, Florence Nightingale's contribution was even more important—not because she was a good nurse, but because she realised and was willing to admit she hadn't been. In her grief at the death her work caused, she convinced the world (via charts and figures) that it was better for a wounded Crimean soldier to be left in a ditch than to be taken to a hospital—and that to change this, doctors and especially nurses needed to wash between patients.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> According to popular folklore, the only Spartans with their names on their tombstones were those who died doing their greatest duty; men who died in battle and women who died in childbirth.
<ul><li> Similar with the Aztecs: Women who died in childbirth were considered heroines the same way as men who either died in battle or were sacrificed to the gods. The tombstone of one of them would become a shrine, and if the baby died as well, the dead mom's hands would be cut off and placed next to the baby's corpse as if they were holding him/her.
</li><li> And again similar with the Vikings — historians believe that death in childbirth for the Vikings was equivalent to death in battle and guaranteed entry into Valhalla.
</li><li> In ancient Greece, marriage for women (or, really, girls) was often portrayed as a form of death because chances were that she would die in childbirth before too long. This association is thought to lie at the heart of the myth of the abduction of Persephone by Hades.
</li><li> Islamic tradition also counts a woman who dies in childbirth (or during the 40-day postpartum phase) as a martyr.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Nonnatus">Saint Raymond Nonnatus's<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> myth says that the "Nonnatus" name was given to him since his mother died in childbirth and baby Raymond had to be pulled out through a C-section. Raymond is the patron saint of pregnant women, midwives, babies and anything related to childbirth: the biggest local church/parish of the Mercedarian Order in at least one place has an altar dedicated to him alone, covered in offers and written prayers from pregnant women who ask him for protection, as well as many photos of newborns and toddlers whose families prayed to Raymond to make sure they'd be born safely.
</li><li> For many species of plants and insects, death by childbirth is considered natural. Some animals and a vast majority of plants subscribe to the so-called "Semelparous"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0g2mn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0g2mn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0g2mn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the word derives from Semele, the mother of Dionysus, who was incinerated in the birthing process</span> strategy of reproduction, devoting all of its resources to one massive cycle of reproduction, which would so drain the mother that it would quickly die of starvation afterwards (this is opposed to the iteroparous strategy, where the mother would live to reproduce another day). The mother (and/or father) may be <em>designed</em> to die after reproduction, either to provide their own body as food for the young or so as not to take up the children's food.
<ul><li> The young of the sea louse <em>eat their mother alive from the inside out</em>.
</li><li> Octopodes. Contrary to popular belief, they do not die of starvation, but from accelerated aging triggered by their optic "suicide glands" after mating. See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex">Death by Sex</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> A similar version is an animal (for example, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarantula_hawk">the tarantula hawk<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) who lays their eggs into a victim. Once the eggs hatch, they eat their host from the inside out, usually always while the victim is alive.
</li><li> It's often thought that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar">Julius Caesar</a> was born by Caesarian section and therefore that his mother had died in childbirth (since Caesarians were 100% fatal to the mother at that date). Unfortunately for people who like to believe in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends">Urban Legends</a>, Aurelia Cotta survived her son's birth for many years.
</li><li> The "natural" level of maternal mortality in humans is 1 in 100 births. In sub-Saharan Africa, <em>1 in 16 women</em> are said to die in childbirth, compared to 1 in 2,800 in the developed world. Keep in mind, though, that these numbers may be wildly optimistic; in many African countries the poorest citizens, the ones most likely to die of such things as post-partum infections, live and die uncounted and unregistered.
</li><li> In 17th century England childbirth was (outside of the plague years) the most common cause of death in women. One historian estimated that <em>one in four</em> London women died of pregnancy or childbirth-related matters. This long before the "medicalization" of childbirth.
</li><li> Notable women who died in childbirth include: Julia Caesaris (Julius Caesar's daughter), Joan of England (Henry II of England's daughter), Margaret of Scotland (mother of Margaret, Maid of Norway), Isabella of Mar (Robert the Bruce's first wife), Marjorie Bruce (Robert the Bruce's daughter), Joanna of Bourbon, Mary de Bohun, Jadwiga of Poland, Elizabeth of York, Lucrezia Borgia, Jane Seymour, Isabella of Portugal, Katherine Parr, Elisabeth and Claude of France (daughters of Henry II of France), Gabrielle d'Estrées (mistress of Henri IV of France), Mumtaz Mahal (wife of Shah Jahan and the Taj Mahal was built in her honour), Margaret Theresa of Spain (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">Ill Girl</a> princess depicted in Velázquez's "Las Meninas"), mathematician Émilie du Châtelet, feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, Charlotte of Wales, cookbook writer Isabella Beeton, Alice Hathaway Lee Roosevelt (first wife of Teddy), writer and feminist Jean Webster, musician Nadine Shamir, and Mexican actress Marla Hiromi Hayakawa.
<ul><li> While she wasn't apparently blamed for it, Mary Wollstonecraft's daughter, also named Mary, arguably had issues... seeing as she grew up to become Mary Shelley and write <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a>, and according to a story, she wanted to, uh, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism">get to know</a> Percy Bysshe Shelley (her future husband) better when they met... over her mother's grave.
</li><li> Narrowly averted by Margaret Beaufort, the mother of Henry VII. And when we say narrowly... she was twelve years old, the youngest age at which a husband was allowed to have sex with his wife by English law of the time, and small and slight for her age; she had a horrifically difficult labour which no doubt caused permanent damage; and though she lived a fairly long life with a further two marriages, she never bore another child.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope was, unlikely as it may sound, a key factor in the ultimate conquest of Wales by the English. Llewelyn ap Gruffydd, the last native Prince of Wales, was allowed to wed Eleanor de Montfort, to whom he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage">betrothed</a>, in exchange for some concessions to her cousin, King Edward I. One of the concessions was that he cease resisting the English rule, and essentially act as Edward's governor in Wales. Llewelyn agreed out of love for Eleanor. Unfortunately, she died giving birth to their only child, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwenllian_of_Wales">Princess Gwenllian<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and poor Llewelyn kind of lost it. His younger brother Dafydd took advantage of his overwhelming grief to persuade Llewelyn to stage one last, dangerous campaign against the English, which they very much lost. Llewelyn was killed in the skirmish; Dafydd was captured and taken to London, where he had the dubious distinction of being the first person in recorded history to be hung, drawn and quartered; and the infant princess was kidnapped, taken to England, and raised in a convent to become a nun.
</li><li> It happened to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichalFriedman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichalFriedman">Michal Friedman</a>, NA voice actress and the wife of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanGreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanGreen">Dan Green</a>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.rememberthemothers.org">The Safe Motherhood Quilt Project<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was created to honor the memory of women who died from childbirth-related causes, as well as raise awareness, since maternal death tends to go unreported in the United States.
<ul><li> Maternal deaths tend to go unreported in most countries; the statistics given above are likely wildly <em>overoptimistic</em>.
</li><li> In the developed world, there are still very serious pregnancy complications that can prove fatal, especially for a mother who has not had access to prenatal care or is in poor overall health: <a class="urllink" href="http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Abstract/1988/07000/Maternal_Mortality_in_the_United_States__Report.20.aspx">ectopic pregnancies, eclampsia, embolism, anesthesia complications, sepsis caused by stillbirth or unsafe abortion, and hemorrhage<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, to name a few. Middle-class women with health insurance and no major pre-existing conditions are extremely unlikely to die suddenly in childbirth... those who are not so lucky are at higher risk.
</li></ul></li><li> According to the book <em>British Children's Fiction In The Second World War</em>, Katharine Tozer, the author of the Mumfie book series that is well known for inspiring the puppet show <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/PuppetShows/HereComesMumfie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/PuppetShows/HereComesMumfie">Here Comes Mumfie</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicAdventuresOfMumfie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicAdventuresOfMumfie">The Magic Adventures of Mumfie</a></em>, died this way.
</li><li> This trope is why many large-headed dog breeds, particularly bulldogs, are routinely delivered via veterinary Caesarian section. Generations of breeders' preferences for large heads and narrow hips have made it impossible to fit a newborn pup's head through the birth canal.
<ul><li> Also a common problem when a small-breed bitch is impregnated by a large-breed dog.
</li></ul></li><li> Some female mammals, such as guinea pigs or ferrets, <em>have</em> to be bred quite early in life if they're to become mothers at all. Otherwise, their pelvises fuse with a too-narrow outlet, making the birthing process extremely dangerous for them.
</li><li> Nadine Renee, singer of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">One-Hit Wonder</a> electro group Planet Soul, died from this in 2004.
</li><li> An enforced trope in all countries whose anti-abortion laws don't make exceptions even if the life of the woman is in danger.
</li><li> Sawfish babies' rostral spikes are covered with a dense gelatinous secretion prior to birth, to prevent their spines from cutting into the mother's uterine wall. If a pregnant female's labor is delayed due to sickness or obstruction, she can bleed out when her offsprings' spike-covered snouts lose their coverings while still <em>in utero</em>.
</li><li> There is a condition called <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetric_fistula">obstetric fistula<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which results from prolonged labor in situations where a Caesarean section is unavailable. The baby's head presses on blood vessels, constricting them, resulting in the necrosis of surrounding tissue. (The result is the uncontrollable leakage of urine and/or feces through the vagina.) It almost always results in death for the baby, and it <em>can</em> result in death to the mother, either right then and there, or sometimes many months or years down the line, as a result of infections or even paralysis, as well as the marginalization that tends to happen as a result of the smell. It is most prevalent in developing countries, where prenatal and emergency obstetric care is limited, and where women tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">married off</a> (and become pregnant) at an early age (before their pelvises and cervixes are fully developed) and/or have many closely-spaced pregnancies. It <em>can</em> happen in developed countries as well, though it's much rarer.
</li><li> The genitalia of the female spotted hyena is unique. Their clitoris is 7 inches long and appears as a pseudopenis, and they give birth through a one-inch slit that incidentally has a bend in it and they also urinate through it. The mother has a wide plethora of complications that can kill her, including cubs getting stuck or resulting in her bleeding to death from tearing, especially in first litters - if the journey out doesn't suffocate the cub on top of everything else. And you thought humans were ill-suited for childbirth.
</li><li> This combined with historically high infant mortality rates may be one of the main reasons why Kings were favored to rule throughout most history over Queens. The point of creating a dynasty in the first place is to have a successor so that one's court and key supporters don't go ahead and nominate their own successor (and possibly try to go ahead and put him on the throne at the first sign of the incumbent king's failing health). If the king dies without a successor, and his key supporters have no plan in place to replace him, one can expect a bloody power struggle to ensue that could tear the country apart and leave it vulnerable to foreign invasion. It simply would not do if your female monarch were to die during childbirth, likely taking her newborn heir with her and leaving the kingdom with no leadership at all. With a man on the throne, however, he just has to keep impregnating queens until one survives long enough to give him a healthy heir.
</li><li> This is an ever-increasing concern in the developed world, as more and more bacteria become resistant to more and more antibiotics, such as ones that are given shortly before, during, or after childbirth to prevent infections. This may also make <em>any</em> surgery, including C-sections (which <em>do</em> save the lives of women who might otherwise die in childbirth) increasingly risky, or even impossible. We very well could see a return to Victorian-era rates of maternal and infant mortality <em>in our lifetimes</em> if the issue of antibiotic resistance is not addressed <em>soon</em>.
</li><li> While horses normally give birth to a foal just fine, birthing <em>twins</em> is a medical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedAlert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedAlert">Red Alert</a> — the pregnancy (and therefore delivery) is doubly hard on the mother, both foals will be undersized and are frequently born prematurely as well, and the hardship of a twin-birth is almost guaranteed to kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">at LEAST one of the three horses.</a> Modern vets use ultrasound to detect embryos as soon as possible and abort one embryo to save the other, but in the event that a twin-birth sneaks through early detection, it's one of the only times that people agree to induce premature labor—which is usually a bad idea for horses, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">not AS bad</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">trying to carry twin foals to term,</a> or having the mare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientMiscarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientMiscarriage">miscarry anyway.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneAusten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneAusten">Jane Austen</a> lost two of her sisters in law to childbirth within a few years of each other. Some have theorized that some of her books have the fear of this in subtext.
