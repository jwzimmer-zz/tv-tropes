</p><p>This is because in the vast majority of games, time only passes meaningfully in the gameworld <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EventDrivenClock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EventDrivenClock">as the player advances through the story</a>. However, in order to progress the story or quest at hand, the player has to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EventFlag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EventFlag">trigger an event</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowThePlottedLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowThePlottedLine">going somewhere or doing something specific</a>, and until they do, time will effectively stand still.
</p><p>On a smaller scale, even the most pressing, immediate tasks, such as, say, rescuing a fellow character who is dangling off a ledge at five hundred feet in the air, can be done at one's leisure, provided there isn't a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">number countdown ticking away on screen</a>. Of course, the accompanying cutscene might still depict you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysClose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysClose">arriving just barely in time</a> (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreTooLate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreTooLate">only moments too late</a>), and you can expect NPCs to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinueYourMissionDammit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinueYourMissionDammit">nag you constantly to establish a false sense of urgency</a>.

In-game time passes consistently and is very important, as certain events will only take place at certain times (i.e. the Curiosity Shop only being open at night) and the moon will crash into the world if you take too long.. The game manages to get away with this by allowing you to go back in time to complete events you missed. Likewise, once the Four Giant hold the moon in place and you go inside it, you can take as long as you want since the giants' strength never gives out.

That being said, you are <em>also</em> told that Ganon's seal should hold for a while, and everyone recommends you spend as much time as possible preparing instead of charging off half-cocked and getting immediately killed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ganon will eventually break free of Zelda's seal on him, but only at the exact moment you cross the threshold of the Sanctum where he is trapped.</span>

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami">Ōkami</a></em>, a later sequence in the game tells you about the coming Day of Darkness, when the sun will be swallowed and there's nothing you can do about it. Since you're the Goddess of the Sun, this would be a Very Bad Thing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but of course, no matter how much you dawdle, the sun is only swallowed the <em>moment the final boss stares you down</em>, leaving you powerless</span>.
<ul><li> However, in an earlier chapter, if you dawdle too long, Oni Island WILL disappear.

However, the last four Colossi all require lengthy voyages through the land to reach and protracted battles to defeat. Dormin announces before you fight the last one that you need to get a shift on, but you can still go sightseeing or food hunting, and the inevitable won't take place until just after you've killed the last Colossus.

In reality, you can take as long as you need to find a way to save them <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">though this is because the Joker was bluffing about the bomb</span>.
<ul><li> This occurs in every game. Once you have control of Batman, you can explore as much as possible, obtaining Riddler secrets and upgrades, before you have to move to the next plot point.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising">Dead Rising</a></em> is famous for averting this as hard as possible, since every single Case and Scoop is timed. The only exception to this rule is the very first Case, which actually runs for the entire length of the game if the player lets it, meaning that Brad and Carlito can potentially have a 72 hour long gunfight.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarI">God of War</a></em>, an oracle is dangling from a rope at one point.

However, you can take as long as you want in solving the puzzle that allows you to reach that platform, despite her cries.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> games, if you take too long to rescue a person about to fall they will drop. However, once you've grabbed them it's treated as completely reasonable to walk all around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity">New York City</a> with them. This can lead to some pretty funny results if you're investigating a random crime, in which case you're not ever punished for failing, taking too long, or going outside the event area. As a result, you carry around things like muggers, balloons, or even a <em>purse</em>, which doesn't impede your abilities at all, and you can carry it back to its owner for a free health refill. You can even take time out from fighting a pair of battlesuits to rescue a little girl's balloon, and the health refill you get from this <em>will actually enhance your fight with the suits</em>.
</li><li> Also happens with the plot in <em>Spider-Man 2</em>. Unless a timer specifically shows up, you can spend <em>ages</em> swinging around solving random crimes and you will always be just <em>sliiiiightly</em> late, when rationally you should be showing up three days after class ended.

As you follow him to another world and run after him, he is always just far enough ahead of you so you can see him dash out of sight. But it doesn't matter how long you wait before you take the next step following him. In fact, you can just sit down and read the diary Atrus gave you, for example, and then continue the chase. He will still only be a few steps ahead of you.

But no matter how long you explore, it'll always be a peaceful sunny day with nary an earthquake in sight (at least until you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">strike the death blow to end the world</span>). There is one timed interaction in the game, but you get a long window and three chances (with clear warnings) to make the "right" choice.

You can light the dynamite while in another building, go outside, over to the other building where you have to throw it, throw the dynamite, then just as lazily walk to a safe distance. The dynamite won't blow until you're out of reach anyway.
</li><li> Mostly played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGlory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGlory">Quest for Glory</a> I</em>, <em>III</em>, <em>IV</em>, and <em>V</em>, though specific sequences are timed (for example if you dawdle too long during the final confrontation with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, he'll take you down). <em>II</em> averts the trope altogether, with hazards, sidequests, and other opportunities only being available on specific in-game dates, and are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">permanently missable</a>, possibly resuling in Unwinnable situations or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">Non Standard Game Over</a>.
<ul><li> Though the time limits in the second game are very obvious. Whenever an elemental appears, you have 3 days to deal with it, and it destroys the city on the fourth day. The comments you get from NPCs are increasingly anxious as the days go on, with their comments on the last day pointing out that the elemental is about to destroy everything. Sidequests are less forgiving, but they are specifically pointed to as soon as they are available. For example, you might get a message from the innkeeper as soon as you wake up that the guard at the city entrance wants to speak to you, which is avoidable only if you stay out all night...in which case you've almost certainly been out in the desert all night and will automatically see the guard at the city entrance next time you return to the city.

Despite the urgency, this mission has no time limit and there is nothing stopping you from teleporting back to your home base to talk with people, answer some quiz or play training missions. It becomes even more ridiculous when later in the game after Dr. Doom steals Odin's power and his misuse is starting to unravel reality that the team is sent on a quest to gain special items in order to stand a chance against him, there is no need to rush even though all of existence is at stake. You can go back to your base right in the middle of a important mission where you need to steal an important item from Galactus while he is threatening to devour the whole Skrull homeworld and you can stall for as long as you want, even go back to previous locations in the game.

When the boss Luard appears, there is no rush to take him on (which is a good thing, because he's quite hard and you may need to level up a bit).

While there's no timer on the quest, every time you enter the Processing Room, that conveyor belt will constantly be feeding humans into a machine and pooping out what's implied to be their souls. There is nothing you can do about it other than watch and listen to their screams, as the conveyor belt will stop you from getting on (and body-blocking the humans).

Griffon's army is closing in on the Gundorada Workshop in the future? No problem!

Now, the map world has day and night, and you can run around all you like, or take a few nights at the inn, or the like, before continuing. And you almost certainly must do so (since by the time you get to this point, it's too early to attempt the cave where the bracelet is). But when you finally get around to moseying into the graveyard at night, there they are, waiting for you...

Also, Rhapthorne the dog heads into Savella Cathedral after you follow him.

If you just sit there and watch it go forward, it will eventually just stop right in front of Midgar and politely wait for you to kick its ass.
</li><li> When Tifa is captured by Shinra and is tied down to a chair in a gas chamber, you have to manipulate her head, legs, and arms to pick up the key in front of her feet.

In all, she ends up holding on for a solid thirty minutes, while the two Gardens keep <em>crashing into each other</em>.
<ul><li> There's also a point in the story where you're sent on a mission to assassinate Edea.

To its credit, the game does some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> on this by having the character state, "You wanna to play cards now!?"

She leaves the room and you have to go after her... but, not only you can take as long as you want talking to everybody, you can actually talk to the Moogle in the room to spend the night in a Tent. And when you leave the room, you'll still catch up with her right in front of the building. It's like a video game version of The Tortoise and the Hare.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV">Final Fantasy XV</a></em> has issues with this due to the open-world nature of the game encouraging side quest completion, yet this sometimes conflicts with the story having more urgent chapters than others. In Chapter 1 for example, you can take however long you want to explore the Leide region, sleep multiple nights at camp, participate in hunts, etc. but Insomnia will only fall once you're ready to set sail for Altissia. However, in chapter 9, you get the ability to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> return to the past</span>, allowing you to take as long as you like.

This is particularly zany when having to confront the Big Bad's team and just leave them hanging to level up.
</li><li> In <em>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</em> for the Super Famicom, Jotaro's group has 50 days to save his mother from Dio's curse. This means you can only sleep at the Speedwagon Foundation 25 times and if you do, then the option simply becomes unavailable.

But there's a lot more interesting things you can do in the North Mountain and if not, you can exit the world, so why would you bother?
</li><li> Upon reaching Keyblade Graveyard's labyrinth, you can see the other Guardians of Light duking it out with the True Organization XIII members in the distance, but their battles won't be triggered unless you come near them. While you cannot exit to the world map, you can take your sweet time buying things from Mog, saving, or entering the Battlegates for as long as you want.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork">Mega Man Battle Network</a></em> series does this a lot. Often, there will be something bad going on, like your house's kitchen being set on fire, the ventilation system for the basement you are trapped in having been shut down, the plane you are in being about to crash, or a powerful Navi is wreaking havoc on the Net. However, you can fool around all you want and when you DO start your mission, you'll arrive just in time to put an end to the problem.
<ul><li> In <em>Mega Man Battle Network 3</em>, Wily's evil plan can go off at any time, yet you can go back and forth between ACDC Town and Wily's fortress as many times as you want, a process that takes half an hour according to the game, and Wily still hasn't set off his plans yet.
</li><li> Even better, in <em>Mega Man Battle Network 2</em> and <em>4</em>, you can take an airplane to <em>different parts of the world</em> every time there's something urgent.
</li><li> This gets a little silly with some of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> elements, as some of the secret areas can only be entered after you've completed the game. Naturally for the new game you'd instantly boot up the last save point you had, as that's when you have logically the strongest equipment (and because Megaman would inform you that proceeding further would not allow you to save anymore). This point is usually right before the final boss fight, which almost always has the fate of the world hanging in the balance. The entire world is basically frozen in that one moment of doom while you go off into some weird part of the net to fight a completely unrelated boss for shits and giggles (and some otherwise unattainable chips). However, this can result in the "panic" music for that game being permanently on in the real world for the duration of your escapades (which can get a bit annoying).
</li><li> Continued in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManStarForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManStarForce">Mega Man Star Force</a></em>, in which you can not only fit in hours of adventuring during any given day, but you can do this on days when ancient and/or alien superweapons are pointed directly at your house and ticking, without actually risking any harm to your home or friends.

He's a bully and a would-be tyrant who is trying to invade Evermore and take it over and more than once challenges King Evan to battles via the game's skirmish mechanic. However, so long as you just ignore the optional sidequests, he's apparently happy to be left waiting. What's more, even if you do engage in it, you can lose with no real penalty. Even the skirmish itself has elements of this, as you have to beat him back several times and at one point he even claims to have nipped inside your kingdom's borders for lunch. And at the end of each one, he promises to come back and try again later.

You can go all the way through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a>, get right up to the save point outside the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>'s lair... and then turn right back around, leave the dungeon, level grind, and complete all the sidequests in the game.

Everything in their personal lives will wait until the player is ready: Kaz can go the better part of a year not getting medical attention for a severe knee injury and still be fine, the Drama/Music clubs in <em>4</em> can go months between practice sessions, and the most extreme example: one of the Links in <em>3</em> is <em>dying</em>, yet he always manages to last long enough to max his Link, regardless of how long it takes.
</li><li> The Dark Hour in <em>Persona 3</em> is explicitly stated to be an "extra" hour that most people cannot experience, and it's where the entirety of the game's dungeon crawling takes place. There's no actual timer of any sort, of course, so the player is free to continue grinding in Tartarus well past what would only be a single hour.

The Kimono Girls also wait for you in the remakes to perform their ritual.
<ul><li> Technically, there is a reason you can take forever and never worry about Giovanni turning up, at least in the remakes. It's because after obtaining a Celebi, you travel back in time, beat Giovanni, and get told by him that even though he's been training since another kid beat him three years ago, the fact that you beat him means he still isn't ready to come back and take charge of Team Rocket again. Admittedly this just means you have to take your time getting a Celebi, but since it's time travel, you have all the time in the world.

In Platinum, at least, Lake Acuity can only be accessed by noncombat use of Rock Climb, which <em>forces you to detour</em> to Snowpoint City and defeat the Gym so that you can use Rock Climb outside of battle.

And even then, he doesn't fully fire it until you get through the <em>other</em> secret base, capture the mascot legendary, and fight him again — you could go off and money grind at the Battle Chateau, breed some 'mons, or do whatever else you want while the Ultimate Weapon is just sitting there in Geosenge Town.

Yet, most players would leave the dungeon to do sidequests. In fact, many sidequests aren't available <em>at all</em> until you've entered and left the final dungeon.

After the team regroups, you can take care of all the things you forgot, including Gladsheim (a bonus level that can take an upwards of 3 hours to complete). When you finally do get to the final boss, he's JUST about to complete his goal.
<ul><li> In the Temples of Fire and Lightning, certain delays, if taken too much, can in fact lead to the heroes being too late to grab two of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">Mac Guffins</a>, which will then be lost to them for an extended period of time. But <em>only</em> if time is lost in those specific ways. Other than that, you can take all the time you want.
</li></ul></li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia">Tales of Vesperia</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Duke has raised Tarqaron for the sole purpose of</span> absorbing the life of everyone on the planet <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in order to defeat the Adephagos</span>. In fact, many people in the world are already feeling its effects, meaning he's already absorbing their life! Of course, you can take as long as you want to go there, and the game actively <em>encourages</em> you to do just that, as a huge chunk of the available sidequests only become available after this happens.
<ul><li> When traveling to Nordopolica the first time, Kaufman tells you she's in a hurry to beat Leviathan's Claw (who've been taking her customers); however, you can make a brief detour since you're making good time. At this point, quite a few sidequests (some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">time-sensitive</a>) open up in almost every city you've visited thus far (and some require staying the night at an inn). You still make it in time anyway (Leviathan's Claw must be pretty slow).
</li><li> Immediately afterwards you're told the only time you can meet the head of Nordopolica is on the night of the new moon. You leave and go take care of other business for the next 15 or so days. The game requires you to spend at least 6 nights in inns while taking care of the business and 3 more for sidequests. So far that's 9 of the 15 days. Then there's the desert level you pass through with a day/night cycle. Regardless of how long you take you'll still get there in time.

Even after they've trekked all the way through the final dungeon and had a pep talk about how they're going to finish this once and for all, none of the party finds it strange to then wander off to get some new clothes.
<ul><li> What makes this more amusing is that the writing feels like it was trying particularly hard to create a sense of urgency in the player. But since a lot of the sidequests have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">odd cut-offs for no apparent reason</a> and a lot of them are the only way to learn about the world, its history, and most of the backstory of one of the characters, by all means run around bothering random NPCs while the land threatens to collapse, it'll wait for you.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfGraces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfGraces">Tales of Graces</a></em>, there are moments of urgency in the game where you obviously have to go somewhere...however you cannot doof around doing whatever, as the game may tell you "No that's not the right way" because the characters will know they can't just run around. However, you can take all you want in some dungeons when you attempt to stop something. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Valkines Cryas in Fendel is about to explode?

Sometimes you can't wander around (the game will railroad you into a certain time-relevant story mission), but at other points, such as the end of the game where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Elraine is supposedly about to awaken the goddess Fortuna</span>, you can go around finding hidden items, find hidden villages, and open up the path to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a> (as well as going through the bonus dungeon) with no ill effects. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Elraine</span> will patiently wait for you even though she's actively been trying to prevent you from reaching her (or at least trying to delay you) at every opportunity before now.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms1">Wild ARMs 1</a></em> there is no hurry to get to the final boss. In fact, you can only get the secret character and do most of the sidequests by going half into then back out of the final dungeon with a specific item.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionRPG">Action RPG</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou">The World Ends with You</a></em> (or <em>It's a Wonderful World</em>), the plot involves placing missions with time limits on players; if the mission is not cleared within the time limit, then any players in the mission will be erased. However, you can deviate from the mission as long as you want. Even if the game recognizes that a full week has passed, you can take your time leveling up as much as you want, and spend time shopping as long as you want; the time limit is only plot sensitive. Funny enough, each Reaper Game is seven days as well, and the game explicitly gives you XP for your pins for up to a week of not playing your DS after saving.
</li><li> Towards the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga">Xenosaga</a> Episode 1</em>, an orbital superweapon is being aimed at a planet, and you are told it will be ready to fire in 5-10 minutes. Even if you <em>do</em> rush through the next portion of the game, it will take at least 45 minutes to an hour or so to stop the weapon, without it ever firing. Of course, you can also go the usual route and spend hours or days leveling and working on sidequests/minigames, too.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChroniclesX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChroniclesX">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a></em>:
<ul><li> The main plot of the game revolves around trying to find the Lifehold Core's location before its power source runs down. However, the power level only decreases as the story progresses, meaning you can spend the time between chapters doing whatever you want.
</li><li> In general, none of the quests have time limits for their objectives, which is reasonable for objectives like "collect five flowers", and somewhat less reasonable when the objective is "protect this person from being devoured by a ravenous beast". It's almost inevitable that you'll get distracted by something and leave an NPC stranded out in the middle of a desert or jungle for the in-game equivalent of several weeks, only to return later and find them still waiting for you, none the worse for wear. The most egregious example occurs during a Chapter 6 story mission: you can strand Tatsu in the middle of Dead Man's Gulch (an area full of creatures that attack any living organism) for an indefinite period of time and he'll be fine, even though he has no combat ability.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a></em> has similar issues in that almost no quests or story events have time limits, meaning you can feel free to spend a few days playing Tora's <em>Tiger! Tiger!</em> video game if you want. That kid stranded in the tree by a bunch of monsters can just sit tight. It's especially egregious when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you're trapped inside a sinking Titan and everything inside is going to die in exactly three hours unless you stop it, but no matter how many hours pass while inside that Titan, doom never comes.</span>

<ul><li> This happens near the end of the game. At one point your heart will start to stop beating, which slowly reduces your maximum health until it is dealt with (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">explanation</a> for why this takes time is that "The heart's a stubborn muscle").

<ul><li> At the end of the game, the player character and his ally are running around Rapture, trying to escape before several timed charges go off and sink the city. The ally repeatedly shouts things like "We must hurry!", but you don't have to.
</li><li> There's also the Siren Alley level, when Sinclair is stuck in what's left of your train car in the flooded Dionysus Park station and urges you to hurry up because he's running out of air. You're quite a long way from completing the level when he says this, even if you do hurry.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite">BioShock Infinite</a></em>, when you first meet Elizabeth and Songbird arrives at her tower, you can wait as long you'd like in the library.

Any NPC dialogue or conversations that progress as you make your way through a quest will pick up right where they left off without missing a beat even if you leave a mission to go spend hours doing sidequests before returning. However, it is subverted at the end of one mission when you are told to rescue an ally before a constructor robot takes him away; even though there is no on-screen timer or other indication of time passing, if you don't destroy the robot within five minutes, it flies away with him, and you have to complete a whole additional sub-mission to break him out of a prison camp before you can proceed with the main story.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare2">Modern Warfare 2</a></em>, there are no more rooms of infinite-respawning enemies, so in a lot of places it is to your advantage to take it slow even though your commander is yelling in your ear to "Hurry! Hurry! We're Oscar Mike!" The only notable exception occurs in "Whiskey Hotel". If you take too long to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">get to the roof of the White House</span>, the bombers WILL destroy it.

</li><li> Most challenges in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em> series allow you to take as long as you need, provided you can keep certain key allies alive. However, the jump to Xen includes a time-critical moment between when the gate opens and when it malfunctions; miss it and get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">Non Standard Game Over</a>.
<ul><li> At the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em>, there are several instances where the dialogue makes you believe you need to leave quickly to avoid the Combine. One is the first meeting with Barney, another is in the apartments. You can stay as long as you want watching the citizen hold that door against the Combine. It'll never open. However, the last battle gives you a limited amount of time to defeat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> before he wins by default.
</li><li> Perhaps the most obvious examples of this trope are when Combine soldiers were coming and you have to set up a perimeter with turrets. You can take as much time as you want doing this, and in fact <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the first time around you can even pile up junk in front of entrances to keep the Combine out completely</span>, but the Combine only start coming once the last turret has been placed.
</li><li> <em>Episode 1</em> does this for the entire game. The citadel's core is on the verge of causing an explosion that will completely wipe out City 17. In the start of the game, Alyx keeps reminding you about the crisis, but you can go as slow as you want and the core will still be intact. Plot wise, Gordon and Alyx can take a bit more time on escaping after they delayed the core from going off, but when their plan stops working, Alyx once again urges Gordon to keep moving, but you can still go at a leisurely pace. The Citadel never explodes until after Gordon and Alyx board the train and leave City 17.
<ul><li> Similarly, Episode Two does this on several occasions. You are reminded several times that the Combine are hunting down Alyx and Gordon because they stole data from the Citadel that can be used against them. Even though you are urged to hurry to White Forest, you can practically hold down the walk button and the rebels' reaction to your arrival would still be the same. Likewise, after Alyx gets impaled by a Hunter, you are urged to be swift and retrieve an antlion larva extract to prevent Alyx from dying. No matter how fast or slow you go, by the time you come back with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>, you'll always hear how Alyx's pulse has stopped and you're always in the nick of time to save her.

The zombies, however, are not so polite, and will happily take the extra chances to continue trying to kill you.
<ul><li> Technically, all the rescue vehicles that come to rescue you like to take their time in both games. They say they will be there in ten minutes, but really only appear after you kill the second (or in "Swamp Fever", third) Tank.

<ul><li> Played straight for the most part in that the Galactic Federation is certainly nice to wait on Samus when it comes to her doing the critically essential tasks they assign her in one or two places.

</li><li> Subverted in the opening mission, where you have to get to a planetary defense cannon and activate it to keep a Phazon-laced meteor from infecting the planet. There's no audible or visible countdown, leading the player to believe there isn't a concrete time limit — but if you wait long enough, the meteor grows in the sky and <em>will</em> slam into the planet.
</li></ul></li><li> Not only does <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedFaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedFaction">Red Faction</a></em> use this trope, it actually has an NPC pull a weird inversion on <em>you</em>. When Capek's base is on a one-minute self-destruct timer, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eos</span> insists that you escape while she finds some crucial data. She won't move a muscle until you're gone — but even if you leave her only one second on the timer, she'll somehow turn up later having accomplished her mission. Apparently <em>other</em> characters can Take Their Time as long as you're not around!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsRepublicCommando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsRepublicCommando">Star Wars: Republic Commando</a></em> plays this straight in some missions, where you're told to rush but there is no timer and events won't happen until you trigger them. Other missions, however, have 'time limits' in the form of more enemies being in the area depending on how long you take to get there. There's also a genuine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">Timed Mission</a> at the end of the first chapter, where you're trying to get off a ship that you've sabotaged which will self-destruct in five minutes.

<ul><li> The personal story quests in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em> often have a sense of urgency about them, and at least one instance in each story arc where you have to pick one mission, often making you choose between saving a named NPC or averting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMillionIsAStatistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMillionIsAStatistic">A Million Is a Statistic</a>. Because there often isn't enough time to do both. Except that the next story mission generally has a level requirement about 3 levels higher than the previous, so the game clearly expects you to Take Your Time and do some general questing.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em>, unless your contact specifically says that you X amount of time before the bomb goes off/they escape with the hostages/initiate their plan you can take all the time you need. But <em>if</em> there is a set time, you have exactly that much time; even if you exit the game and get back in, the timer is still ticking.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em>, many quests have rather urgent situations that you can just leave alone and solve it later. Recipe For Disaster justifies this by putting the events of the quest in a time-bubble.
<ul><li> Parodied in "One Small Favor". After the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfDeals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfDeals">Chain of Deals</a> takes you across a good four or five countries and back on foot, doing various tasks the whole way, the person who gave you the initial quest is furious that you took so long, doesn't care about all the other people you helped along the way, and declares that you don't deserve any reward at all since he could have gotten his mahogany polish just fine without you in the first place and it wouldn't have taken nearly so long. He relents after you snap at him and tell him just what you've had to deal with.
</li></ul></li><li> The island quest in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em> is an impressive example. Ostensibly a war between two opposing hordes of mobs, it actually involves both armies waiting passively for you to systematically eradicate them. If you do some sidequests, killing a mob will trigger a fixed number of extra kills by the side you're fighting for, but they still won't score any kills when you're not around, no matter how long you screw around in other areas.
</li><li> Played completely straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> nine times out of ten. One quest in particular that springs to mind involves a competition with a dwarf as to who can kill 60 animals first. This quest is specifically designed to overlap with other "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassMonsterSlaughterSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassMonsterSlaughterSidequest">Kill X many Y</a>" quests which have a far smaller amount of animals to kill - at certain points when you have killed a specific number of animals, the dwarf will appear, laugh at you about how many more animals he has killed, and disappear. Around the 40 point he'll take a nap, at 55 or so he'll wake up, and at 60 he'll be 2 or so kills behind you.
<ul><li> An example pointed out a few times on fansites involves Sentinel Hill, a military base and the only place in the entire Westfall region that isn't full of homeless people, burning to the ground by the Defias Brotherhood. The leader, Gryan Stoutmantle, yells at you to hurry to Stormwind and tell King Varian, telling you to take a gryphon and not waste any time. You can go anywhere on that gryphon, maybe spend a few hours in a dungeon, heck, level all the way up to the level cap if you'd like.

Apparently, it will take 30 years, but one year here is sixty years, meaning they could literally destroy the Earth <em>twice</em> while the party is training, goofing off, and even fishing.

Both games not only let you return to other planets, but encourage it by introducing side-quests which require you to go elsewhere. In both, once you've reached the final boss, you can leave the region — and the planet, if you wish — and return later, with no risk of him actually using the weapon.
<ul><li> Towards the end of the third game, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the <em>Phoenix</em> is invaded in a last-ditch attempt by the villain to eliminate the Q-Force</span>. The few survivors are huddled under a walkway on the bridge, only metres from enemy forces. In the plot, this is made out to be a matter of urgency and the ship explicitly goes above normal speed to get there; you're not even given a choice of locations.

You then have to navigate the debris, make you way to the villain, beat <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her</span> up and rescue your friends all before hitting the ground.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2">Sonic Adventure 2</a></em> has a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">Timed Missions</a> where the plot mandates more urgency (notably when the military base is about to explode).

However, it's played straight with the ending stages of both Hero and Dark stories - whether you're rushing to stop Eggman from firing the ARK on the Earth, or rushing to stop the heroes from stopping Eggman from firing the ARK on the Earth, this trope is in full effect. This is also played straight in Cannon's Core, where you supposedly have only 27 minutes 53 seconds to complete it and the following boss battles but exceeding the time has no penalty.

<ul><li> Snake does gets complimented on his fitness or teased about his age depending on how long the player takes to get out of the underground dock.
</li><li> <em>Portable Ops</em> has this trope as well, in an interesting form. The game has a date system, it keeps track of the day, month, year and time of day because part of the gameplay aspect involves passing time to create items or using night as a sneaking tactic. But, because of the series' established continuity, and the fact that Portable Ops is a prequel, in theory Big Boss can only spend so long on this mission before the continuity calls for him to be elsewhere doing other stuff. This doesn't happen, if you take too long, the date system will merely say: "Time Paradox".

You can choose to go with Rick to help rescue Tom, where upon finding him, you see that he has been heavily wounded. Despite Rick's insistence that they must hurry and get Tom to a safe place, you can take as long as you want to progress and Tom will never bleed out. Likewise, you also find a scientist locked in a gas chamber and is poisoned from the gas. To save him, you have to mix the gasses in the proper color combinations to neutralize the gas.

While the dramatic music plays and the radio occasionally squawks, "Billy, help!" Billy (controlled by the player) can take nearly as much time as he needs to collect ammo and health, kill zombies and apes, and get to where she dangles over certain doom; there actually is a time limit, but it's fairly generous.

In fact, you then have to head through the actual rocket storage bay to search an office — at which point a guard spots you and you have to fight your way out. About halfway through the battle, things start burning and you're told to get out, but you still have to mow through more guards, who are in no more of a hurry to escape than you are.

You're told via radio that you'd better get a move on if you want to get in on the profits, but there's nothing stopping you from turning around, walking all the way back to the starting village, hocking a bunch of gear, taking a few side missions, fending off a bandit attack, hunting some artifacts for petty cash, maybe grabbing lunch, and then heading back just in time to join up with a bunch of other stalkers who were heading towards Pripyat.
</li><li> In <em>Call of Pripyat</em>, you're sent in to find out what happened to an entire heliborne platoon of soldiers that were heading towards the center of the Zone. They're in an <em>extremely</em> hostile area, filled with people who shoot anyone wearing a military uniform on sight, short on supplies and ammo and are waiting on you and you alone to find them and get them home.

<ul><li> There's also the point in the second game, when the protagonist's kid brother falls into a river and gets swept away, and is at risk of drowning or getting eaten by monsters. You can still go back to the village, do some grinding, push a few bills in the Assembly... lampshaded if you talk to your mom, and she points out that you should be saving your brother instead.
</li><li> Interestingly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaPucelle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaPucelle">La Pucelle</a></em> makes this into a plot point: Noir, having captured Dark Prince Croix, intends on sacrificing him to summon the Fallen Angel Calamity, and then take her power for his own.

On the other, the whole campaign is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">Timed Mission</a> with limited options for stalling. Balancing your own progress with that of the Avatar Project is part of the strategy.

</li><li> In the first mission of the prequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a></em>, you are sent to handle a hostage situation, but if you dick around the Sarif Offices too long, the hostages will be executed, and you'll arrive only to have to fight Purists. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary">Developer Commentary</a> reveals it was originally not going to be timed, before someone realized "Oh my god, it's all smoke and mirrors!" and the dev team raced to squeeze in what they needed for the hostage execution scenario right at the end of development.
</li></ul></li><li> No matter how quickly or slowly you progress through the quests in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII">Diablo II</a></em>, you're always just a step behind the Dark Wanderer. No matter how long it takes to get through the expansion chapter, you can never beat Baal to the Worldstone, but he doesn't have time to finish corrupting it and leave.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>. The Blight never gets past Lothering until the plot advances far enough. Indeed, every location in the game seems to be frozen in one point in time, until the player does something to advance the plot.
<ul><li> You can wander around the Mage Tower all you like and you never have to worry about the demons taking it over or the Templars storming it and killing all the mages, assuming you failed. The same happens in The Fade.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOriginsAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOriginsAwakening">Dragon Age: Origins  Awakening</a></em>, the attack on Amaranthine and Vigil's Keep do not go off until you arrive to stop it.
</li><li> Early on, when you have to light the beacon, you can look around the tower for as much loot as possible and take your time doing it even though every character up to that point has been saying how quickly this task must be done.
</li><li> Arguably most gratuitous in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a> quest at the end of the Redcliffe arc. You can elect to go to the mages tower instead of making a decision of whether to kill a possessed child, who is possessed by a demon capable of making the dead rise, or to sacrifice his mother to get the demon out. There are no consequences for this decision, you can faff around as much as you like on the trip to the mages tower and back without consequences, despite there being the very real danger of the abomination going berserk and killing everyone in the castle. And if you haven't already completed the Mage Tower main quest at this point, you have enough time to do that (including the lengthy Fade sequence) and get back to Redcliffe with no consequences.
</li><li> What's worse is that if you do the mage origin, Wynne will ask you how long you've been away from the Tower, and your answer? <em>One Year</em>. Which means that it takes roughly <em>one year</em> just to go to Ostagar, witness a battle, pass through Lothering, spend one day at Redcliffe, and fight your way to the top of a tower (assuming you proceed in the intended order). Given that this is about a quarter of the game, it's theoretically possible to leave elves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">in pain and shapeshifting into werewolves</a>, let the dwarves continue fighting over succession and watch Arl Eamon die slowly of poison with a demon-possessed child in his room, for <em>up to four years</em>.
<ul><li> And if you play the <em>Return to Ostagar</em> DLC, you can find King Cailan's body after all this time, and somehow it's still intact and not at all decomposed.
</li></ul></li><li> The only exception is the saving of Redcliffe village — Take Your Time around the village, but if you leave to go anywhere else, it's completely destroyed when you come back. But even this doom only triggers when you actually arrive at Redcliffe. If you avoid going there at all, the undead hordes will stay back so the attack will always happen the night after you first arrive regardless of when you do so.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakensang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakensang">Drakensang</a></em> you can always take your time to solve quests, even those in the main line. This is especially jarring in the first and third Oracle quests (in the former, you've to rescue a mage who's keeping a barrier against a horde of zombies in a swamp, the latter deals with an army of Orcs and Ogres sieging a castle).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>: In general throughout the series, this is played straight with very few exceptions in line with the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">Wide Open Sandbox</a> nature. Even as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> stands ready to bring about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a>, there is no harm in taking 20 hours to finish that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideQuestSideStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideQuestSideStory">faction questline</a> or collect those <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses">20 Bear Asses</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IrrelevantSideQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IrrelevantSideQuest">that trader in that remote village</a>. The only exceptions are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">quests which give you as specific time limit</a>, and these are very few and far between. To note some specific examples by game:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall">Daggerfall</a></em> is the only game in the series which lacks an oncoming disaster as part of the main quest, yet, amusingly and ironically, is the game in the series with the <em>most</em> main quest missions that have time limits. In fact, the very first mission of the main quest requires you to meet with Lady Brisienna, an agent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice">the Blades</a>, and has a time limit. If you don't meet with her within that time limit, the rest of the main quest is completely cut off to you. Even more ironic is that <em>Daggerfall</em> offers a good justification for you to delay the main quest - doing favors and completing quests for the movers and shakers of the Iliac Bay region will make them less inclined to think you are a spy for the Emperor (and doing favours and quests unrelated to your actual <em>mission</em> obfuscates what it is).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">Morrowind</a></em> starts off without the majority of the populace knowing of the looming threat of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Dagoth Ur</a>. (His return, connection to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysticalPlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysticalPlague">Blight</a>, and connection to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">the Nerevarine Prophecies</a> have been covered up by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch">Tribunal Temple</a>.) Your role is as an agent of the Blades, and through the first third of the main quest, you undertake missions to learn more about Dagoth Ur's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil">Sixth House Cult</a> and the Nerevarine Prophecies. As you undertake these missions, it is explicitly recommended to you by your Blades superior to forge a reputation as a freelance adventurer and join some of the guilds/factions in order to establish a cover identity. Later, as the main quest ramps up and it becomes evident that Dagoth Ur is an extreme threat to the future of existence, there is less justification to put off completing the main quest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em>:
<ul><li> The presence of this trope is in extreme conflict with game's main quest. In fact, the <em>tutorial</em> ends with the Emperor's assassination and you very much aware of the threat of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionsOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionsOfHell">invasion from Oblivion</a>. It is heavily implied that time is of the essence as you need to rescue the Emperor's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenBackupPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenBackupPrince">Hidden Backup Prince</a> and recover the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> he needs in order to stop the Oblivion Crisis. However, like the other games in the series, you are perfectly free to wander away for hours to complete unrelated sidequests and explore the massive open world as if nothing is wrong.
</li><li> Even worse, very few of the world's NPCs seem to care or comment about their impending doom, continuing their lives, running their businesses, committing petty crimes, etc. as if nothing is wrong. You'd think a thousand wild conspiracy theories would flourish, but no, everyone agrees it was the magical cult that did it, and that's the end of it. Where's the "Last Seed 27 Truth Movement"?
</li><li> One main quest mission has a demonic doomsday device about to enter the mortal world through an Oblivion Gate, and if you take 15 minutes+ to finish, said device <em>does</em> enter the portal, and you receive a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">Non Standard Game Over</a>. Fortunately you can <em>easily</em> complete the mission in well under the required time limit.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>:
<ul><li> Similar to the state of Cyrodiil in <em>Oblivion</em>, the province of Skyrim is in dire straits. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">Civil War</a> threatens to escalate at any moment, dragons have suddenly returned from thousands of years of presumed extinction, and it is widely known that Alduin, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonsAreDemonic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonsAreDemonic">draconic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastOfTheApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastOfTheApocalypse">Beast of the Apocalypse</a>, has appeared while you are the only person capable of stopping him. But whoa now! What's your rush? You've still got time to join all the local guilds, bring the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderInc">Dark Brotherhood</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThievesGuild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThievesGuild">Thieves' Guild</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheBrink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheBrink">Back from the Brink</a>, become a Thane and buy (or build!) a house in every hold, track down all the Daedric artifacts, get married, adopt some kids, clean out every bandit camp in the country, and mine the ore needed for your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> (oh, and max out your Smithing skill so you can forge it). Alduin can (and does) sit his spiny butt down and wait, you've got shit to do!
</li><li> This even works in the player's favor. Dragons will not start randomly appearing until you complete "Dragon Rising", an early quest in the main quest line. So you can do all of the above without having to deal with dragons if you so choose. The irony is that you're told in the beginning of the game to immediately alert the Jarl of Whiterun about dragons being on the loose, but as long as you don't complete "Dragon Rising," you'll never encounter another dragon attack.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Exile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Exile">Exile</a></em> (Later remade as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Avernum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Avernum">Avernum</a></em>) series:
<ul><li> In the first game, there is no immediate danger to Exile/Avernum, as the Slithzerikai are at a stalemate with the humans, so you can take as much time as you want wandering the underground world. It does apply once you free the demon prince Grah-Hoth from his prison, and are told you need to banish him before he can rebuild his army, but there's no time pressure to do so.
</li><li> In the second game, the introductory text says that every day you waste is another day the Empire can bring down more soldiers, conquer more lands, and kill more people. Despite that, there's no time constraints, and aside from a few towns that are already destroyed by the time you get to them, the Empire never claims more territory, or completes any of its bigger plans.
</li><li> This is finally fixed <em>Exile</em>/<em>Avernum 3</em>. There is a day counter in the game, and if you fail to stop the monster plagues ravaging the continent, towns will end up being damaged, and eventually destroyed and abandoned. Key NPCs would either hide in the ruins, or relocate to more fortified towns that wouldn't be destroyed, so the game was never unwinnable.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EyeOfTheBeholder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EyeOfTheBeholder">Eye of the Beholder</a></em> and its sequels even informed the player about the amount of time that had passed while the party was resting, but no matter how many days you spent sleeping, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> never quite got around to completing his nefarious plans.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableI">Fable I</a></em>, the final sequence of missions has the Hero try (unsuccessfully, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantThwartStageOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantThwartStageOne">You Can't Thwart Stage One</a>) to prevent the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> from recovering the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Artifact of Doom</a> that would let him conquer the world. If you want to take care of some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidequest">Sidequests</a>, shopping, fishing trips, or whatnot, you can tell the Guildmaster that you're not ready, in which case he tells you to finish your business and come back when you want to save the world.
<ul><li> A particularly notorious example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableIII">Fable III</a></em>: After you become King/Queen, you learn that an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> is coming to destroy your kingdom in one year, and you need lots of money to make sure your army is well-equipped and well-trained enough to stand a chance against it. For the next several in-game months, you're faced with several moral choices where you can either screw over the people of your kingdom for the sake of adding more money to the Eldritch Abomination Defense Fund, or take money <em>out</em> of the fund and use it to help the people instead. However, the countdown only changes when you voluntarily trigger the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EventFlags" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EventFlags">Event Flags</a>, so you can take as long as you want adventuring and even becoming a real-estate mogul, the latter of which will easily earn you enough money to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing">The Good King</a> and still meet the money goal by the end of the year.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em>, the shaman in your village give you warnings when you take too long getting the G.E.C.K, but nothing actually happens to the village until you do get it. There's a timed mission in the 2nd game which you <em>heve</em> to complete in several in-game days, however, or you fail.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>, there comes a point in the main questline when the Enclave are about to take control of a vital piece of technology. You can of course, just say you need a while longer, and nothing will happen (apart from some new random encounters). Finally, you can pop back into the Brotherhood of Steel's Citadel, say you are ready, and emerge again to see the Enclave have set up turrets, mortars and troops everywhere during the two minutes you were inside.
<ul><li> Also, at the end when you are following Liberty Prime and the other Brotherhood of Steel troops through DC, if you are with them they will run off ahead at their own pace, with you just appearing to be little more than another rank and file trooper. However, you can wander off and explore the world for weeks and the entire Brotherhood army will just stand about and wait up for you.
</li><li> Enterprising players have discovered that some quest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a> will follow you until you reach a certain destination or complete their quest. If you never actually go to that destination, the NPCs will simply tag along as free backup indefinitely. If you do this in a specific order, you can have as many as seven characters following you (though this prevents you from entering some quest hubs).
</li><li> Then there's the mission "Reilly's Rangers", in which Reilly, who was injured in a super mutant attack, asks you to save the rest of her team, who are pinned down on the roof of a hotel surrounded by a small army of mutants. You're also told that, while fleeing the mutants, the guy carrying the ammo box was killed and they were unable to retrieve it (meaning they're probably low on ammo). You can ignore the urgency and instead go get the Chinese Stealth Armor from the Operation: Anchorage DLC and an Infiltrator from The Pitt (or, even better, The Perforator, a unique version that takes longer to get) to make pushing through an army of heavily armed super mutants easier (which can take weeks) before finally tackling the mission. You get to the roof <em>just</em> in time to help the rangers in a fire fight.
<ul><li> And that's just after getting the quest from Riley. To wake her up you have to use your Medicine skill or use Speech to convince the doctor to do it. If your skills aren't high enough (or you just ignored her)she might have been lying unconscious for weeks or months, but the Rangers will still be just fine.
</li></ul></li><li> For the quest "Those!" Bryan Wilks stays in a cramped single-person fallout shelter while you go deal with the fire breathing giant ants infesting the town. But if you decide you want to finish the quest later, don't worry, he'll still be there. Maybe he sneaks out for food?
</li><li> Then there's Point Lookout, which takes a month of game time to travel to. Any quests you left hanging back in the Wasteland will be unaffected by your time away. Conversely, the 200+ mile rail handcar journey to The Pitt does not pass any game time. Within Point Lookout itself, there's also the quest to destroy a sunken Chinese submarine using detonation codes recovered from the corpse of a pre-War spy - you've only got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysClose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysClose">ten seconds</a> to get away from it once you're out of the sub, but between entering those codes and actually leaving you've got all the time in the world.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> continues this tradition. The second battle of Hoover Dam is about to happen. Every major faction in the game will be participating. And yet, the battle can be delayed as long as it takes for you to do whatever else you want.
<ul><li> In fact, you need to finish the four DLC stories before you finish the game since there is no post-game. <em>Honest Hearts</em> starts with a one-month timeskip on the road to Utah and ends with another one-month timeskip when you return. And since the best time to do the DLC stories is near the end of the main story (when you're at a high level and have decent weapons), the NCR and Legion will be waiting at least two months to finally fight over the Hoover Dam.
</li><li> No matter how long you take, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Benny will wait forever at the Tops for you to show up and foil his plan.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The majority of quests in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> have this, but the Minutemen Radiant quests (helping settlements deal with raiders/super mutants/ghouls/kidnappers) and settlement defense objectives will fail if you don't complete them in time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomsOfAmalurReckoning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomsOfAmalurReckoning">Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning</a></em> has this in full force. That woman who got knifed and lays groaning on the street? Yeah, she can wait a week or two for that first aid you're supposed to be providing.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a></em>, Darth Malak only seems to attack Dantooine after the third piece of the star forge is found. He also doesn't enter the Star Forge no matter how much you doof around playing Pazaak. And during the ending of the first game <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> on the Light side, the Republic Fleet can apparently hold out no matter how much time you spend running around killing mooks before getting to the final fight with Bastila.</span>
<ul><li> Taris also never gets destroyed, but it's justifiable considering that usually, the sith are looking for Bastila and won't glass the planet <em>just</em> yet, as the orbital strike would inevitably lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">Never Found the Body</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the main quests in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em> is actually called "Race Against Time", in which you have to find the Conduit before Saren does. This quest kicks in relatively early in the storyline, and you can Take Your Time for as long as you like - no matter how much time you spend cruising the galaxy prospecting for mineral deposits between advancing plot points, an actual time limit only kicks in when you are actually within sight of your objective (at which point there's nowhere else to go anyway).
<ul><li> Furthermore, once you've <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> stolen the <em>Normandy</em> and become a fugitive from the Citadel</span>, you can complete all of the side quests you want that don't involve going back to the Citadel, even though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the trip to Ilos</span> (the aforementioned Race Against Time) is supposed to be of the utmost importance. If you do any of the sidequests that involve the Alliance, you'll be contacted by Alliance leaders as normally, even though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you've stolen a prototype Alliance warship and committed mutiny.</span>
</li><li> The DLC mission "Bring Down The Sky" tells you repeatedly that you only have a few hours to save Terra Nova. You can take all the time you like to start the mission, and all the time you like to complete it once started, provided you don't start the mission that triggers the end of the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> generally plays this trope straight, but near the end of the game <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Collectors invade the Normandy and kidnap the crew</span> and you're given the option of starting the final mission immediately and entering the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn">Point of No Return</a> or choosing to wait. You can choose to wait, but you can only do <em>one</em> mission. More than one, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">half your crew will die in a most horrific fashion</span> by the time you get to them. Do more than two sidequests and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">only Doctor Chakwas survives</span>. Considering that the aforementioned penultimate mission involves the recruitment of a character (thus restricting your time spent with them if you want the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a>), this is a clear example of why so many consider this trope an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">Acceptable Break From Reality</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> has a strange relationship with this trope: Earth and quite a few other of the most important and influential planets of the galaxy are under attack by the Reapers from literally the first few minutes of the game, and the majority of the game's atmospheric background NPC chatter and flavor text emphasises how every minute you spend running around the galaxy, people are dying in droves; the main plot-advancing missions are identified by the label "Priority." In general, Priority missions are the only ones <em>not</em> on a time limit - these will wait as long as the player likes, whereas optional sidequests left undone will often expire after the main storyline has progressed passed a certain point, often with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerPunch">tragic consequences</a>. Then there are a few that just disappear into limbo; if you don't complete the notoriously buggy hanar diplomat mission before Priority: Tuchanka, you never find out anything about what happened, it's not clear whether Bau managed to solve the problem or not, and the planet Kahje spends the entire rest of the war in a state of quantum indeterminacy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a></em> continues to follow this one. Those other Arks? They'll keep. Liam's got a friend in trouble? Jaal's got a family crisis? Hey, why not drive around Eos looking for that mineral sample you said you'd find. No rush, after all.
<ul><li> The exception is one mission, involving the kett fighting each other. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leave it until after defeating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and all the enemies you would have had to fight have been murdered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> and her forces, and instead of aforementioned deal, you get messages from the Dragon outlying what her plan of action is now that she's in charge.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a></em> series had very few timed quests, although the degree to which this trope applies to the <em>main</em> quests varies — <em>Might &amp; Magic VIII</em> is a strong offender, as there's an approaching threat (a planar invasion) that never actually manifests no matter how long you take doing other things, while in <em>VII</em> the plot is almost entirely driven by the player characters' actions, and one of the few quest arcs that isn't actually <em>is</em> timed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeopetsTheDarkestFaerie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeopetsTheDarkestFaerie">Neopets: The Darkest Faerie</a></em>, they justify this in the last act, set in a city trapped in slowed time, meaning that you <em>can</em> Take Your Time and return in time to defeat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights">Neverwinter Nights</a></em> games, this trope is handily illustrated by their various attempts to bring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInn">resting</a> from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> rules into the games, allowing players to interrupt any crisis with a representation of what is supposed to be an 8-hour nap, including sometimes in short breaks in the midst of battle.
<ul><li> In the expansion <em>Storm of Zehir</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInn">resting</a> is restricted to actual beds and outdoor camping (somewhat at the price of the complexity of dungeons, all of which needed to be surmountable without the benefit of resting). Still, the possibility remains of going into a dungeon, fleeing from the horrors inside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsurmountableWaistHighFence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsurmountableWaistHighFence">out the front door</a>, setting up camp literally <em>on their doorstep</em>, and charging back in with a full night's rest - said horrors, of course, politely refraining from trying to escape or pursue you.
</li></ul></li><li> In the old SSI <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> RPG, <em>Secret of the Silver Blades</em>, your party can rest for up to 99 days at a time, as often as you like, and the Black Circle will be no closer to freeing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Dreadlord</a> from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">icy prison</a> until just before the PCs get there.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaUnderworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaUnderworld">Ultima Underworld</a> II</em>, everyone has been trapped in Castle British by the Guardian's spell, and problems like running out of food and water are explicitly alluded to. Despite this, the plot only progresses when you make it. This is particularly odd given that the game does have a time system, you can sleep to pass time and check the time on your pocket watch, but still nothing significant happens without the player character triggering it.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVII">Ultima VII</a></em> the planetary alignment of course does not actually occur until you reach the chamber of the Black Gate.
</li></ul></li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder23');">    Wide Open Sandbox </div><div class="folder" id="folder23" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAmazingSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAmazingSpiderMan">The Amazing Spider-Man</a></em> does this frequently. Several missions lure you into a false sense of urgency (quick, the Spider-Slayer is heading to your apartment to capture <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Connors</span> - better hurry! Gwen is infected with a virus...she's running out of time!), but the story won't progress until you head to the objective marker. You can spend hours looking for comic pages, doing side missions or swinging around the city and no one will do anything until you start a plot mission. Though Spider-Man won't shut up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinueYourMissionDammit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinueYourMissionDammit">about it till its done</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity">Batman: Arkham City</a></em>, despite Hugo Strange stating the countdown till Protocol 10 throughout the game <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and the fact you are rapidly dying from blood poisoning</span>, you can pretty much do whatever you want between the main mission from completing side missions, finding Riddler Trophies, or just beat up random mooks for fun.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EndlessOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EndlessOcean">Endless Ocean</a></em> proudly wears this idea on its sleeve, with in-game characters constantly assuring you that there's no pressure on when you should complete tasks assigned to you.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a>: The Game</em>, there are some missions that imply time pressure, such as going to the hospital after Don Vito gets shot, but if there's no explicit timer you can spend your time extorting businesses, taking hit contracts and generally ambling around aimlessly as long as you like.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> series largely averts this, as it's rife with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">Timed Missions</a>, but there are a few classic Take Your Time moments. In particular, throughout all the recent installments, random gang leaders instruct you to "get to the payphone in [district]," implying that they're calling <em>right now</em>. You, of course, can wait on it for in-game weeks, and the phone will always be ringing.
<ul><li> Humorously averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV">IV</a></em>. At one point early on, you can go on a date or help out your cousin from getting beaten up. If you choose the former, your cousin calls you afterwards, complaining that you didn't help him out. The mission still happens regardless, though.
<ul><li> The same thing happens at the end <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with Roman's wedding. It's scheduled for 10:30 AM, but if you miss it, Roman will call and complain but will allow you to come the next day. You can miss it as many times as you want.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> If you do exceptionally poorly in a gunfight, it is possible to escape and grab some lunch (restoring your health), and buy more armor and guns before returning to the fight.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InFAMOUS2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InFAMOUS2">inFAMOUS 2</a></em> has a screen that comes up whenever loading a game and between chapters stating how far The Beast is from arriving in New Marais, and Cole is often told he needs to hurry to find the Blast Cores to power the RFI so he can fight it, but no matter how many side quest you go on or how long you spend doing player-made missions, The Beast doesn't arrive until you follow the plot missions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MiddleEarthShadowOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MiddleEarthShadowOfWar">Middle-earth: Shadow of War</a></em>:
<ul><li> During Act I, Talion is assisting in the defense of Minas Ithil as its being besieged by Sauron's armies. Despite the city hanging by a thread, you are allowed to advance time either by your own choice or being killed by your enemies, pursue side activities and such that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the city will not fall until you advance in the storyline</span>.
</li><li> In Carnan's questline, you must deal with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut">Balrog</a> that has been unleashed on Mordor and will cause unspeakable devastation if left unchecked. At this point in the game, the map has opened up quite a lot and you are allowed to explore other regions and perform several activities without worrying about the Balrog, since he will not interfere in your side-activities.
</li></ul></li><li> Although John Marston of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption">Red Dead Redemption</a></em> implies that he has only a small window of time to collect his former outlaw mates before his family dies a horrible death, you are free to take as long as you need to complete his quest.
<ul><li> <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> still has shades of this trope even if you focus entirely on the main plot. Many story characters will end their quests by asking John to meet them somewhere for the next stage of the quest or telling you to go see some other character to start their questline. But generally speaking you can do these quests in whatever order you please, leading to some awkward pauses in the middle of certain questlines.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In what's probably the apex of this trope, all of the sidequests except one can be started at any time, left dormant, and then completed after the storyline has been beatenat which point <em>John Marston will have been killed, three years will have passed, and you'll have started playing as his son Jack</em>. So it's entirely possible to begin a sidequest as John and complete it with hia grown son, with none of the characters noticing that an entirely different person started working for them.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Mason can take his time in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedFactionGuerrilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedFactionGuerrilla">Red Faction: Guerrilla</a></em>: The commander thinks Sam might be walking into an ambush — get over there right now! Or later! When you feel like it!
<ul><li> This also applies <em>within</em> many missions. You can take as long as you need to recover from one fight before tackling the next; if the enemies are really giving you trouble, try holding position and letting them come to you to thin out their numbers. If you accept a mission to rescue prisoners, the EDF will learn nothing useful from them until you arrive. And in the final mission, you can scale Mt. Vogel as slowly and carefully as you please, and chill at the top for as long as you want — with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">Death from Above</a> on a <em>planetary scale</em> mere moments away!
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Subnautica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Subnautica">Subnautica</a></em>, your character is infected with a virus that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is responsible for killing billions of aliens</span>, but there's nothing stopping you from building your underwater base for as long as you like. Then again, considering your exposure to the imperfect cure contained within <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Peepers, which were essentially <em>made</em> to spread the curing enzyme everywhere and which you'll have likely dined upon frequently</span>, it's understandable.
