Given fickle nature of the shogun and the schemes of Chancellor Yanagisawa, merely being fired isn't usually an option, though. At best, it's likely exile; at worst, it's execution. So far, Sano has only manged to be demoted once, but he's since made a comeback to his previous position.

His consulting firm is regularly hired by companies that want to justify massive unnecessary layoffs of qualified personnel in order to manipulate their stock prices. Then a few weeks later, the companies realize that they can't meet their business obligations after laying off a large portion of their manpower, so hire the same firm to act as a headhunter, at which point Jim rehires all the people he had just sacked.

<ul><li> In "How to Succeed in Business?" after Mike and Carol find out that Peter had lost his job as a mechanic at a bike shop, Mike assures his middle son that failure and getting fired are a part of life. He states explicitly, "I've lost jobs" — although he was likely referring more to his company losing contracts for jobs they had bid and clients firing his firm. When it came to clients firing Mike:
</li><li> It is narrowly averted in "Sorry, Right Number," whereby a hard-nosed company executive is about to complete a deal for a lucrative contract when a telephone operator cuts in, asking Mike to pay 10 cents to continue the call (on a payphone installed at his home). The executive is about to fire Mike when Mike miraculously explains the payphone situation (he was using it to teach the kids responsibility, manners and money management ... and none of the other phones were available).
</li><li> Mike is fired outright in "Mike's Horror-scope" ... although it wasn't a bad thing, since his client was the impossible-to-please executive of a cosmetics company that wanted to make a hilariously, impossibly designed building.
</li><li> At least twice, his boss, Mr. Phillips, threatens to let Mike go. The first is in "Double Parked," after the boss learns that Carol is heading up an effort to save a neighborhood park where the company is seeking to build a new courthouse and Mike balks after he is told to tell Carol to cease and desist. The other is after Carol — who was under Mike's strict orders to not use the phone, to rest her voice after having her tonsils removed — unknowingly insults Mr. Phillips during a phone call; she had thought it to be Mike to test her, and when Mike tries to call Mr. Phillips back to explain, he gets a short retort and an earful of telephone slam.

</li><li> "Green Card": All of the tree pushers get fired as a result of there being no more trees to push down (as Richfield says, they've outlived their usefulness). However, they eventually get hired back to work on a project to build a wall on swamp land to keep the four-legged dinosaurs from entering their land.
</li><li> "A New Leaf": After bringing the "happy plant" to work and being dopey form its effects, Richfield fires Earl, who is all too happy to be fired. When Fran finds out, she brings Earl to work to talk Richfield into rehiring him. At this point, Richfield had taken the plant and is a hippy. He's happy to not only rehire Earl but also make him his assistant.... Only for Richfield to get a call from his superior telling him that he's fired (which also means Earl is still fired). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack">And we never see Richfield or Earl get their jobs back at the end of the episode</a>.</span>

After Earl rubs in his new wealth, Richfield then fires all of his tree pushers and says its because of the company losses.

Let's just say it's a very bad idea to work there if your last name is Johnson. The main character loses his job multiple times, yet always manages to get it back, though the timeframe can vary from within one episode to over two seasons. Wick's wacky firing schemes do eventually blow up in his face, though, as one of them ends with him taking a crossbow bolt to the junk and losing a testicle.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDukesOfHazzard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDukesOfHazzard">The Dukes of Hazzard</a></em>: Several times, Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane and/or his deputies, Cletus Hogg and/or Enos Strate, have been fired by Boss Hogg.
<ul><li> Rosco's highest-profile firing was in "Robot P. Coltrane," when Rosco  who had been Hazzard County's top cop for 25 years  let the Duke boys slip from his grasp, but a robot  a ROBOT!  easily subdued the Dukes. It turned out that was the last straw in a series of his mistakes, as Boss enumerates every minor slip-up or goof his sheriff had made. Of course, Rosco is rehired by episode's end, as the robot shorts out.
</li><li> Enos was let go at least twice, most famously in "Enos Strate to the Top," the pilot for <em>Enos</em> (his own hour-long police dramadey). His departure comes when he stands up to Boss and declares once and for all that he is through harassing the Duke family on his orders. In the 1984 episode "The Ransom of Hazzard County," Enos is given a <em>de facto</em> dismissal when Boss loses patience with his honesty (he is demoted to records clerk); however, Enos will play a key role in capturing his successor, who is conspiring with a pair of extortion artists to blow up Hazzard Dam if Boss doesn't pay him $1 million.

Jerry for this reason declines the request and his boss sacks him. Jerry's friend Tom Good tries to convince Sir to hire Jerry back but learns only at the end that Sir had never intended the firing to be permanent but only meant to teach Jerry not to think of himself as irreplaceable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em>:
<ul><li> Houses employees live in perpetual terror of being fired, but barring the mass interview, the chances of anyone actually staying gone are slim to none.
</li><li> They don't even <em>always</em> stay gone during the mass interview. During the "mass" part of the mass interview when House is still having everyone wear numbered tags so he doesn't have to remember their names, one character who is fired just turns his tag upside down and claims to be a different number. House notices and calls him out on it, but considers it good initiative and lets him stay anyway.
</li><li> In "Dying Changes Everything" the doormat Patient Of the Week casually mentions in the middle of the episode that she was replaced from her job as the personal assistant to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist">Straw Feminist</a> activist despite having been gone for a few days at most and being committed to a hospital for a <em>potentially life threatening illness</em>. At the episode's end, the replacement quits and the patient is offered the same job with increased autonomy and she accepts, much to Thirteen's disappointment who wanted her to take the opportunity to make a new life for herself. No one considers the more logical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">third option</a> of the assistant suing the employer for wrongful termination and winning an enormous settlement.

However, Florence saves her job when, while listening in on another phone conversation, she overhears a potential client of George's confer with his partner ... to close out a scam deal over damaged delivery vans! The trope became less frequent and, by the end of the series' run, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateJobSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateJobSecurity">it had gone away completely</a>.

<ul><li> In the episode with Nancy Walker, Kermit got sick and put Fozzie in charge. After all that happened in the episode, as it was about to end Fozzie figured Kermit would fire him. Kermit then shows up and tells Fozzie that he's fired. However, Fozzie seems to be more happy to see Kermit back than concerned about his firing, and Kermit quickly tells him that he's hired again.

<div class="indent"><strong>George:</strong> Nobody knows what this guy's capable of. He fires people like it's a bodily function!

In the same episode, Grandpa apologizes for eleven of those times, but not the most recent. (He's <em>not</em> sorry about that one.)

In the episode "Fare Thee Welfare," George is impeached by Vice President Dick Cheney.

Even after Jack got his own restaurant, Mr. Angelino was his landlord and repeatedly threatened not to renew Jack's lease.
</li><li> Played for drama in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VazelinaHjulkalender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VazelinaHjulkalender">Vazelina Hjulkalender</a></em>. Inga fires Synnøve because Synnøve could have forced the wreckers to move, but refused to. Synnøve didn't have a lot of money in the first place, and having lost her job doesn't help her or her children.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock">30 Rock</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the episode "Rosemary's Baby", Jack fired Liz when she refused to fire a guest writer with edgy ideas. Also, Jack fired Pete for no apparent reason in the pilot, rehiring him at the end of the episode at Liz's insistence. Liz feared being fired when she confronted Jack about how he was taking over the writers' room in "Jack the Writer". In "The Fighting Irish", Liz fired her romantic rival and, when Pete and the accounting department objected, she responded by firing them all. Pete was obviously rehired again as was Liz's rival, who was then promoted to a branch office.
</li><li> Jack does quite a lot of firing. Jonathan's gotten fired three times in the first three seasons. Kenneth got fired for about a minute in "Blind Date". Jack spent all episode firing people in "Cutbacks". And in a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a>, Jack fired Tracy from his <em>community-service job</em> as a Little League coach in "Cougars" and rehires him later in the episode.

John's boss, newspaper publisher Mr. Callahan, insists upon helping the two investigate, but not before having a drink or several in the local pub. A paperboy hands Callahan an advance copy of the late edition, and Callahan, enraged at several typos in the copy, tells the bartender to inform his copy boy when he sees him next that he's fired, and storms off. The bartender assures the shocked Ingalls and Edwards that Callahan is actually quite a fine and decent man, and assures them that he "fires" said copy boy at least a couple of times a week.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Homer doesn't lose his job as frequently, but it's happened enough to notice, and Mr. Burns has as lax a set of criteria for firing employees as his predecessors. This has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> with Homer casually mentioning that he can participate in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme">Zany Scheme</a> because he has been fired again.
<div class="indent"><strong>Bart:</strong> Do you even have a job anymore? <br/><strong>Homer:</strong> I think it's pretty obvious that I don't!
</div></li><li> Also lampshaded by a related gag where Mr. Burns never remembers Homer's name, for better or worse.
</li><li> Lampshaded <em>again</em>, when a family member comes up with some wacky caper or other and Homer says "That's a great idea! And it's perfect timing, because I just got fired!"
</li><li> This example might be more of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateJobSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateJobSecurity">a subversion</a>, actually, since the only times Burns actually seems to sack Homer are when he's done things that really <em>are</em> examples of gross incompetence and stupidity. Burns never fired Homer for suing him after he hit Bart with a car, or for standing up to Burns when he sexually harassed Marge, or even for thwarting Burns' campaign for governor. Another way it's a subversion is that Homer seems to be able to get his job back despite his incredible incompetence and gross stupidity.
</li><li> And then there's the rally to the top of the mountain in ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS8E12MountainOfMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS8E12MountainOfMadness">Mountain of Madness</a>". Last team in is fired. Averted at the end when Burns pretty much says that he never intended to fire anybody, it was just to motivate them.
</li><li> Although it DOES appear that the (lack of) job security applies to everyone:
<div class="indent"><strong>Carl:</strong> Hey Mr. Burns, can I have a raise? <br/><strong>Mr. Burns:</strong> (cheerfully) Clear out your desk, you're gone!
</div></li><li> And then there was what happened to Lenny:
<div class="indent"><strong>Mr. Burns</strong>: Alright, let's make this sporting, Leonard. If you can tell me why I shouldn't fire you without using the letter "E", you can keep your job!" <br/><strong>Lenny</strong>: Uh...okay...I'm a good...work...guy... <br/><strong>Mr. Burns</strong>: You're fired. <br/><strong>Lenny</strong>: But I didn't say- <br/><strong>Mr. Burns</strong>: You will. <em>(opens the trapdoor Lenny is standing on)</em> <br/><strong>Lenny</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo">EEEEEEEE!</a>
</div></li><li> Also lampshaded in the comic once, after being fired <em>again</em>, Homer brushes it off saying "If I didn't get fired now and then, I'd never spend any time with the kids."
</li><li> Burns has even fired his loyal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan">Yes-Man</a> Smithers <em>twice</em>. Both times, it didn't last. (In fact, in the alternate ending to "Who Shot Mr. Burns", he would have forgiven Smithers for <em>trying to kill him</em> and hiring him again with no more punishment than a small pay cut.)
</li><li> This could be explained by Mr. Burns' philosophy that keeping Homer on staff is the only way to ensure he can make Homer suffer and fear him— A "Keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer" type of thing. He said as much in "Burns Verkaufen du Kraftwerk".
</li><li> After his divorce, Kirk Van Houten was actually fired from the cracker company for <em>being single</em>. Though since Kirk apparently got the job from Luann's father he may have only have gotten to stay there as a favor, or possibly the firing <em>was to get back at him for the divorce.</em> He was noted to be the worst employee at the company, causing it to fall behind a rival brand (one of the subjects mentioned in one of their fights prior to or during the divorce), so remaining employed beyond that incident was likely a favor from Luann's father.
</li><li> Another interpretation is that Homer's <em>real</em> job is to fill the position of "safety inspector" without any of the trouble or expense of actually discovering and correcting safety problems, making it more a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VetinariJobSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VetinariJobSecurity">Vetinari Job Security</a> from Mr. Burns' point of view.
</li><li> In the episode "Realty Bites", Marge becomes a real estate broker in an attempt to deal with yet another bout of boredom and is hired by Read Blazer Estates, with Lionel Hutz as a boss. She doesn't even makes it to the end of the day before Hutz warns her that he has a policy of firing any agents that don't sell any houses within a week of being hired, leading to her deciding to not tell Ned Flanders that the dream house he rushed to purchase from her was the site of a notorious multiple murder.

<ul><li> Roman Abramovich of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishFootyTeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishFootyTeams">Chelsea FC</a> is almost as bad as Mr. Spacely. Current manager Frank Lampard, who has been in the post since the start of the 201920 season, is the <em>twelfth</em> different manager since 2004. The rundown: Claudio Ranieri, José Mourinho, Avram Grant, Luiz Felipe Scolari, Guus Hiddink, Carlo Ancelotti, André Villas-Boas, Roberto di Matteo, Rafa Benítez, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesBack">Mourinho again, Hiddink again</a> and Antonio Conte. It's hard not to feel sorry for di Matteo - Abramovich's actions showed that he didn't want him as the manager, and only after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Pep Guardiola</a> made it clear that he was taking a sabbatical did he appoint di Matteo as the manager. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2236606/Roberto-Di-Matteo-sacked-Chelsea-Roman-Abramovich-Inside-story-Neil-Ashton.html">Abramovich constantly interfering didn't help<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and di Matteo was out by November.
</li><li> Similarly, the position of Real Madrid manager was practically a game of hot potato during the mid-late 2000's "Galáctico Era". Between Vicente del Bosque's departure in 2003 and José Mourinho's appointment in 2010, Los Blancos practically had more than one coaching change each year, with nine coaches <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14t3m');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note14t3m" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14t3m');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The list: Carlos Queiroz, Jose Antonio Camacho, Mariano Garcia Remon, Vanderlei Luxemburgo, Juan Ramón López Caro, Fabio Capello, Bernd Schuster, Juande Ramos, and Manuel Pellegrini </span> going through the Real hot seat in just SEVEN YEARS. These rapid changes of management proved to be extremely detrimental to Real's success, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">as the club managed to snare a grand total of only</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">'''two major trophies'''</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">in that time period</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">despite hosting the likes of David Beckham, Ruud Van Nistelrooy, Raúl, and Fabio Cannavaro.</a> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2lbpt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2lbpt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2lbpt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">To put things into perspective, bitter rivals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Barcelona</a> had only two managers (Frank Rijkaard and Pep Guardiola) and <strong>SEVEN major trophies</strong> in the same timespan. </span>
<ul><li> And the 201819 seasona poor one by their normal standards, which saw them finish third, not making any kind of challenge to champions Barcelona or second-place Atlético Madridsaw Real go through <em>three</em> managers. First, Julen Lopetegui was sacked at the end of October after a string of poor results, ending in a 51 humiliation at Barça. Santiago Solari then righted the ship to some degree, but didn't do enough to keep from being shown the door in March. Real then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesBack">brought back</a> former manager Zinedine Zidane.

Eventually the engineers got used to this and just continued to show up for work.
</li><li> New York Yankees manager Billy Martin, whom owner George Steinbrenner fired in 1979. And 1983, 1985, and 1988. At the time of his death in 1989, he was preparing to pick up the managing reins <em>again</em> for the 1990 season. Years later it came to light that despite his many firings Martin was never once taken off the Yankees payroll. Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> at one point <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMQH_vDovs">during a press conference announcing his return<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> as well as on a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agZEMEpiVI">1978 Miller Lite commercial<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>:

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardWilliams">Richard Williams</a> has been known to fire numerous animators for not living up to his (admittedly high) standards of fluid, perfect animation.

</li><li> Arguably the most notable example in football (soccer) is Maurizio Zamparini, chairman of the Italian club Palermo from 2002 to 2018, except for a few months in 2017. Since 1987 he has made (as of the end of his final spell at Palermo in December 2018) 67 managerial changes, including 43 while in charge of Palermo. Several managers have been hired and fired multiple times. In the 2012/2013 season alone he fired Giuseppe Sannino after three weeks, replaced him with Gian Piero Gasperini, who was in turn turfed out in favour of Alberto Malesani, who was fired 19 days later and replaced by... Gian Piero Gasperini. Gasperini's second spell lasted less than two weeks before he was fired and replaced by none other than Giuseppe Sannino, the coach from the start of the season. Zamparini's last managerial changes at Palermo began with hiring Bruno Tedino in 2017, followed by swapping Tedino and Roberto Stellone <em>three times</em>.
</li><li> Watford FC under the Pozzo family has become this, with 10 managers in the fold <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3hb9q');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3hb9q" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3hb9q');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Gianfranco Zola, Giuseppe Sanino, Óscar García Junyent, Billy McKinlay, Slavia Jokanović, Quique Sánchez Flores, Walter Mazzari, Marco Silva, Javi Gracia, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesBack">Flores again</a> and Nigel Pearson, with Hayden Mullins being caretaker manager between Flores second time and Pearson and again after the latters sacking</span> since the Pozzos took over the club in 2012. (This amounts to around 1.6 managers per year!) Success is not even a guarantee for job survival as Watford manager, as Jokanovic was canned after helping Watford earn promotion to the Premier League and Sánchez was let go despite leading the Hornets to a comfortable mid-table finish (a remarkable feat for a newly-promoted club) and the FA Cup Semifinal. Watford fans don't really mind this, as the club has been relatively successful (especially compared to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Luton</a>) under the Pozzos.
<ul><li> These firings can be chalked up to the Pozzos' ambitions and their desire to turn Watford into a world-class club akin to Man United, Liverpool, Chelsea etc. After all, a midtable finish is not enough when you have talented players like Miguel Britos, Odion Ighalo, Juan Zuñiga, Sebastian Prödl, Troy Deeney, and Roberto Pereyra. Not helping is the fact that other clubs have accomplished more with less big-name talent (*cough* Leicester City, RB Leipzig *cough*)
</li></ul></li><li> Amazon.com, while not noted for its firings, tends to have absurdly high rate standards (pick rate at 100% is an estimated 1200 picks per day which turns out to be a pick every 1/2 minute). Given that most workers are temps until "converted" this means potentially every new worker has this type of job. On the bright side, they are a good holiday employer.
</li><li> American Apparel randomly requires its employees to submit full-body photographs to its HR departments. Anybody who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely">isn't pretty enough</a> is labeled "off-brand" and released from the company. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Why were they hired in the first place?</a> Female employees can be (and have been) fired when they refuse owner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeanAndMean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeanAndMean">Dov Charney's</a> sexual advances.

</li><li> Similarly, many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball">American Football</a> teams can go though numerous head coaches, coordinators, and players every season. Especially true for perpetually under-performing teams where you're lucky to get more than a year or two to show improvement or it's out the door and on to the next team. Many professional sports have players/coaches who've changed teams so often that they are considered "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">journeymen</a>", only hired to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage">So Okay, It's Average</a> placeholders until better talent comes along. During training camp and even late in the season, it's not uncommon to have a player be cut or waived and then resigned a couple days later, depending on how the season is going.
</li><li> Many companies in the US implement what is known as at-will employment. That is, the employer can fire the employee for any reason or no reason at all. However, the employee can also leave the company for any reason or no reason. Neither party needs to have a just cause for termination of employment. <br/><br/>Interestingly, the USA has a few reasons why someone <em>can't</em> be fired; a specified employment contract, race, religion, gender<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note44pow');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note44pow" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note44pow');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">At least not specifically; an infamous court case ruled that women could be fired for being too attractive and thus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAManICantHelpIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAManICantHelpIt">a threat to the employer's marriage</a></span>, disability (as long as it doesn't interfere with your job), and a few others. Except for those, you can be fired for any reason, since almost everyone practices "at-will employment". Boss doesn't like your haircut? You can be fired. 12.3 percent of wage and salary workers are members of a union, which makes them harder to get rid of... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange">but also makes it harder to get rid of bad coworkers and employees</a>. <br/><br/><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInAmerica">This is a very American trope</a>, as many European countries have laws that make firing someone on a whim nigh-impossible. It's not unheard of for multinational corporations doing a corporate-wide layoff to let US employees go several months before their European counterparts, because it takes that much longer to jump through the hoops required by the legal system there.

Since then, injuries, poor performances, and just plain old misfortune (in the form of a career-ending Staph infection) have cause the Bucs to churn out THIRTEEN kickers (Mike Nugent, Shane Andrus, Connor Barth, Lawrence Tynes <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5hg5m');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5hg5m" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5hg5m');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">whose career ended</a> due to the aforementioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury">Staph Infection</a>)</span>, Rian Lindell, Patrick Murray, Kyle Brindza, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Connor Barth (again)</a>, Robert Aguayo <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6rk56');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6rk56" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6rk56');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">drafted relatively high (in the 2nd round) for a special-teamer</a>, but managed to become the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">WORST KICKER of the 2016 season, ranking dead last in field goal percentage</a>)</span>, Nick Folk, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Patrick Murray (yet again)</a>, Chandler Catanzaro, and (as of now, at least) Cairo Santos) in just the span of ONE decade.

</li><li> In the American imagination, being involved in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMafia">The Mafia</a> means being well-dressed, surrounded by women, and driving expensive cars. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Reality Ensues</a> as a mafioso's life is actually monotonous, boring, and sometimes horrendous. They must have good rackets in order to avoid being a long-term problem for their bosses, and kick a portion of said earnings upstairs. Anything they do are "put on record" or "registered" with their capo so that they'll profit from these rackets and plan further schemes. At the same time, they must avoid law enforcement heat. In recent years, thanks to increasing pressure from the law, mobsters turning informer, and long prison sentences, many mobsters can only manage to barely scrape by.
</li><li> The world of academia has become very much like this - graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and other early-career people are usually employed on casual or short fixed-term payment contracts that terminate very swiftly, with no official mechanism for renewal or extension, and no prospect of ever getting a permanent position. This allows a large turnover of people at the whims of supervisors and department heads. Graduate (doctoral) students especially, many of whom fall into a sort of quasi-employment state between student and faculty, are often in the position where their funding (i.e. where any stipend/salary comes from) can be cut at any time by a disgruntled supervisor, unless there's some sort of external contract involved. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">And everyone in academia is conditioned from the start to think that this all somehow acceptable, and actually ''good'' for you</a>.

Once you have that, it's next to impossible to fire them for anything short of truly egregious (as in, actually <em>illegal</em>, and sometimes not even then) misconduct. As a result of the extremely high job security employees <em>with</em> tenure have, you get the above situation of employees <em>without</em> tenure having extremely low job security.
