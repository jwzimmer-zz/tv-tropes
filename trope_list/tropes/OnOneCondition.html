There is, of course, a catch in the will that must be obeyed. Should it be violated, everything will pass to another person.
</p><p>The catch is usually one of the following:
</p><p></p><ul><li> The character must spend the night in the deceased's impossibly large mansion, which may or may not be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedHouse">Haunted House</a>. Either way, expect someone in the will to adopt a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise">transparent</a> ghost disguise (perhaps a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bedsheetghost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bedsheetghost">bedsheet</a>) and try to disqualify everyone else by scaring them off.
</li><li> The character is explicitly warned they must not harm "X" — which prompts "X" to move in with them and become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThingThatWouldNotLeave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThingThatWouldNotLeave">shameless moocher</a>.
</li><li> The character must marry, either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">a specific person</a>, or simply marry <em>someone</em>.
</li><li> The character simply must stay alive, because the will stipulates another will inherit all if anything "unforeseen" happens to the main character. This is usually a setup for said secondary character to try and kill off the primary beneficiary and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident">Make It Look Like an Accident</a>.
</li></ul><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The catch is essentially a foreshadowed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">quickly restore the status quo</a>, since making the characters of a show extremely wealthy will almost always kill the inherent drama or central premise of the show by implying that they could simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney">buy their way out</a> of whatever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme">Zany Scheme</a> they got into.
</p><p>Thus, unless an inheritance is part of the plot from the start, whatever the character inherits, they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyComeEasyGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyComeEasyGo">going to blow it</a> by the end. They may do so by accident or purposely after deciding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityIsOverrated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityIsOverrated">Celebrity Is Overrated</a> and no amount of wealth is worth the humiliating restrictions.
</p><p>A common subversion is for the characters to <em>not</em> blow the catch, but end up with nothing because the estate is heavily in debt and is promptly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaxmanTakesTheWinnings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaxmanTakesTheWinnings">seized by a bank or the IRS</a> for back taxes.
</p><p>Another way to play it is to make the inheritance "worthless", as in a promised collection of "priceless" artwork turns out to be a pile of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsIncomprehensible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsIncomprehensible">incomprehensible impressionist scribbles</a> that are only "priceless" in that no one could ever be found who actually wanted to <em>buy</em> them. Or, it could simply be "worth-less", as in they get Great Uncle Beaureguard's $1 million fortune, but it's Confederate money. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, it would actually be worth a pretty penny to collectors, but obviously no longer worth face value.

</li></ul></li><li> A Japanese variant found in a number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">anime</a> series involves the heir to some sort of unwanted family business needing to fulfill the condition to <em>avoid</em> having to devote their life to a career that they hate, or an unwanted arranged marriage. Examples of this include:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WJuliet">W Juliet</a></em>: Makoto's father is set to inherit the Narita family dojo unless he lives as a girl and successfully hides his true gender until his high school graduation.

The catch is that the riddle describes the ritual to revive the witch who supposedly gave him the gold, and <em>someone's</em> killing off everyone on the island in accordance with it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HanaukyoMaidTai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HanaukyoMaidTai">Hanaukyō Maid Tai</a></em> (both series), Ryuuka Jihiyou's grandfather told her she'd succeed him as the head of the Jihiyou family if she marries the head of the Hanaukyo family, Taro Hanaukyo. Despite not (initially) liking Taro, she has no qualms about fulfilling said condition. However, Taro told her he didn't know her enough to know if he'd like to be her husband or not. In order to get him to know her, she decides to become one of his several maids.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> episode "Holy Matrimony" had Jessie, Meowth, and the "twerps" learning that James came from a wealthy family. Not wanting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">to marry the woman they wanted him to</a> (who happens to look <em>exactly</em> like Jesse), he ran away from home and joined Team Rocket. In that episode, James' parents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead">faked their deaths</a> and their butler mentioned that, unless James gets married within the next 24 hours, their fortune would go to charity.

While Suzuka and her parents were all officially declared dead, Yoshimi got the whole money until Suzuka was found.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KonoNakaNiHitoriImoutoGaIru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KonoNakaNiHitoriImoutoGaIru">Kono Naka ni Hitori, Imouto ga Iru!</a></em>, Shougo Mikadono's father was the leader of a large business conglomerate but has now died and left in his will that Shougo inherits the fortune left behind. The catch is that he has to go to a certain school to meet a suitable wife. While that in itself isn't a big deal, in the first episode a girl talks to him through a high window and claims to be his biological sister. She says she's going to marry him, also attends the same school, and to make matters worse, she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">won't reveal who she is!</a> So poor Shougo has to figure out which of the many girls clamoring over him is his sister, so as to avoid marrying her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's ultimately revealed in the light novels (the anime ended before that point since the novels had yet to finish) that they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings">Not Blood Siblings</a> - while Konoe, the girl who'd spoken to him, is indeed Kumagoro Mikadono's biological daughter, Shougo is <em>not</em> Kumagoro's biological son. Consequently, they can safely have a relationship.</span>

A character brings up a scenario where a man bequeaths $10 million to be split between his two sons on the condition the sons agree on how much each one will receive otherwise they don't get anything. The eldest son suggests getting $8 million while the youngest gets the remaining two. The character who brings it up asks another character what he'd do in the youngest's place. He answers that he'd rather get nothing than let his brother get more.

After preventing some crooks' attempt to steal the money, their leader finally explains what's really happening: an eccentric millionaire named Carl Verril, in an effort to get his son Vincent to learn to respect money, bequeathed one million dollars to him on the condition that he spend it all in four days without investing more than one hundred thousand dollars on any one purchase and without making any money. If he does so, he gets ten million dollars. If he doesn't, Carl's nephew Larry gets the ten million. Unfortunately, the very night Vincent was informed of the terms of his father's will, he needed an emergency operation and couldn't spend the money by himself, so he made a deal with Batman: Batman does the spending for him and, in return, Vincent will donate nine million dollars for charity and keep only one million for himself. The lawyer accepted the idea on the condition that Batman never tells anyone why he needs to spend the million dollars. Larry then hired some thugs to steal the money so it won't be spent. After learning all of this, Superman helps Batman by selling him ten trophies of Superman's past adventures for one hundred thousand dollars each - receiving the full million in total. Which he promptly donates to charity.

Donald had previously located a sunken yacht belonging to Scrooge and offered to salvage it for fifty thousand dollars but Scrooge refused to pay more than two thousand dollars for it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After Scrooge sabotaged Donald's other attempts to earn that money, Donald accepted Scrooge's proposition. To further antagonize Donald, Scrooge saw to it that all conventional means to salvage the yacht would cost Donald three thousand dollars. Donald and his nephews then tried to outsmart Scrooge by buying several loads of ping-pong balls to float the yacht back to the surface. When Donald collected the inheritance, he also learned that it came from Scrooge. For a while, Donald believed he would keep the three thousand dollars but the company that manufactured the ping-pong balls collected the money as payment for them and the collector told them that the company belongs to Scrooge.</span>
</li><li> In another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks">Carl Barks</a> story, Scrooge had a pocket watch that happened to be a family heirloom. When one of his relatives died, he was required to present the pocket watch when claiming the inheritance. Scrooge then took it to Gyro Gearloose for repairs (The terms of the will also stated that the pocket watch must be working perfectly when presented to the executors of the will). Gyro noticed that a small stone that used to be encrusted to the watch seemed to be missing but it didn't worry Scrooge, who was used to the empty spot. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The inheritance consisted solely of the stone</span>.
</li><li> An Italian Donald Duck story revolves around Donald Duck, Fethry Duck, and Gladstone Gander receiving an inheritance from a distant uncle, who has a secret condition for who will be given his estate, which will be revealed after spending the night in his old castle. Donald and Fethry agree to team up and share the estate to try and offset Gladstone's infuriating luck. After several misadventures during the night, the executor of the will reveals that the uncle wanted his inheritor to be like him; lazy and plagued with bad luck. Donald has bad luck but works hard. Gladstone is lazy but is extremely lucky. So, the inheritance goes to Fethry, who is both lazy and has bad luck. Unfortunately for Fethry and Donald, the estate consists mostly of a massive debt, which won't be covered by selling off its assets, meaning that Gladstone's luck saved him by having him lose the inheritance.
</li><li> In <em>Die 13 Trilliarden Erbschaft</em>, Scrooge has been missing for so long he's been declared dead. As soon as Donald and Gladstone are informed Scrooge left his fortune to them, they hurry to spend it without listening to the rest of the will. Huey, Dewey, and Louie read it and find out Scrooge, not wanting his nephews to squander his fortune, set a condition preventing them from inheriting his estate until they add one million dollars to it. By the time Donald and Gladstone are informed of that condition, they've already spent nearly that amount. Gladstone <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">decides to earn that money by selling lottery tickets, offering Scrooge's fortune as the first prize and buying a ticket so he can win. He does win but Scrooge turns out to be alive and is upset that the extra money caused the money bin to collapse. He's entertaining the idea of changing the will to include Huey, Dewey, and Louie as beneficiaries.</span>

He then decided to marry Tooga (Thuga), since the other options were not so attractive. When he was about to get married, the will's executors showed up to tell him that they found out his uncle had secretly got married and left a widow and three kids. Pitheco would only inherit twenty bucks, provided he still gets married. Pitheco promptly declared he'd never change his life for so little. Hurt by this, Tooga hit him and left in tears. The executors then gave Pitheco a letter where his uncle told him he made that will hoping Pitheco would get married and enjoy the life of a family man. Pitheco then commented that now he knew the biggest prize he lost.

The alumnus was never able to beat the team during his time, and he wanted to 'inspire a victory'. The executor of the will, his granddaughter, even remarked on how stupid the whole thing was, but there you were. While the boys' team loses to Central, Betty points out that the will doesn't say <em>which</em> team needs to beat Central, and Riverdale gets its money when the girls' team wins.

However, since Pierce only has six friends, that leaves an empty seat for his late father's personal assistant, Gilbert Lawson, to sneak into the game with the intent of stealing the inheritance (because he was secretly Pierce's illegitimate, mixed-race, half-brother). Unfortunately for Gilbert, their father anticipated this turn of events and prepared an additional clause just for him, requiring that he signs a document agreeing not to reveal he's Cornelius Hawthorne's son.

The caveat: it's haunted. The gang manages to solve the case - as you'd expect, the lawyers got creative with - and Scooby wins by default... except it's all Confederate bills (once backed by a government but now that government <em>doesn't exist</em>).

Shaggy decides he's had enough ghost hunting for one lifetime and hires some ghostbusters <em>only to find out they're also ghosts</em>.

<ul><li> A rich Toronto lawyer, financier and practical joker named Charles Vance Millar, wrote in his will that he wanted the bulk of his estate to be given to the Toronto woman who birthed the most legitimate children in the 10 years after his death. The money he left was well invested and grew significantly over the ten years. During the same time, the Great Depression hit, which made a lot of people more desperate for money. This sparked the Great Stork Derby that went the full length of time with 4 winners and two runners-up despite frantic efforts to kill the will in the courts.
<ul><li> That's not the end of it: he also bequeathed joint possession of his summer cottage to three men who loathed each other and a very profitable Catholic distillery to several (Protestant) prominent temperance advocates in the Orange Order (on the condition that they take active part in running the brewery).
</li></ul></li><li> The Rule Against Perpetuities exists in the UK, the US, and other countries that inherited the Common Law. In its most common form, it simply states "No conditional bequest is valid unless it must vest, if at all, within a life in being plus 21 years." It works to prevent somebody from controlling their assets from beyond the grave forever (i.e. "in perpetuity"). Certain relevant reasonable-but-ridiculous legal illustrations showing why you don't want to be in arms reach include:
<ul><li> The "fertile octogenarian". The will leaves land to person A, aged 85, for her life, then to the first of her natural-born children to reach age 25. Since <em>theoretically</em> she could have a new child at 86<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note27gfn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note27gfn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note27gfn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">this pre-dated the law treating adopted children as legally equivalent to biological children</span>, have her other children die at 87, then die herself at 88, it is possible for the second part to be unfulfilled for 21 years after all the relevant people died. Thus, the second part is completely invalid, and the old lady inherits the land absolutely (it's up to her what happens to it after her death).
</li><li> The "unborn widow". The will leaves the property to person A for life, then their widow for life, and then any of their children still living at the time of the widow's death. If person A marries a person born after the will was executed, and the widow lives more than 21 years after person A dies, then the last condition would not activate within 21 years after person A dies; thus, the last condition is rendered invalid. Alternately, A might not be married when he dies, in which case there is no person who could become his widow, or A might divorce and remarry, in which case the widow at the time the will activates is not the widow referred to by the person who wrote the original will. The will might not prescribe A's children <em>still living</em> and instead simply refer to A's children, in which case it would refer to those children alive at the time of the will's activation and still be valid.
</li><li> Some jurisdictions specify that if a deceased person is named as the heir, and the will does not contain a legitimate second-to-die clause, the named heir's children stand to inherit that property. So, if A had three children, and one of those children died before A, leaving two children of his own, A's two surviving children would each get 1/3 of the estate, while the two grandchildren by the deceased sibling would each get 1/6.
</li><li> Many U.S. jurisdictions now take a "wait and see" approach; if the will vests or fails within 90 years of the descendant's death, it's valid, even if a circumstance <em>could</em> have arisen (but didn't) that would have made the waiting period longer. Incidentally, the Rule Against Perpetuities applies not only to bequeathments in wills but also to property placed into a Trust (including a trust created while the Grantor was still alive).
</li><li> There is a case in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/California" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/California">California</a> involving legal malpractice due to a lawyer's failure to apprehend the rule against perpetuities. The California high court ruled that "no reasonable lawyer" can understand the rule. To prove the complexity and often inanity of the rule, the above description isn't entirely correct.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> in the USA with regards to religion. Courts in Oregon (National Bank of Portland v. Snodgrass) and Illinois (Feinberg v. Feinberg) upheld heirs being stripped of their inheritances for marrying outside their religions or, in the case of the former, marrying a Catholic.
</li><li> This trope is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> for heirs of a certain age. Some will not allow a teen or person in their 20s to inherit money on the grounds that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolAndHisNewMoneyAreSoonParted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolAndHisNewMoneyAreSoonParted">they will spend it all quickly and/or foolishly</a>. It is legal to bar an heir from inheriting until they reach a certain age where they are (hopefully) wise enough to manage money.
