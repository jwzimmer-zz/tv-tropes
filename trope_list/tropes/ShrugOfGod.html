</p><p>Congratulations. Instead of an answer, you just got the Shrug of God: author(s) intentionally not answering a question about their work.
</p><p>Before you get angry at them for being evasive, remember that they may have a reason for their ambiguity.
</p><ul><li> <strong>They're saving it for the future.</strong> Maybe the creators plan to address the point in an upcoming installment/spin-off/revival/etc., or at least want to retain the option to do so. If so, they won't want to give the answer away yet. Alternatively, they may wish to stop <em>other</em> people from writing about it, such as when they try to enforce a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanworkBan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanworkBan">Fanwork Ban</a> by not handing people information which would be more useful to fanfic authors than to anyone else.
</li><li> <strong>It's better left ambiguous.</strong> Maybe the plot point in question was <em>supposed</em> to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding">ambiguous</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">senseless</a>. Creators may think that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">it's funnier</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">that way</a>, or that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfScary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfScary">it's scarier</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier">that way</a>, or that ambiguity feels realistic (because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> isn't perfectly neat with no mysteries). They may think that overanalysing things detracts from them, disliking meticulous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank">Fan Wank</a> and its older brother, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotDidactic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotDidactic">overzealous, full-time, academic literary analysis</a>. Some creators may enjoy leaving ambiguity intact because they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeasingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeasingCreator">just like</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">watching their fans squirm.</a>

Even if the answer <em>isn't</em> out there, creators may still want the fans to come up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">their</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsJesusInPurgatory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsJesusInPurgatory">own</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">answers</a>. (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWalrusWasPaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWalrusWasPaul">Sheesh</a>.</em>) Some may firmly believe in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor">Death of the Author</a> theory and not feel their interpretations are any more valid than anyone else's.
</li><li> <strong>Shrugging is safer.</strong> Maybe the possible answers to the question are sufficiently controversial that coming down on either side will provoke a backlash. The plot point may have sparked enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar">debate</a> in the fandom that <em>any</em> answer will cause a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a>, or the issue may be particularly heated due to having religious, political, or otherwise controversial implications that the authors would really rather avoid (such as "Does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> actually exist in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink">this setting</a>?"). Fending off attacks by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxHorrific" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxHorrific">worse</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping">shippers</a>) may require a shrug when the question is (and it <em>frequently</em> is), "So what were Alice and Bob <em>really</em> doing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">while off-camera</a> after that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UST">UST-filled</a> scene?" A truthful answer to such a question would result in people screaming for the creator's head on a chopping block no matter what the truth is because there are two sides of the issue<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note099a3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note099a3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note099a3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For example, in the case of the "What were Alice and Bob really doing?" question, if the answer is "Yes, they were having sex" then that would get people complaining about the show/movie being inappropriate but if the answer is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentInnuendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentInnuendo">No, they weren't having sex, it was just made suggestive as a joke</a>", then people who ship Alice and Bob might get mad at the writers for not making their favourite ship canon.</span>. Sometimes, it's the entire work that is tricky, with creators <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">wishing that they never wrote it</a> and are trying to just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">pretend it never happened</a>.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> <strong>They don't know.</strong> The creators shrug because they genuinely don't have an answer to the question. For example, they might honestly not remember what they were thinking when they wrote that particular bit, or they might be just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants">making it up as they go</a>, and have no more idea what's going on than any of the viewers. Sometimes, the question is about some detail completely tangential to the story which the author(s) never considered. Although it might be cool if the author would just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">make up answers on the spot</a> to questions about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">supporting character #23's</a> favorite pizza topping, you can hardly blame the author who doesn't.
</li></ul><p>Not to be confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlipFlopOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlipFlopOfGod">Flip-Flop of God</a>, where the author has a definite answer which has <em>changed</em> over time, or with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsApathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsApathy">Creator's Apathy</a>, which is when a creator admits to not caring about or trying on their project.
</p><p>Contrast with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a>, and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">A Wizard Did It</a>", which are given in response to questions about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole">Plot Holes</a> or the workings of a story's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum">Phlebotinum</a>. In contrast, the Shrug of God is given in response to more mundane questions: questions that should have a simple, straightforward answer. Don't mistake it for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon">Ascended Fanon</a> which, while it may come with a shrug from the creator, is quite different: Ascended Fanon is when the creator accepts, for any reason, the explanations offered by fandom to questions raised by that author's work. The shrug comes when the author refuses to take a stand about either those questions or any possible answer to them.
</p><p>In other words, if the question is "How does this work?" and the answer is "Beats me," then it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a>. If the question is "What happened?" and the answer is "Beats me", it's the Shrug of God. If the answer is "Magic" then changed later on to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdScience">Science</a>", it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlipFlopOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlipFlopOfGod">Flip-Flop of God</a>.
</p><p>When the author insists on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot">quashing</a> a theory, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed">Jossed</a>, which is the opposite. When the author explains but in supplementary material see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>. For those stories that are deliberately ambiguous, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding">No Ending</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges">Riddle for the Ages</a>.
</p><p>In lieu of a definitive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, someone connected to the production may chime in with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul">Word of Saint Paul</a>, or anyone with sufficient credibility may offer up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante">Word of Dante</a>.

<ul><li> Also, Himaruya tends to avoid directly answering questions as to whether or not Germany is really the Holy Roman Empire.
</li></ul></li><li> When asked if the ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> was meant to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter">happy</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">sad</a>, director and co-creator Goro Taniguchi's response was "Decide for yourself." Though rather than a shrug, this may simply be him acknowledging that everyone has a different opinion and not trying to force his beliefs upon the fanbase.
<ul><li> In regards to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lelouch's apparent death at the end</span>, however, this trope was averted; in several post-series interviews, other staff members have indicated that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's really dead</span>. Still, during the broadcast the official website had claimed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nunnally died during the Tokyo disaster in order to keep her eventual return surprising</span> and Sunrise itself has <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sankakucomplex.com/wp-content/gallery/misc-images-xiii/img_1032045_22102323_0.jpg">shown<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> that they might well prefer to tease fans like us and let everyone duke it out...at least until a sequel is made and the question is finally answered once and for all.
<ul><li> Even after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the announcement of said sequel</span>, it's still possible that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lelouch was originally meant to stay dead until they finally decided to retcon it</span>.
</li><li> The exact phrasing was something along the lines of "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> [His (Lelouch's) death] was the price he had to pay for a peaceful world.</span>" And, depending on your interpretation, <em>that</em> can still be taken to mean anything.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> When asked if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Spike</span> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em> actually died, Shinichiro Watanabe said he didn't know and jokingly said there could be a sequel. It's anyone's guess whether it's for the fourth, fifth, or both reasons.
<ul><li> By contrast, Watanabe has also answered questions asked by those who seemed to assume <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Spike</span> must be dead with something to the effect of "Did you see him die? I didn't, he seemed like he was seriously lacking some sleep."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlipFlopOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlipFlopOfGod">More recently</a> however, in an interview he did shortly before the premier of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceDandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceDandy">Space Dandy</a></em> he instead said <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he survived.</span>

(i.e. whether he viewed them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiGuys">a couple</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Heterosexual Life-Partners</a>, or something else). Because the interview took place many years after he accepted the role, and because he had not known much about either one of the two characters, he simply stated that he did not know enough about them to comment on their relationship, and did not want to offend fans (shippers of this couple and otherwise.)

His film, <em>The End of Evangelion</em>, doesn't exactly help matters either.
<ul><li> The mantra "I don't know. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank">Fan Wank</a> something" (formerly pictured above) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">tends to pop up</a> along with a picture of Anno, whenever the fandom discuss the more ambiguous parts of the series.
</li></ul></li><li> The makers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir">Noir</a></em> keep very quiet about what the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">two gunshots</span> at the end mean, so the fans are still in the dark about the important question whether <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the main characters live or not</span>.
</li><li> Eiichiro Oda, creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, usually answers <em>everything</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">straight</a>, except for a few things; as open as he is, even he has dodged the occasional question, such as what Shanks and Gold Roger's bounties are, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateShowdownOfUltimateDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateShowdownOfUltimateDestiny">who would win in a fight between Zoro and Sanji</a>.
<ul><li> He's also not very good about indicating how much time has passed (it gives the story a mythical quality). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/HomePage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/HomePage">but it's been known to bug some people.</a>
</li><li> He's also known for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">making up answers on the spot</a>, just so he can have an answer. When asked how Zoro can talk even when holding a sword in his mouth, Oda's response was "His heart allows him to speak".

It's completely unknown if she lives by herself or not.
<ul><li> He also left the design of the witches to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerangedAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerangedAnimation">Gekidan InuCurry</a>, meaning that he's probably not the person to ask if you wanted to know <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> what sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girls</a> they were</span>.

<ul><li> In another interview, he has stated he has no idea where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the wings</span> came from, being added by the aforementioned InuCurry. He then said in that same interview that additions from the animation staff <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">made it easier for him to write future stories</a>, suggesting that an answer may be coming.

<ul><li> In fan circles, a "pregnant Ranma" is something that is better left unanswered. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> once had an article on the phrase, but it's no longer up.

<ul><li> Yes it was. Cerebus: "Cerebus just has to remember where he hid it or nobody's going to be reading the New Booke of Cerebus." Dave: "Until two thousand years from now when this part of the Sanctuary is torn down to make room for a shopping mall." The consequences may be ambiguous, but it will be found, and it will be read.

<ul><li> For the most part, at least - Don Rosa introduced both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a>'s mother and sister and Scrooge's parents, and Scrooge has two sisters, a brother and a half-brother making regular appearances. His mother got around.
<ul><li> It should be noted that the said brother and half-brother don't exist in the same continuity as the two sisters. There are different interpretations in the absence of actual canonicity, even by the current writers.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke">The Killing Joke</a></em>, a backstory is told which initially appears to be definitive, but the Joker later says, "Something like that happened to me.

If I'm going to have a past, I'd rather it be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast">multiple choice</a>."

This is an irritating example, because the script for the issue does directly say that he was being raped. (This may have something to do with the female cohort in question, Tarantula, being suspected by many of being her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a>.)

I have my own idea, but after all, this is a Disney comic!"
</li><li> Tom Brevoort has been mum about the plot inconsistencies regarding Mockingbird's return from "the dead" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion">Secret Invasion</a></em>. <em>Invasion</em> established that Mockingbird had never really died in the first place, despite the fact that there were at least one or two previous stories that showed her in the afterlife. Brevoort's stance was that so few people remembered those stories to begin with, that it really wasn't worth the effort to try and reconcile the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole">Plot Holes</a>.
<ul><li> Jim McCann's <em>New Avengers: The Reunion</em> and <em>Hawkeye &amp; Mockingbird</em> partially answered this — the Skrull posing as Mockingbird honestly had no idea that she wasn't Mockingbird, and went as far as to die for the people she cared about, making it not too much of a stretch that the Skrull kept Mockingbird's appearance in the afterlife.

He refused to confirm various future <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUntwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUntwist">untwists</a>, one of which was confirmed in a reference book before it got anywhere close to being confirmed in the comic itself. And when asked about "the Rohlan/Demagol thing", namely the theory that "Rohlan" has been Demagol in disguise since issue 14, he said <a class="urllink" href="https://boards.theforce.net/threads/knights-of-the-old-republic-32-vindication-part-1-of-4.28441914/page-3#post-28459840">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>:

Either choice completely changes both the ending and how Prowl is perceived as a character. Later, Mike Costa would reveal the answer in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersIDW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersIDW">Transformers</a></em> ongoing: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Prowl did <em>not</em> destroy the slug.</span>

<ul><li> What is Hobbes' true nature? A magical stuffed animal that comes to life when Calvin is around? A figment of Calvin's imagination? Bill Watterson isn't sure himself.
<ul><li> In the Tenth Anniversary Collection, Watterson would only state that Hobbes is a comment on the subjective nature of reality; Calvin sees him differently from everyone else.
</li><li> This is reportedly the reason Watterson would not allow a stuffed toy Hobbes to be manufactured (that, and his loathing of merchandising). He felt it would answer the question as to whether or not Hobbes was just a stuffed toy.
</li><li> Other interviewers have occasionally tried to trap Watterson with a gotcha question highlighting specific instances in the strip in which Hobbes does seem to be a) either completely real or b) either completely imaginary. For example one interview where the interviewer asks how Hobbes could tie Calvin to a chair and then be discovered in that state by his father, who is not ordinarily able to see evidence of Hobbes being "alive." Watterson simply answered ambiguously that he liked the intellectual tension created by "two versions of reality that do not mix."
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em>Tenth Anniversary Collection</em>, Watterson states that "<em>Hamster Huey and the Gooey Kablooie</em> (like the '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Noodle Incident</a>' I've referred to in several strips) is left to the reader's imagination, where it's sure to be more outrageous."

<ul><li> He did give an answer to that question. The Crocodiles are speaking "Crocese".
<ul><li> Kind of undermined by the comic itself, where it is pretty much established that, of all the Crocs we meet, it is only Larry, Bob and a few others who speak like that. Larrys wife, son and parents all speak english without any visible accent.

And stated that the elements that the elements that could be applied to God could just be wishful thinking and unlikely coincidences, if the reader chooses to interpret them as such.
<ul><li> In his postscript for a much smaller fic, <em>See You Later</em>, (which is told entirely through dialogue), he noted that it's up to the reader to decide if Stephanie's words to Tim were genuine hope or denial in the face of despair. It's also not evident or clarified which one said "I love you" first.

Robert puzzles over it for a bit and then admits that he doesn't know what it means either.

Bringing it up to them, famously, will usually put them in fits of stifled laughter.
</li><li> In response to questions of whether or not the Human Project really existed and if they were able to create a cure to the mass infertility after the ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChildrenOfMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChildrenOfMen">Children of Men</a></em>, the staff merely responded that the answer depended wholly on where you lie on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism">Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism</a>.
</li><li> The Joker in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em> tells two entirely different stories as to how he got those scars (and started to tell a third), all of which are probably lies. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherNolan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherNolan">Christopher Nolan</a> not only didn't comment on them, he said Joker has <em>no backstory at all</em>. This is in keeping with the comics.
</li><li> <strong>Anything</strong> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLynch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLynch">David Lynch</a>. Lynch is so adamant about leaving his work open to interpretation that he won't even explain it to his actors. So, don't bother asking them, either. Although, Naomi Watts did give an insightful comment regarding <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MulhollandDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MulhollandDrive">Mulholland Dr.</a></em>: something to the effect that when a person is dreaming, they create every person, event, and object in that dream. While Lynch may have very specific meanings in mind about certain things he puts into his films, he has also admitted that sometimes images just strike his fancy, and he puts them into his films without trying to assign any meaning to them.
</li><li> There have been several contradicting opinions by the actors and other people involved in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDayTheEarthStoodStill1951" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDayTheEarthStoodStill1951">The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)</a></em> as to a complete translation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlaatuBaradaNikto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlaatuBaradaNikto">Klaatu Barada Nikto</a>, the phrase used to stop Gort's rampage. Klaatu, obviously, is the protagonist of the movie, and one can assume the other two words are something important in his language. Robert Wise, the film's director, related a story he had with Edmund North, the screenplay writer, saying North told him, "Well, it's just something I kind of cooked up. I thought it sounded good."
</li><li> Produced David Heyman admits that none of the creative team on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</a> </em> have any idea what happened to the real <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Percival Graves</span> but have acknowledged that he did exist.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GroundhogDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GroundhogDay">Groundhog Day</a></em>: How long was Phil Connors trapped in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">"Groundhog Day" Loop</a>? It depends on who you ask. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillMurray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillMurray">Bill Murray</a> guesses 10 years (widely thought to be the "correct" answer), while writer/director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HaroldRamis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HaroldRamis">Harold Ramis</a> guessed <em>10,000</em> years.

</li><li> Invoked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood">Clint Eastwood</a>. He had always intended that the mysterious stranger in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighPlainsDrifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighPlainsDrifter">High Plains Drifter</a></em> was the murdered sheriff's brother, but he liked the fan theories about who or what he was so much that he went on to make <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PaleRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PaleRider">Pale Rider</a></em> and deliberately avoid any clues as to the preacher's true identity.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherNolan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherNolan">Christopher Nolan</a> hasn't had much to say about various interpretations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Inception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Inception">Inception</a></em> since its release, but costume designer Jeffrey Kurland and actor Dileep Rao (Yusuf) have both weighed in on their views of the ending. Nolan has since said that he personally sees the ending as being real but he doesn't want his interpretation to change anyone else's. In fact, he's admitted that he's highly amused that people keep constantly asking him questions about the ending even though he has no real desire to answer them.
</li><li> The <em>entire plot</em> of the French film <em>La Moustache</em> is uncertain, according to the scriptwriter / director. Basically, the main question is whether the main character's reality keeps changing and he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory">the only one who remembers the way things used to be</a>, or whether <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroughTheEyesOfMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroughTheEyesOfMadness">he's simply insane</a>, with the second question being which scenes are "real" and which are hallucinations. The writer / director has admitted that he didn't even bother coming up with answers to any of that—he just had an idea and filmed it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulThomasAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulThomasAnderson">Paul Thomas Anderson</a> often responds with these when asked about the meaning of different things in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Magnolia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Magnolia">Magnolia</a></em>, claiming he doesn't remember what he was thinking at the time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheWachowskis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheWachowskis">The Wachowskis</a> have refused to discuss any of the more ambiguous moments of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMatrix">The Matrix</a></em> trilogy (like what's going on with Neo and the Matrix at the Ωend of the third film) because they prefer for the fans to make their own interpretations.
</li><li> In the ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Memento" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Memento">Memento</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Was Teddy lying? or telling the truth?</span>. Christopher Nolan has never said either way, and more confusingly, the DVD commentary for the movie actually has three endings, one that says one version is true, another that says another version is true, and a third that does not say either way.
</li><li> Between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMuppetsTakeManhattan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMuppetsTakeManhattan">The Muppets Take Manhattan</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMuppets">The Muppets</a></em> The Henson Company/Muppet Studios refused to comment about whether Kermit and Piggy were actually married at the end of <em>Manhattan</em>. The characters commented about it all the time; they just disagreed. However, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMuppets">The Muppets</a></em> strongly implies that the marriage did go through, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but they later split up</span>.
</li><li> The contents of the suitcase from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction">Pulp Fiction</a></em> are an example. It was originally supposed to be the diamonds from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReservoirDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReservoirDogs">Reservoir Dogs</a>, but then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/QuentinTarantino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/QuentinTarantino">Tarantino</a> changed his mind and said it's basically supposed to be "whatever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">seems most valuable to the viewer and can fit in a suitcase</a>." He's regretted putting the yellow glow in the briefcase, because it seems to be a clue to a question that never had an answer. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelLJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelLJackson">Samuel L. Jackson</a> and Tarantino both got sick of getting asked what was in the briefcase and would occasionally answer, "Batteries and light bulbs."

Fans have always asked director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicholasMeyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicholasMeyer">Nicholas Meyer</a> why, but Meyer's never given a answer, often saying "Why do <em>you</em> think he wears it?".

Nobody knows. How did Yoda end up as the Grandmaster of the Jedi Order? Nobody knows. Why is every known member of his species a Jedi? <em>Nobody knows</em>.
</li><li> In order to avoid having to tie the <em>Star Wars</em> universe into the real world, no one connected to the franchise has ever given a definitive answer on the human race's planet of origin. We know that humans are the most numerous species in the <em>Star Wars</em> galaxy, and it's been established that they aren't indigenous to most of the planets on which they're the primary species, but where they originally came from is anyone's guess.
<ul><li> Incidentally, some elements of the original trilogy's world-building (most notably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ecumenopolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ecumenopolis">Coruscant</a>) were inspired by Isaac Asimov's <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FoundationTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FoundationTrilogy">Foundation Trilogy</a>, where the question of humanity's planet of origin is a mystery in-universe and eventually becomes a plot point.

Carpenter once told a fan that she was supposed to use her imagination and decide an ending for herself. The fan griped, "Oh, I <em>hate</em> that."

Are the events in the movie all just part of Quaid's Ego Trip, or is it real? The director has stated that both interpretations of the film fit the facts, and refuses to say which is the truth.
</li><li> In the commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zardoz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zardoz">Zardoz</a></em>, John Boorman, who produced, directed and <strong>wrote</strong> this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> of a movie, admits he has no clue what's going on or what he was thinking (or most likely, ingesting) at different points.

Since he'd also happened to use a unisex name, he decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGender">keep it up through the whole book</a>, and now maintains that even he doesn't know whether Sam is a man, a woman, or intersex, and consequently whether his/her relationship with Archie is gay or straight. He even advises people to read through the book three times, imagining Sam as all three, to decide which works best for them.

When the book was being filmed, the director asked Chandler who killed Taylor; Chandler said that he didn't know either, so it was left unexplained in the movie as well. Legend suggests that the lack of a solution was an error on Chandler's part, which he acknowledged in during the above conversation. He just forgot to tie that detail up.

</li><li> One early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> book contains a statement by Terry Pratchett that there is no map of the Disc, because "you can't map a sense of humor." <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Discworld_Mapp">Then he made one anyway.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<ul><li> However, the map <em>was</em> supposedly written by the very CMOT Dibbler itself. That alone should raise questions of accuracy.
</li><li> And he's also said the Disc has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">alternate pasts</a>. God only knows which one the map is showing.
</li><li> In one of his forewords he said that the book contained no map but readers should feel free to draw one if they wanted to. A reader named Stephen Briggs took him at his word, which is how the various Discworld maps ended up being drawn. In the forewords to the maps Pratchett expresses surprise that places he made up for the sake of a joke and then forgot about fit together so neatly.
</li><li> It should also be mentioned that Pratchett did say continents are found and lost on even the best-run worlds, so it's possible that the Disc itself changes enough to make maps of it a futile measure at best. The country of Chimeria is shown on the map, despite the <em>Companion</em> stating that it's a "brigadoon", and has wandered off somewhere.
</li><li> On a related theme, Terry Pratchett is on record as having warned would-be researchers and PhD candidates in Literature<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2lsza');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2lsza" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2lsza');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">An accusation Terry particularly resented - he argued that he wanted people to read his books <em>for pleasure</em></span> that as he finishes every book, he wipes the computer files clean so that any first drafts, notes or interim drafts will never be available to base a thesis around. Whether <em>all</em> the files were wiped before his death, as he seemed to want, is yet to be seen. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RhiannaPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RhiannaPratchett">His daughter</a> is set against any continuation of the series as "the books are sacred to Dad", but it's still possible we may see "fragments" of novels and "outline plots" being published "as is", in a similar manner to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSalmonOfDoubt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSalmonOfDoubt">The Salmon of Doubt</a></em>.

His own ambiguities go untouched, with the footnote to <em>The Infinity Doctors</em> acknowledging that placing it where he does doesn't actually work, and the entries referring to a villainous contemporary of the Doctor's father named Marnel, whose son visited him on Earth in the seventies, pointedly not speculating on who said son might be (although he does place the visit in the UNIT era, immediately following a mention of the Master, without further comment).

</li><li> George R.R. Martin is very fond of doing this, either because he hasn't thought out the details of a particular question, or because it's related to future events in the series.

Pullman also has no answer as to why a few people in Lyra's world have daemons that are their own sex, or when exactly the daemon appears - during birth or after.
<ul><li> He also used this when someone asked if a same-sexed daemon meant the person was gay. He said he'd never thought of that and it was as good an explanation as any. He also said it could mean second sight or something.

When Carroll was asked why this was the case, he replied, "Why not?"
</li><li> In the prologue of Margaret Craven's <em>I Heard An Owl Call My Name</em>, a doctor explains to a bishop that a newly ordained priest is terminally ill: a few active years left, then a few as an invalid. The priest dies during the novel, in an accident. Craven has said she doesn't know what he had.

For example, the main character is named Else Tage. Is the final "e" in either or both names silent? His response was essentially that the reader had his blessing to pronounce all names any way that seemed to the reader to make sense.

However, when he is asked a question which he considers to be too spoilerific, he has developed a habit of saying "I'm not gonna tell you," in a singsong voice.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling">J. K.

Fortunately, no one did.
<ul><li> She also refused to reveal the identities of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couples</a> for years for fear of fan backlash (because Pottershipping is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a>).
</li><li> The Shrug has also been applied to the entire chapter "King's Cross", which, according to Jo, could be interpreted as reality or simply "Reality inside Harry's head" — but why on Earth should that mean it was not real?
</li><li> She never did say what that spell was that Dumbledore was trying to cast on Voldemort during their duel that made Voldy's eyes narrow suspiciously. And now we may very well never find out.
</li><li> She will also never reveal how far <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dumbledore and Grindewald's relationship went - were they ever an actual couple?</span> or what on Earth did Aberforth do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">with that goat</a>. She is waiting for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a> encyclopedia to reveal what exactly Voldemort did to get his rudimentary body before the beginning of <em>Goblet</em> (this because it horrified her editor when Jo told her).
</li></ul></li><li> This is the entire point of the story <em>The Lady or the Tiger?</em> by Frank Stockton, as well as its sequel, <em>The Discourager of Hesitancy</em>. Stockton was once at a party where, in an attempt to get a straight answer out of him, the host(s) served two kinds of ice cream: one in the shape of a lady, the other in the shape of a tiger. They asked which he would prefer. Stockton said, "I'll have a bit of both."

Often times this is used to avoid spoiling things that will be addressed in future books, however he has also said that sometimes he intends to leave the question open permanently to give fans something to discuss, since many of his ardent fans really love theorizing about things. Occasionally it's also just to cover things he doesn't actually know the answer to, either because he hasn't decided/figure it out yet or he simply can't remember the answer at the moment and doesn't want to get it wrong.

Because he uses a pseudonym (Lemony Snicket), he can pass it off as an excuse not to say anything about his work in public appearances, since Lemony's the one with the answers and he's just an "humble representative." Since the series ended with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot">Kudzu Plot</a>, many mysteries unsolved and loose ends, it's particularly jarring.

She will have a secret. Bad things will happen." Then there's her response when people ask about trivial things, usually the genders or pelt colors of cats who are only mentioned once in an offhand way. Often it's "I don't know, sorry."
</li><li> Robert Jordan, author of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">Wheel of Time</a></em> series, was famous for this before his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">untimely death</a>. Jordan had a term invented specifically for this use—whenever he was asked a question which he thought might be a spoiler, his response would be "RAFO" (Read And Find Out)). Most (in)famous was his long-running treatment of one of the biggest mysteries of the series (or, at least, biggest to the fans): Who killed Asmodean at the end of the fifth book? Every time Robert Jordan was asked, he refused to answer, assuring the readers that they should have figured it out already (although this is not clear at all). In the end, the true culprit was only <em>explicitly</em> revealed in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">glossary</a></em> of <em>Towers of Midnight</em>, the thirteenth book.

Chief among these are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the nature of Nakomi, and what exactly happened with Rand's pipe</span>. Similarly, Team Jordan has confirmed that they will never elaborate on the fates of any surviving character after the final page.

Michael Straczynski</a>, who was among the first TV show producers to consistently interact with fans and answer any of their questions, with the exception of things that would spoil future plot points; on some occasions, he even flat-out lied to avoid spoilers. This was made possible due to his having planned out in advance not only the entire five year run of the series, but the thousand years before and after that period. However, there are still some plot points he refuses to explain, in case he gets a chance to use them in a spin-off. A case in point is Delenn's toast to the disgraced Lennier in the series finale among toasts to the dead; all we get on the commentary is "That's a very sad story, and maybe I'll tell it someday."

The few times he did address it, his answer was vague and contradictory. This went on for over a decade. Eventually, with the unfortunate death of Michael O'Hare, JMS finally gave the real reason. O'Hare suffered from schizophrenia, and it got worse while filming Season 1, forcing him to quit. When they met again for the Season 3 episode he guest starred in, JMS said that he would take the secret to his grave. O'Hare responded, "No, take it to my grave," feeling that the fans were owed an answer.

Adama's knowledge or lack thereof is a pretty significant part of the relationship between the two characters, yet Ronald D. Moore has never given an answer on whether the scene should be considered to have actually "happened". Another scene even seems to imply that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Cylon "god" is a rogue Lord of Kobol or Lucifer figure in some capacity</span>, which would have massive implications for some of the more out-there moments in the series, but again, Moore just shrugs.
<ul><li> Then again, this has been Moore's general response to just about every extra-canonical theory thrown his way with the lone exception of the "Starbuck's dad is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost">Daniel/Number Seven</a>" theory. That's the only thing he's come out an acknowledged was an outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a> because the writers had fraked up the Cylon model numbering system and needed to explain their way out of the logic trap.

It's apparently a generic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a>, no strings attached. Director's commentary is "It was in, it was out, it was in, it was out."
<ul><li> Ironically, it turned out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies">Russell T Davies</a> who picked up on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a> for "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E17E18TheEndOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E17E18TheEndOfTime">The End of Time</a>" (<em>The Writer's Tale: The Final Chapter</em> makes it clear there was no long-term plan involved).
</li><li> Davies also gave a Shrug Of God when asked whether Davros had survived the ending of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E13JourneysEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E13JourneysEnd">Journeys' End</a>". In that case it was Moffat who eventually, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity">and predictably</a>, answered "yes".
</li><li> When asked whether the Eighth Doctor's revelation that he's half-human on his mother's side is still valid, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a> gave a response to the effect of, "Well, he certainly said that, didn't he?" And as Moffat's characters often say, "Rule one: The Doctor lies."
<ul><li> Moffat also openly endorses lying to the fans if it helps to keep the mystery of the story. A good percentage of questions levelled at him will be met with vague answers for a variety of reasons. Just the only reason you <em>can't</em> give for this is that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants">making it up as he goes</a>.

One shrug that inspired particular fan rage was when they were asked <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">how Nathan Petrelli <em>came back to life</em> after being pronounced dead in the Season 3 premiere</span>, and the answer was, "He just got lucky.

</li><li> "The Venus Butterfly" was a sex trick mentioned in the 1986 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LALaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LALaw">L.A. Law</a></em> episode of the same name. The show received many letters and phone calls from viewers asking what it was, as well as two requests to license the term. Members of the cast claim that <em>to this day</em>, viewers still ask them about it. The episode's writer, Terry Louise Fisher, stated that she had just made it up. Still, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a> has led to several therapists (and even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Playboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Playboy">Playboy</a></em> magazine) thinking up their own versions of it, the most accepted one offered by writer and sex educator Sue Johanson in 2005.

The response: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon">"Consider it canonical."</a>
<ul><li> Rogers also frequently answers questions relating to the characters personal lives with "whatever makes the story more interesting to you".

</li><li> Cuse and Lindelof of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> did this a lot in response to fan questions, but it came in distinct flavors. Sometimes they had no answer because the question was about something they didn't consider interesting or important. Some they have mentioned in podcasts include how Kelvin got to the island and what happened to Sun's dog. At other times, they'll read the fan question, but avoid answering it, then comment on how they dodged the question, which usually implied any answer would spoil an upcoming development. Well after the show ended, it also became clear that they sometimes dodged or gave noncommittal answers because their advance planning of the plot was not as detailed as they preferred fans to think it was.
</li><li> Two pricing games on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight">The Price Is Right</a></em> (Check Game and Credit Card) have been "withdrawn". Although neither game has been played in years, the staff has not officially declared either game retired  but then again, they're also making no claims of either game coming back. So as far as they're concerned, both games may or may not be retired. Check Game returned in 2013.
</li><li> Early in the run of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em>, it was said that Rimmer's parents belonged to a religion called the Seventh Day Advent Hoppists, but in a 2012 episode Rimmer claimed that his parents were members of the Church of Judas. When questioned on it by fans, series co-creator (and by this point, sole writer) Doug Naylor simply replied that he'd forgotten about the earlier reference to the Rimmer family's religion, and that he didn't consider such continuity matters to be a big deal. For his part, the series' script editor, Andrew Ellard suggested that the Rimmer family probably changed their religion constantly in an attempt to somehow get ahead in life (or just find more people to sleep with, in the case of Rimmer's mother).
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Reunion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Reunion">Reunion</a></em> was planned such that each episode would take place in one year in the lives of six friends, covering the span from their high school graduation to their 20-year reunion. Tying the series together was the mystery of the murder of one of the friends. Unfortunately (at least for the show's few fans), it was cancelled with only nine episodes having been aired. When the show's creators were pressed in interviews for details on how the show would have played out, they admitted that they hadn't decided who the murderer was.

When asked by his fellow crewmates to explain how Klingons from different time frames could possibly look so different, even floating numerous explanations popular in fanon for decades, Worf merely replies "We do not discuss it with outsiders". The Deep Space Nine writers stated that they had no intention of canonising an answer because all the options sounded trite to them when everyone knew it was just down to budget and costume developments and felt a comedic acknowledgement that left fans to speculate freely would be more fun for the fandom. Years, later the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> writers decided to canonise the plot ideas the Deep Space Nine staff had dismissed.

Similarly, she doesn't offer an explanation of what it was that Billie Joe and the narrator (who's singing the song) threw off the bridge into the river, which is implied to have something to do with the suicide. Gentry explained that her focus was on the family's rather callous reaction to the news of Billie Joe's death, not why he jumped off, so she didn't bother to devise a deep meaning (though a film adaptation of the song did provide some answers: Billie Joe and the narrator threw an old doll of hers off the bridge, and he killed himself because he had a sexual encounter with a man and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gayngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gayngst">couldn't handle it</a>).

Mike Majewski's usual response to the question has generally been something along the lines of "I don't even remember" or "it doesn't mean anything", but more sarcastic answers have been given, namely "one dollar, three tacos, eight hours on the shitter".

For example, it's mentioned that miss Gard <em>probably</em> has some kind of catch that needs to be fulfilled in order to use healing magic, but both Billy and Harry are left scratching their heads as to what that catch might be.

The answer is deliberately left out, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">DMs</a> can provide their own and easily work those events into their own plotline.

A straight answer has never been given, other than a novel hinting that she has ties to the Greek pantheon of gods. The most direct answer simply states that she was inspired by the title character of Algernon Swinburne's poem "Dolores".
<ul><li> Incidentally, unlike the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em> scenario, which it's stated explicitly that it is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">DMs</a> call to provide an explanation for the various mysteries, <em>Planescape</em> encouraged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">DMs</a> to leave such questions regarding the Lady of Pain and various other multiversal engimas deliberately unanswered, to maintain the setting's particular ethos.

<ul><li> While some fans reject the 3rd edition <em>Ravenloft</em> products, they did provide a satisfactory answer: the Dark Powers have no canonical true nature, and DMs should do whatever they want with no worries.

<ul><li> One noted example in the <em>New Orleans: City of the Damned</em> supplement is that Donovan, the Prince's Sheriff, is concealing his identity and that it would be disastrous if his true identity were made known.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EverQuestII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EverQuestII">EverQuest II</a></em> developers are infamous for doing this. So much so, that <em>not</em> giving a straight answer one way or another has frustrated many a customer into cancelling their accounts because of the sheer unpredictability of where the game was heading in terms of both story and gameplay mechanics.

Every interview they have will always have at least one question with an ambiguous answer that's as vague as possible. <strong>Always</strong>. It's not so bad to want your MMO to have some mysteries, but trying to have your game as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> as possible with things that hundreds of thousands of players haven't figured out for 4+ years is something else entirely.

To this day, nobody knows what the developers were trying to convey.

</li></ul></li><li> When asked what the pop condition was for Almighty Apkallu (a monster who has only ever been seen a handful of times) they initially shrugged saying that they didn't remember that monster. Later they responded with the vague hints of "First of all, luck plays a big role in whether he appears or not" and "He doesn't like being left alone, and will wander off if no one is around to keep him company."

Nintendo's American <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">Bowdlerization Policy</a> didn't like the idea of the player beating up women, so in the early Americanised games, they were made Trans Women, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">(because beating THEM up is SOOOO much better)</a>. In later Japanese game appearances she was referred to in manuals and other written materials as "newhalf", a derogatory Japanese term for trans women. Capcom has conceded officially on both sides of the Pacific that she IS trans, but refuse to confirm her operative status if any.

In the interview, he stated that he feels that the fans should find out how the story plays out themselves. Regardless, he acknowledged the constant effort and near match that Mat-Pat (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/GameTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/GameTheory">Game Theory</a>) made and revealed some plot points and interesting facts.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreeSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreeSpace">FreeSpace</a></em> series was never completed, and Volition have said perhaps two things about the story and where it was going to go, which actually raised more questions than they answered. Cue the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">Epileptic Trees</a>.
<ul><li> In a much-anticipated 2011 interview with the fanbase (more than 10 years after the last game was released), lead writer Jason Scott did reveal a few details about what was planned for the future games. However, he did so in such a vague manner that he simply fueled further speculation.

The screen fades to the credits-on-black but Maria keeps on talking, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a single gunshot is heard, and she quits talking</span>. Rockstar's official response to fan questions about what actually happened is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"certainly gun shots were fired but nobody is sure as to exactly what happened."</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em>'s writer, Marc Laidlaw, remains very careful not to make any crucial statements about some of the fuzzier parts of the series' continuity.

Still, the writer Chris Avellone's response to a question on this was "Can't comment, but good catch. Sorry."
<ul><li> Anyone that's read MCAs <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> Bibles would recognize "good catch" as his standard response to a coincidence or minor detail pointed out by a fan that he actually likes the implications of.
</li></ul></li><li> For several years, fans have always asked Valve how the entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a> started for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em> series, but an answer has yet to be produced since Valve wants fans to come up with their own theories instead of always being spoon fed information. A supplementary comic that was released some time after the game launched showed that the virus began as some form of super rabies that quickly spread throughout the country, but <em>how</em> it came to be has yet to be answered.
<ul><li> Fans are also demanding to know what happens to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2">Left 4 Dead 2</a> survivors after they are saved by the military at the end of The Parish campaign since the military was killing carriers of the virus and it was confirmed that the survivors are also carriers. Valve has yet to say anything on the subject.
</li></ul></li><li> A year after the release of the game, Nintendo finally answered on where in the <em>Zelda</em> timeline that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em> takes place. The answer? It's the last game. The japanese Zelda website even places the game in all three timelines as the last entry in the history. The dev team also stated that it's up to the players to decide where <em>Breath of the Wild</em> fits in the timeline.
</li><li> What is The Secret of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland">Monkey Island</a>©? answer: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Look behind you, a three-headed monkey!"</span>
<ul><li> "Only LeChuck knows. And he's an evil insane nightmarish murderous revenge-obsessed undead horror, so good luck getting an honest answer out of <em>him</em>."
</li><li> This one was given a canonical answer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeFromMonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeFromMonkeyIsland">Escape from Monkey Island</a></em>, which established that the island contains <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a giant robot monkey,</span> but this sequel was created by a different production team to the one that set the question. Original creator Ron Gilbert has his own answer, but remains disinclined to tell anyone.
</li><li> Probably the intended original answer was that Monkey Island contains a portal to the underworld (under a giant monkey head), which Guybrush discovers near the end, and is pretty staggering as secrets go. It just wasn't positively identified as such in-game.
</li></ul></li><li> Mortis Ghost, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OFF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OFF">OFF</a></em>'s creator, prefers to let everyone come up with their own explanations to whatever just happened in the game rather than say so himself. Considering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">what sort of game we're talking about</a>, that's a lot of speculation to be done.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MoshiMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MoshiMonsters">Moshi Monsters</a></em>:
<ul><li> When contacted about where Furbert Snufflepeeps (a disappeared scientist) went, the creators basically said they didn't know.
</li><li> When players asked Roary Scrawl, a character, the question of how Gingersnap the cat got his scar, he replied in his answer in the official magazine that nobody knows but he personally thinks he got it in a scuffle over melted cheese.
</li></ul></li><li> What exactly is a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a> Master"? According to the Pokémon Company, "It is the intent of the Pokémon creators that such questions be left to the imaginations and interpretations of Pokémon fans, adding more excitement and mystery to the Pokémon universe."
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory">Rune Factory</a></em> game's ending is the best example. After saving the day it reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the merchant Ivan</span> is actually a relative of the king who was searching for his long lost brother <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which would be you.</span> In an interview it's actually <em>stated</em> that both characters are related to the king, but it never says if they're related to one another. It still just strongly hints too it.
<ul><li> Other examples from the same interview is that Iris is not a vampire and probably not a purebred of whatever her species then is, No one knows where the Saint-Coquilles money comes from, and Sharron is "probably not human." (Which is no more information than what's heavily implied in the game itself)

Though he has said that he knows what really happened (fitting with reason 5 above), it also fits with one of the themes of the series, namely about truth (and the subjectivity of it) which says that the readers has to figure it out themselves and create their own truth.

<div class="indent">I think everyone is getting way too hung up on "What If's" that would have essentially led to Malack not being in the story the way that he needed to be in the story. The role required was for an evil vampire cleric to make friends with Durkon, so that later they could turn on each other; if he wasn't evil, and he wasn't a cleric, he wouldn't have been in the story at all. Maybe there are other vampires out there doing other things, being Good and living in harmony with the world. Don't care. Don't need them for this story.

Ask him about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Tex</a>, though, and he instantly shuts up.

</li><li> The official policy of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSalvationWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSalvationWar">The Salvation War</a></em> is that, as far as possible, everything that happens has some kind of rational, scientific explanation. In some cases, the divergence between the demands of mythology and what is scientifically plausible is so great that it cannot be bridged. To get around this (and to give the Angels and Daemons some hope of surviving the massed human firepower being thrown at them), it is stipulated that the laws of physics on Earth and in Heaven/Hell are slightly different. This results in the characters saying they have no idea why this thing is happening, so they're just going to accept that it does for now. This is, of course, the scientific method at work "we don't understand it but we'll study it until we do." Meanwhile, the engineering method of finding an empirical solution by trial and error is used to create a work-around. In some cases, these shrugs are actually puzzles that are solved later in the story line.

</li><li> For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em>, this trope came into place for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChannelChasers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChannelChasers">Channel Chasers</a></em>, which depicted Timmy's two children Tommy and Tammy, whose mother was never seen nor mentioned. Butch Hartman decided to respond with that there is no answer to who their mother is and that she can be whoever you want her to be.
</li><li> A common question <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> fans wondered was whether other characters or the Griffins could understand what Stewie was saying. When asked this question (on the early season DVDs), creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethMacFarlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethMacFarlane">Seth MacFarlane</a> replied, "Well, Brian can understand him." Chris also seems to understand him just fine. The topic has also been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> several times. The general rule of thumb has been that while everyone understands him, the older characters generally don't take his statements seriously or at face value, but this is sometimes subverted for a joke, too.
<ul><li> Fans also want to know who killed Brian. The creators jokingly claim it was Justin Bieber.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregWeisman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregWeisman">Greg Weisman</a>, writer of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em>, can go into this territory. Admittedly, he's already revealed much of what would've (and may yet eventually) happen had the story been allowed to continue. So now fans wind up asking questions that get the simple answer of "I'm not going to answer that at this time" or some variant thereof. Man's gotta keep some secrets.
<ul><li> When ever asked about the color of a character that has yet appeared in the show or comics, Greg refuses to answer because he is color blind and needs help with the coloring choice of his characters.
</li><li> Weisman is very fond of answering with "No comment" when asked about specific elements relating to the world of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>. Oftentimes, it appears that he does so in order to avoid potential spoilers about future episodes.

He's come up with a number of unorthodox things to put in place of spoilers, including pictures of an Axolotl—which becomes a bizarre sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, as there's a backward message from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a dying Bill Cipher</span> calling out to "Axolotl" as if invoking the power of a god. Additionally, there are other questions he just doesn't want to ever answer, which includes many that are just inappropriate (such as questions to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyJewish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyJewish">the Pines family's religion</a>). A decent number of the bigger questions are answered in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GravityFallsJournal3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GravityFallsJournal3">Gravity Falls: Journal 3</a></em>, however, such as Dipper's real name.
</li><li> Edward Kay has been this way about a few aspects of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes">Jimmy Two-Shoes</a></em>, such as the characters' ages, the full extent of Lucius' powers, if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Jimmy and Heloise are getting together</a>, and (the biggest one of all), the true nature of Miseryville. On that last one, he compared it to Franz Kafka's <em>The Metamorphosis</em>, saying that Jimmy may literally be in Hell (as most fans believe), be in an alien world/dimension, or even just be dreaming in a coma.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em>: Throughout the series, Mr. Cat is portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBi">Ambiguously Bi</a>. The creators themselves have stated that they do not know what his sexuality is.

Creator Rad Sechrist has said that all the writers have their own ideas and that no character in-universe knows either. He and producer Bill Wolkoff also said in one interview that even if they sat down and came up with a single satisfying answer, it wouldn't matter, since there would be no way to actually address it in the show itself without completely veering away from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a>.

<ul><li> Lauren Faust, the former producer of the show, likes to occasionally answer questions about the show in her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/DeviantArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/DeviantArt">DeviantArt</a> comments page. Several times, though, she has refused to answer questions, saying that she has an idea of the answer, but doesn't want to tie herself down to any particular position when a different answer might come up later as a plot point, and sometimes the process of writing produces more interesting answers than trying to figure it out ahead of time. Other times, she's mentioned that she simply doesn't have an answer because it's not really something she goes out of her way to think about.

<div class="indent"><strong>Jayson Thiessen</strong>: hehe
</div></li><li> After the premiere of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS9E26TheLastProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS9E26TheLastProblem">The Last Problem</a>," the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> with also featured a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, a Q&amp;A was held with showrunner Big Jim Miller on Twitter. Miller revealed that a lot of things which fans wondered about (including in that episode) were intentionally left vague, never got discussed, or were outside of his control to conceivably answer.
<ul><li> The writers were toying with a subtle nod to the idea of Appledash (Applejack x Rainbow Dash) and Yonabar (Yona x Sandbar), and had a more concrete indication that Fluttercord (Fluttershy x Discord) was canon. Ultimately, they decided to make the moments in question more ambiguous to allow fans to continue playing and debating about said ships. Applejack x Rainbow Dash would obviously confirm the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">Fanon</a> theory that Rainbow Dash is a lesbian. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> simply said it was wrong to assume Rainbow Dash is a lesbian simply based on stereotypes.
</li><li> As to whether or not characters who didn't appear in the episode after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> were dead, Miller said that just because someone didn't appear doesn't mean they're dead.
</li><li> A lot of "what happened to [Character X]?" questions either never got an answer from the crew, or Hasbro never approved an idea that used them. As such, Miller said that it's up to the fans to decide.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The creators of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em> claim that the title characters have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge">no definitive age</a> (despite being nine in the pilot), just that they are "less than fifteen." They did this after making seeing how well different age groups all identified with them. (Eventually, they were said to be ten years old.)
<ul><li> Likewise they won't bother answering questions about Ferb's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">Missing Mom</a> or Phineas's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Disappeared Dad</a>; they would rather fans just focus on the Flynn-Fletchers as a happy blended family. Fans speculate, however, that the episode "What Do It Do?" <em>may</em> have been meant to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed">Joss</a> the fan theory that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Doofenshmirtz</a></span> is Phineas' father, as he mentions having met Linda only once years before Phineas could have been born.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's not Doof,</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">they said so in an interview</a>. Not that this stops fanfic writers from making him so; you wouldn't believe how many stories there are that use this.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnKricfalusi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnKricfalusi">John Kricfalusi</a>, creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow">The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show</a></em>, apparently answered the question of whether Ren and Stimpy were gay with "I don't know, it's none of my business."
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlipFlopOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlipFlopOfGod">Of course, then ''Adult Party Cartoon'' made them out-and-out gay</a>, but most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">people exposed to that show throw it out of continuity...</a>
</li><li> On the <em>Adult Party Cartoon</em> DVD, John K. states that Ren &amp; Stimpy's sexuality varies from episode to episode. The show ran on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity">Negative Continuity</a> from day one.
</li></ul></li><li> In an old <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> magazine, an avid fan wrote a highly detailed analysis of the (then mostly unexplored) question of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield">which state Springfield is in</a>. After ultimately eliminating all 50 states, he asked Matt Groening for the answer. His response? "Springfield exists in a state of confusion, but mostly it's a state of mind."
<ul><li> One commentary explains that Groening came up with the name under the impression that it was the most used city name in America, but later found out it's actually Riverside. This gives him an idea for an episode where the Simpsons move to one of those Riversides.
</li><li> Upgraded to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>—after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">more than twenty years</a>, Springfield has finally been revealed to be in the state of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/04/10/impsons-creator-real-springfield-is-in-oregon/">Oregon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.</span> YMMV on how wise a decision it was to make it official...
<ul><li> Groening has since gone on record to say that while he loosely based it on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Springfield, Oregon</span>, that does not necessarily mean it is its location in the show. "The true location of Springfield is in any state but yours." In other words, we're back to square one... Unless you believe David Silverman, who directed the most episodes of the series and has stated that Springfield is in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the fictional state of North Takoma</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsonsMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsonsMovie">The Simpsons Movie</a></em> revealed that it's nowhere. Flanders says that the four states bordering Springfield are Ohio, Nevada, Maine and Kentucky. No state like that exists and if one did it'd have to be huge.
</li></ul></li><li> Let's not forget that "West Springfield" is three times the size of Texas. Not the city or state, the desert area outside the city. So if this is true then yes, in their universe, Oregon (?) is a colossal mega-state which takes up a majority of the landmass of North America. Seems legit.
</li><li> Then there's also episode 248, "Behind the Laughter", which had this closing line in its first run: "The future looks brighter than ever for this Northern Kentucky family". However, this particular line was actually written multiple times and reruns change which location is stated.
</li></ul></li><li> The question of "Who is Mysterion?" from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> episode "The Coon". In the original commentary, Trey Parker and Matt Stone flat-out stated that they don't know who Mysterion is, and that there was no specific character who they intended Mysterion to be. Fans continued to debate the issue and presented evidence backing up various theories, with Clyde and Kenny usually being the most popular candidates. The issue was finally revisited in the three-part "Coon And Friends" Trilogy, with a fan poll between the first and second parts about who viewers thought he might be. (In case you're wondering, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyKilledKenny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyKilledKenny">Kenny</a></span>.)
<ul><li> They claim on the commentary they decided his identity very late during production on "the first one", and seem to mean the original episode, but its a little unclear.
</li><li> Matt and Trey don't tend to plan too far ahead, and generally answer questions in a very casual off-the-cuff manner, so many of their statements can appear Shrug of God.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> During a charity drawing livestream with Alex Hirsch, series creator Rebecca Sugar mentioned that Gems use hard light constructs for their bodies, causing the former to ask what would happen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion">if a Gem spent a long time in the dark</a>. Sugar wasn't comfortable answering, so Hirsch retracted the question apologetically.
</li><li> Writers Ben Levin and Matt Burnett were once asked what would happen if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">post-resurrection Lars</span> went into Lion's Pocket Dimension, then went through the other portal that comes out of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his own head</span>. Both admitted to not considering such a strange situation, but theorize things like creating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveReality">Recursive Reality</a> or self-duplication. The show's creator <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/comments/aidc83/rebecca_lamar_and_miki_here_ask_us_anything/een8wm4/?context=8&amp;depth=9">later stated<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> it would be a combination of the two.

</li><li> In a much different version of this, Marty Isenberg said they have no idea the significance of Professor Sumdac's name being "Cadmus" backwards as it was decided before they got involved.
</li><li> More recently, Wyatt has refused to answer questions about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">how Sari's protoform appeared in Isaac's lab</span>. If that story is going to be told, it's going to be in some form of new Animated fiction.

<ul><li> They've openly admitted that they don't plan anything, so chances are if it hasn't been written into an episode, they don't know the answers any more than the fans.
