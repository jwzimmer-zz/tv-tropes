To add insult to injury, the totality of the Wilding fleet has escaped and the leftover corpses are so mangled and so few it's unlikely they'll manage to revive <em>anybody</em>.

In the end, after Big Show punched out Cena and walked away from the ring, Ziggler was the only remaining member of Team Cena, who would successively pin Kane, Harper and Rollins, giving Team Cena the win. On the December 29 Raw, Seth Rollins threatened to curbstomp special guest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge">Edge</a>, who had retired from multiple neck injuries, demanding that Cena bring back the Authority after little more than a month of exile. Cena had no other choice but to grant Rollins' demand, and as a result, Ziggler, Rowan and Ryback were temporarily fired, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourApprovalFillsMeWithShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourApprovalFillsMeWithShame">Cena was applauded by Triple H and Stephanie</a> for bringing them back into power.
</li><li> After the breakup of Special K, The Lovely Lacey <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">dumped</a> Izzy and Deranged in favor of managing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimmyJacobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimmyJacobs">Jimmy Jacobs</a> and BJ Whitmer. However they ended up being a less effective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam">Tag Team</a> as Lacey's Angels, mostly due to Lacey's attempts to "improve" Jacobs, which caused Whitmer to turn on him when Jacobs's concern for Lacey led to them losing an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">RoH</a> Title match to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AustinAries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AustinAries">Generation</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoderickStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoderickStrong">Next</a>. Lacey didn't care about Jacobs but felt Whitmer had betrayed her personally and ordered Jacobs to put him out of wrestling. This led to a one-sided feud where Whitmer almost killed Jacobs with power bombs on two separate occasions. And when Jacobs finally did manage to give Whitmer an injury Jacobs was so injured himself he required crutches.

Though Taker won the match, moving his WrestleMania undefeated streak to 19-0, he was so worn out afterwards that he couldn't even stand up to do his darkness salute. Taker had to be taken out on a stretcher while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a>, the loser, was at least able to walk to the back under his own power. This would later be the reason for their rematch one year later at WrestleMania 28. Undertaker wasn't happy with him having to be taken out of the arena on a stretcher.
</li><li> Any gruesomely tiring or injurious match can be turned into one of these for the WWE Champion thanks to the introduction of the Money in the Bank briefcase. The briefcase can be cashed it at any time for a WWE Championship match, even if the champion is too worn out to properly defend their title. Notably, this is how the first cash-in went, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge">Edge</a> defeating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> in a short match after a bruised and bloody Cena had just defended the title in an Elimination Chamber match.

<ul><li> Can happen in sports if the effort to secure a win leaves players either injured or too exhausted to continue competing successfully. In the 2014 NBA Western Conference Finals, the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the San Antonio Spurs decisively in two consecutive home games. The second game of the two was clearly going in the Thunder's favor from early on, and the Spurs had conceded defeat and opted to cut their losses by playing deep bench players with little experience (thereby giving their more experienced players rest for the next game). However, the unexpected tenacity of the Spurs' deep bench forced the Thunder to continue playing their starters for far longer than would normally be expected in a blowout win. As a result, the Thunders' starters were exhausted during the next game and lost by a wide margin — before ultimately losing the series.
</li><li> The LSU Tigers' victory in the 2011 SEC Championship Game eventually turned out to be this. Going in, LSU was the #1 team in the country. At #2 was the Alabama Crimson Tide, who just so happened to play in the same division as the Tigers, who were ranked ahead of them largely by virtue of winning their regular-season matchup. Because of that victory, LSU earned the trip to Atlanta over the Tide and demolished Georgia 42-10. Their prize, aside from the trophy: A rematch with Alabama in the <em>national</em> championship game, which the Tigers lost in humiliating fashion, 21-0.
</li><li> In the 2010 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wimbledon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wimbledon">Wimbledon</a> Tennis Championships, John Isner and Nicolas Mahut played the longest tennis match by far, clocking over 11 hours. John Isner won the match eventually with 70-68 in the fifth set. However, Isner had to play the next day again. He was visibly exhausted and required treatment for neck and shoulders. Result: he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">defeated</a> in the shortest match of the men's Wimbledon match at that point in 2010.
<ul><li> This ultimately happened to Andy Murray. His determination to beat one of the Top 4 and win a Grand Slam so he could bring honor back to British tennis, caused him to play a lot of matches while he was dealing with minor injuries and didn't give his body proper time to rest. He eventually succeeded, winning three Grand Slams and he became the world's number 1 player for a brief time. Unfortunately, his refuse to let his body rest caused those minor injuries to become major ones, until he announced at the 2019 Australian Open after being out of action for over a year that he was retiring at the end of the tennis season due to an unrelenting hip injury. He then backed out of his retirement plans, undergoing a risky surgery. Murray recovered well enough that he was on the tour in doubles by the time of Wimbledon, but it remains to be seen how successful his comeback will be.
</li></ul></li><li> The early days of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts">MMA</a> were plagued by Pyrrhic victories.
<ul><li> The early format of UFC was an eight-man single elimination bracket, where the winner would in theory win three fights in one night. However, the tournament would often be riddled with withdrawals due to fatigue or injuries. UFC 11 ended without a final match because they had run out of competitors who were able to fight.
</li><li> Pride, the Japanese equivalent of UFC, had a similar incident at the Pride Grand Prix 2000 Finals, also a single elimination tournament. Kazushi Sakuraba vs. Royce Gracie, often regarded as one of the greatest fights in MMA history, lasted 90 minutes because Gracie demanded that the fight have unlimited rounds with no rules. Gracie withdrew after the sixth 15-minute round. Sakuraba only made it through one round of his semifinal match before withdrawing due to fatigue. Ironically, in the other semifinal match, Kazuyuki Fujita withdrew two seconds into his semifinal match due to an injury he suffered in his first match of the night.
</li></ul></li><li> Hosting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames">Olympic Games</a> can promote a city's infrastructural and cultural prowess, but it doesn't come cheap. The Summer Olympics in Montreal 1976 and Athens 2004 are particularly infamous examples — Montreal took 30 years to break even, leading its Olympic Stadium a.k.a. "The Big O" to be nicknamed "The Big Owe".
</li><li> The January 2016 Wild Card Playoff Game between the Cincinnati Bengals and the Pittsburgh Steelers did end in embarrassing fashion for the Bengals, who surrendered 30 yards of personal foul penalties on one play in the final minute to hand the Steelers the field position for a chip shot field goal to win 18-16. However, few Steelers fans were celebrating, as the source of the first fifteen personal foul yards was a concussion to star wide receiver Antonio Brown, who was <em>knocked unconscious</em> from an illegal helmet-to-helmet hit from Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0arw9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0arw9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0arw9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">who served a three game suspension the next season for the blatant hit, the most notable in a string of dangerous hits that have come to define his style</span> (the other fifteen came after fellow Bengal Adam "Pac-Man" Jones got into a confrontation with Steelers linebacker coach Joey Porter) Brown wound up being ruled out for the Divisional Round matchup against the Denver Broncos, which combined with a hobbled Ben Roethlisberger (who'd been injured on a hard but legal hit from Burfict earlier in the fourth quarter) and a crippled run game (both star runner Le'Veon Bell<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ykhi');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ykhi" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ykhi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">himself injured in a regular season game after an illegal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">hit from Burfict</a></span> and veteran backup DeAngelo Williams were already injured, handing run duties to Fitzgerald Toussaint), led to the Steelers losing to the Broncos as their top-ranked defense, free of having to worry about covering Brown, shut down the rest of Pittsburgh's receiving corps as well as what little remained of their run game.
</li><li> The USFL, a spring competitor to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague">NFL</a> that ran from 1983-1985 with some success, decided to move the 1986 season to the fall to compete against the NFL. The real reason behind the move was because a group of owners, led by New Jersey Generals owner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>, believed the move to the fall would trigger either a large settlement in a Federal Anti-Trust Lawsuit, the admission of some of the teams into the NFL, or both. At the time the NFL aired on all 3 major broadcast networks and those networks declined adding (or in the case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC">ABC</a> retaining) the USFL if it meant dropping the NFL. The legal case of USFL vs NFL was technically decided in the favor of the USFL, but the jury felt the USFL really did everything in their power to destroy themselves by not contacting the new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Fox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Fox">Fox</a> network, moving from the less demanding spring season, and failing to accept a deal from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ESPN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ESPN">ESPN</a> (who agreed to maintain the broadcasts with the new season date). The USFL victory was $1, tripled to $3 under US federal law. The 1986 season was cancelled, the league folded, and none of the remaining owners have, as of 2019, ever owned a team in the NFL.
</li><li> Probably the most famous NFL example is the 1981 Divisional Round game between the Miami Dolphins and San Diego Chargers. While the Chargers won to move on to the AFC Championship Game, it required a double overtime that left the players utterly exhausted. The most famous image of the game is star San Diego tight end Kellen Winslow being carried off the field by two teammates after carrying the San Diego pass attack. This exhaustion, coupled with the extreme cold in Cincinnati, is usually blamed for the Chargers losing next week to the Cincinnati Bengals.
</li><li> In the world of Bodybuilding, Ronnie Coleman is considered one of the greatest of all times. He won 8 Mr. Olympia titles, being one of the only two who surpassed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> who won 7 titles, the other being Lee Haney. However, he paid a heavy price by suffering a back spinal cord injury which has resulted in 7 surgeries and counting in order to rebuild his back and prevent him from becoming paralyzed. Nowadays, he walks using crutches and suffers from constant pain, but tries his best to keep a positive attitude.
</li><li> The demise of the DiGard Motorsports <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR">NASCAR</a> team in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEighties">The '80s</a>. DiGard had been one of the more successful teams in NASCAR during the late 1970s and early 1980s with drivers such as Darrell Waltrip and Bobby Allison. However, by the mid-1980s DiGard began running into financial difficulties despite Allison having won the Winston Cup<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note24a8x');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note24a8x" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note24a8x');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">now Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series</span> championship in 1983. Where this came into play was the 1985 Pepsi Firecracker 400<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note384gh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note384gh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note384gh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">now Coke Zero Sugar 400</span> summer race at Daytona on July 4, 1985. For that race, DiGard entered a second car (an unsponsored #10 car used normally for research and development and driven by Greg Sacks) that was supposed to provide information for the team by running a few laps before heading to the garage (effectively becoming one of NASCAR's earliest "start and park" incidents). However, Sacks began racing quite well and ended up going on to win the race. However, soon afterwards Allison - angered over feeling that resources were being diverted from his car - bolted the team and took the car's Miller Brewing sponsorship with him, racing the remainder of the year for his own team before finishing his career with the Stavola Brothers team. Also departing around that time was iconic engine builder Robert Yates, who later moved to the Ranier-Lundy team and ultimately buying that team; renaming it Robert Yates Racing. Their departures would prove too much for the cash-strapped DiGard team, which ran a part-time schedule in 1986 before going out of business early in the 1987 NASCAR season.

The fluff has even more examples:
<ul><li> The original Pyrrhic Victory would be the Imperium's triumph over Chaos during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy">Horus Heresy</a>. The renegade Warmaster was defeated, but the Emperor was mortally wounded and placed on life support, leaving him incommunicado for the ten thousand years since. His Imperium, founded on humanism and atheistic science, degenerates into a totalitarian theocracy where he is worshiped as a god while the local "engineers" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineWorship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineWorship">worship their tanks</a>. Humanity is so weakened by the conflict that civilization has never recovered to its heights at the Imperium's founding. And if the Emperor had been given just a <em>little</em> more time to perfect his Warp Gate, he could've revolutionized galactic transportation so that it wouldn't rely on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace">Warp travel</a> and mutant Navigators.
</li><li> Earlier than that, the Eldar god of war, Kaela Mensha Khaine, managed to defeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">the Nightbringer</a> during the near-mythical War in Heaven, but Khaine was nearly killed and the battle gave all sentient life an intrinsic fear of death (all sentient life <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FearlessFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FearlessFool">except the Orks, anyway</a>). On the other hand, when Khaine battled Slaanesh during the Fall of the Eldar, even through his defeat he managed to weaken the Chaos God enough for Cegorach to escape and Nurgle to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbductionIsLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbductionIsLove">rescue</a>" Isha.
</li><li> Most victories against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts">Tyranids</a>. It takes a staggering amount of manpower and war material to stop a Hive Fleet, and there's always another one lurking in the void. The 'Nids even use this on the battlefield, forcing their enemy to waste ammunition on swarms of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">Cannon Fodder</a> before launching the attack proper. The more extreme method of using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">Exterminatus</a> on worlds under Tyranid attack is a <em>two-way</em> Pyrrhic Victory. The Tyranids lose both the potential bio-mass of the planet they were trying to eat as well as that of the forces spent attacking it, but at the same time the Imperium has just sacrificed one of their finite and ever-shrinking number of planets, while the Tyranids seem endless.
<ul><li> Specific examples of this would be the Battle of Macragge <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4u4zs');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4u4zs" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4u4zs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">where the Ultramarines stopped the rampage of Hive Fleet Behemoth at the cost of billions of lives, hundreds of worlds, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">sacrifice</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy">elite Ultramarines 1st Company</a></span> and the Battle of Iyanden <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5w90h');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5w90h" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5w90h');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">where, with the help of Prince Yriel and his Eldritch Raiders, the Eldar were able to overcome Hive Fleet Kraken at the cost of four-fifths of the Craftworld's population, and Prince Yriel had to take up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Spear of Twilight</a> which will inevitably slowly kill him</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Eldrad's destruction of Abaddon's Planet Killer broke the back of the Thirteenth Black Crusade, but the Farseer locked himself in eternal conflict with the daemonic spirits controlling the warship and was hurled into the depths of the Warp.
</li><li> The Dark Angels defeated The Fallen but their home planet was destroyed.
</li><li> On a meta level, world-wide "you determine the result" campaigns fall into this, since having one side flat-out lose would irritate players. So while global campaigns have ended in Imperial (specifically Space Marine) victories, reading deeper reveals that their enemies made off with some powerful artifact or achieved their true objectives. As an example, the Dark Eldar were defeated in the Medusa campaign, but snatched so many slaves that they'll be able to gorge themselves for eons.
</li><li> A villainous example with the Fall of Cadia in the new 13th Black Crusade.

The Cadian Pylons were highly valuable and the entire reason he was attacking the planet in the first place. With it gone, he "won", but lost the reason he had spent so long waging war against Cadia to begin with.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Battletech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Battletech">Battletech</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Amaris Civil War ends up as one for the SLDF. Even though they won, Kerensky's forces were so savaged as to be almost impotent to keep the Successor States from ultimately carving up the Terran Hegemony (the central state of the Star League) amongst themselves, launching the First Succession War. In the end, Kerensky <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">orders the SLDF to leave the Inner Sphere altogether</a>, as the Star League he'd sworn to protect and had spent 10 years and countless lives to liberate imploded around him.
</li><li> At the conclusion of the Refusal War between Clan Jade Falcon and Clan Wolf, the Falcons ended up winning it in this manner. Three reasons why it led to this outcome: 1) despite the fact that the Falcons managed to wear down the Wolves by sending in less experienced second-line units and then eventually killed off both Natasha and Ulric Kerensky with underhanded ambushes, they unknowingly failed to eliminate Vlad Ward, who eventually became a sole witness to their uncharacteristically cowardly acts and took issue with them later on, 2) after rubbing out most of the Wolves, they tried to eliminate the Wolves' offshoot faction Clan Wolf-In-Exile (which comprised of the original Warden members of their parent Clan) but were fiercely pushed back by Phelan Kell and his Kell Hounds mercenary unit, therefore failing to prevent their escape to the Inner Sphere and 3) after taking a horrendously unacceptable amount of casualties inflicted by the aforementioned factions, the Falcons were rendered completely unable to resume the Invasion of the Inner Sphere so much that they had no choice but to absorb the remaining Wolves who did not break off to join Clan Wolf-In-Exile in order to re-bolster what little manpower they had left. Things took a turn for the worse for the Falcons when Vlad Ward, who had survived the war, witnessed their suspicious strategies and called out their two highest ranked leaders, saKhan Vandervahn Chistu and Khan Elias Crichell, for their acts by initiating his own Trials of Refusal and eventually defeated them both to death; the former in traditional one-on-one BattleMech combat and the latter getting literally beaten to death in one-on-one hand-to-hand combat on the floor of the Clan Grand Council when the Falcon Khan was just elected as the next ilKhan to resume the invasion despite his old age and his Clan already saddled with the aforementioned casualties. Vlad, now the newly appointed Wolf Khan, then reconstructed the Wolves by turning them into a Crusader Clan that bore no relevant history with the original Warden era and now resets their goal of retaking Terra and conquering the Inner Sphere again all to restore the glory of the Clan and immortalize his own name, once the Truce of Tukayyid expires.
</li></ul></li><li> This is the real heart behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MugglePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MugglePower">Muggle Power</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a></em>. Whilst breaking the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">masquerade</a> is dangerous for supernaturals on a local level, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnmasquedWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnmasquedWorld">The Unmasqued World</a> would probably not turn out very well for <em>either</em> humans or monsters.
<ul><li> For humans, fighting a full-fledged war against the supernatural is kind of like fighting a war on terrorists turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>, since monsters have all the advantages of terrorists, such as being part of the general populace, blending in with "normal people", etc, but add a whole arsenal of supernatural powers to it. But what really makes the war fit this trope is that, after all the damage humanity will do to itself in the process, A: it's not really possible to stop new generations of monsters from coming into being, and B: often, those monsters are keeping something <em>even worse</em> in check, and so getting rid of them leads to a power vaccuum. Case in point; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheForsaken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheForsaken">Uratha</a> are scary, being a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent">lupine</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">shapeshifters</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItCanThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItCanThink">human-tier intelligence</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> powerful enough to make them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh Invulnerable</a>, especially when they go into their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a>. But if humanity somehow wipes out werewolves, then that leads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell">The Legions of Hell</a> who inhabit an animistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkWorld">Dark World</a> now being able to swarm into the mortal world in an epidemic of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Demonic Possession</a>, as keeping those evil spirits in check is a werewolf's <em>job</em>.

</li><li> For monsters, not only does humanity outnumber them, but the truth of the matter is that the shape the world is in rather benefits them. All species of monsters ultimately <em>need</em> humans, for food and procreation, without taking into account personal attachments. To achieve a supernatural victory in a "war of man vs. monster" would require such a massive amount of casualties and planetary devastation that the world wouldn't be much fun for the monsters afterwards, either.
</li><li> And, regardless of who may be making progress towards victory, there's still one big problem that makes the fighting meaningless. Namely, the existence of God-tier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a> like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheDescent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheDescent">God-Machine</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening">Exarchs</a> who actively like the world the way it is and are willing to use all their powers, up to and including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">resetting time and reshuffling space</a>, to keep things as they prefer.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em> setting, everyone came out of the Last War in bad shape and nobody really got what they wanted in the compromises that ended the War, except for King Kaius of Karrnath who just wanted it all to <em>stop</em>. Karrnath had been savaged by the war, forced to turn to necromancy and pacts with the Lich Queen Vol to survive at all. In return, Vol turned Kaius into a vampire and heavily infiltrated his government and army with her own agents. For Kaius, his "victory" was the mere survival of his people, but aside from the more traditional costs of this trope, it also took his humanity and left him beholden to one of the most powerful and villainous mages in the world.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TechInfantry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TechInfantry">Tech Infantry</a></em>, every battle in the story is one of these, if not an outright defeat. The first Jurvain invasion of Rios is destroyed, at the cost of a jump gate, then a rebel attack is driven off with such heavy cost in Council Loyalist ships that when a second Jurvain invasion comes in, there's effectively nothing to stop them. The rebel fleet attacks the Federation capital in Avalon, and is again driven off at the cost of such heavy Federation casualties that future offensive operations against anyone are impossible. And the Vin Shriak is defeated, at the cost of so weakening the Federation that they are powerless to resist a subsequent invasion by the Eastern Bloc and their alien allies.
</li><li> A game of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Citadels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Citadels">Citadels</a></em> ends when a player builds their 8th district. However, a player's score is primarily determined by the <em>value</em> of their districts; this means that a player can be the first to "complete" their city, only to find out that the opponent - who took the time to build rich and varied districts - is actually the winner. It's downplayed, because being the first player to "complete" a city gets you bonus points.

The Nalfeshnee would certainly be a horrible threat to the party at that level, but it doesn't stick around long enough to kill them (unless they're really unlucky). However, it will likely have forced them to waste valuable resources before entering one of 5th edition's most dangerous dungeons.

Mizar can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MesACrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MesACrowd">split-regenerate itself</a> indefinitely when attacked and would overrun the rest of Japan within 24 hours, if it's not dealt with. The Dragon Stream would be able to deal with Mizar, but Yamato says that using the Stream would require to cut the power to the towers, which serve as a barrier to Japan and keep it safe. Cutting the power means cutting their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered">time</a> in defeating the rest of the Septentrione.

Arcturus may have been defeated at last by Yamato Hotsuin and Al Saiduq, but at the cost of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">everyone else being dead, Tokyo being in complete ruins</span> and Al Saiduq even mentions that things seem beyond repair. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is why he concocted a plan with Yamato to regress the world once more, leading to the third cycle of the world and a hopefully better victory against Arcturus</span>.

The Collectors are no longer a threat to humankind, but Shepard and Shepard's squad die achieving this, and the Reapers are still on the way. Wasting too much time before assaulting the base, on the other hand, can see Shepard too late to rescue the Normandy's crew - maybe thirty or so innocent people and allies.

One way or another, every major quest carries a penalty to match its triumph - some nastier than others, especially if Shepard doesn't exercise good judgement. And much like the previous game, going into the final assault without enough preparation can potentially cost you the war, even if you win the battle. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The ending itself proves the Reapers cannot be eliminated as a threat without a heavy price, no matter which option Shepard chooses.</span>
</li><li> The outcome of the final battle, if you pick Refusal - your forces successfully punched through the Reaper lines and deployed the Crucible, which was the objective... but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because you didn't <em>use</em> it, even with full readiness and about seven thousand points of effective military strength, you, all of your allies and all space-faring races are exterminated.

In <em>Tiberium Wars</em>, it's revealed that the cure discovered at the end of <em>Tiberian Sun</em> was not only ineffective, it caused Tiberium to mutate, becoming even more toxic than before and causing 80% of the world to either be thrown back into the dark ages or become dangerously inhospitable. By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianTwilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianTwilight">Tiberian Twilight</a></em>, Tiberium not only took over the world, but threatens to kill off the entire human race within 6 years.

Too bad you only saved a few hundred people, at <em>least</em> the entire continental United States is still zombified, and there's no word from the rest of the world. But still...New York! Ayyyy!
</li><li> The ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RefleX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RefleX">RefleX</a></em> is this, but in a much more global scale; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">ZODIAC Ophiuchus</a> defeats the last ZODIAC and seals away the 12 cores along with its own. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">However, the collateral damage caused during its quest to destroy the other 12 wiped out almost all of humankind,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">and it may take centuries or even millenniums for them to regain civilization.</a>

But if you don't meet all the prerequisites, you get secondary endings (the only one of which is actually good involves the use of a legendary sword). One of these involves the hero sacrificing all her energy and half-destroying the universe to kill it off (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpiteOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpiteOfANail">STILL might not be enough</a>, so you need some party members that will survive the event, namely your angel/demon characters) just to end the demon's rampage, and the second involves an exorcist ringing a bell that is deadly to everyone who hears it, taking herself out as well. Either of these losses completely wrecks party morale, and the group splits up thereafter.)</span>
</li><li> While the effect of the final battle wasn't immediate upon the protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em>, many players assumed that he was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">just sleeping when he closes his eyes in Aigis' lap on the final day of the game. It turns out he actually fell into his last coma and died soon afterward. The sequel, <em>Persona 3: FES</em>, shows us what effect the protagonist's death has upon the rest of the party. The reveal that the protagonist actually sacrificed his life to become the barrier between Nyx and humanity becomes the main point of contention between the entire party, especially for Yukari, who spends most of the game wanting to see him again, to the point where she would be willing to reset time even if it meant dooming the rest of humanity</span>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">bad ending</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em> where you choose to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kill Namatame.

Ventus defeats Vanitas inside his own mind, destroying the X-Blade and stopping the other part of the plan. However the damage to his heart is so severe that he's rendered comatose while his heart seeks safety within Sora's. Aqua finishes off Xehanort's plans for good, except both her friends are gone, she inadvertently sets off the events that would put the first game into motion, and she's stuck wandering the Realm of Darkness alone for years.</span> However, unlike most Pyrrhic Victories, there is the hope of Sora saving them all.

</li><li> <em>White Tigerzord vs Epyon</em>: Even though Zechs manages to destroy the tigerzord and kill Tommy Oliver the White Ranger, his beloved girlfriend, Noin, was killed before the start of the battle. The battle ends with him crying Ocular Gushers over the remains of the Gundam she was piloting, while Zordon is left mourning Tommy's death.
</li><li> Possibly the case in <em>Guts vs Nightmare</em>. Guts manages to destroy Nightmare/Night Terror, Inferno and Soul Edge, but he was forced into his Berserker Armor to do so.

Plus, the DMX battle that accompanies this one revealed Dante's partner Trish was killed by Bayonetta's partner Jeanne.
</li><li> <em>Joker vs Sweet Tooth</em>: Joker triumphs by killing Needles Kane (the driver of Sweet Tooth) with Joker Venom, but the beating he took during the battle leaves him in no condition to resist the police who show up, presumably to ship him back to Arkham.
</li><li> <em>Lara Croft vs Nathan Drake</em>: Lara kills Nathan and retrieves the Holy Grail, but her helicopter was destroyed in the process, leaving her stranded in the desert. While she's survived similar conditions, it's still inconvenient.
</li><li> <em>Natsu Dragneel vs Portgas D. Ace</em>: Natsu kills Ace after he attempts to run out of town for not paying for his meal, but it comes at the cost of setting the town on fire.

</li><li> <em>Black Widow vs. Widowmaker</em>: Black Widow kills Widowmaker, but Widowmaker had already killed the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent she was working with.
</li><li> <em>Deadpool vs The Mask</em> is an odd case, as it's not a Pyrrhic Victory for The Mask, but for Wiz and Boomstick. In their eagerness to be rid of Deadpool and his annoying antics forever, they purposefully pitted him against someone he had no chance of defeating, and in doing so they had violated their own impartiality. Their guilt is further fueled by a posthumous letter from Deadpool, thanking them for helping him rediscover himself after getting lost in his internet meme fame.

But then Paul Bunyan becomes upset once he realizes that this would cost many people to not know the wonders of having trees around since they were all cut down. So in the end, Paul Bunyan decided to plant trees across the country to make up for him chopping down all those trees.

When the cruelty of the Sepratists against civilians forces him to change his mind he is quite bitter about the fact that the Republic forces do become an armed occupation, and is proven right about having to fight them eventually when the Republic becomes the Empire. He's leading the rebels fighting the Empire on Ryloth in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em> years later and the Twi'lek people suffer horribly under the Empire, with his own clan being nearly wiped out by slavery and slaughter.

<ul><li> The rebellion ended like this; Rose Quartz won and saved the Earth from the Homeworld's colonization, but it cost her all (except for a small handfill) of her allies to be corrupted and to the creation of the Cluster (a giant forced fusion made up of thousands of Gems) seeded inside the Earth which will destroy it upon formation.

After killing Aku, Jack and Ashi are about to get married... until Ashi vanishes, because when Jack killed Aku, Ashi also ceased to exist.

Grune coins the line "No price is too great for the defeat of my foe" when he rips out his own fang to slay a giant spider. Panthro repeats it when he lets his arms get cut off to ensure Grune's death.

Cue both factions going through a huge battle to take command of the pool, destroying every single piece of life in the glen</span>. Beachcomber's final words as he surveys the scene? "We won..."
</li><li> This is especially paradoxical, since the Autobots have explained time and again that their mission was to "protect life"... apparently, completely destroying a glen full of life in order to control a strategic resource doesn't count. But perhaps the message of the episode was on the tragedy of war: letting the Decepticons have something that would have made them invincible would have been such a disaster for all non-Decepticon life that it was better to destroy the glen than to let the Decepticons have it. A few must die that others may live; that's called war.
