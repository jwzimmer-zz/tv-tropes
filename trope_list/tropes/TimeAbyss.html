People usually die within a century or so. Cities and nations may last a few millennia, and we think them old, but the truly old are so much older.They are even shown to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestOnesInTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestOnesInTheBook">The Oldest Ones in the Book</a> in some Literature.
</p><p>They were already old when all the nations we know were born, even those now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTimeOfMyths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTimeOfMyths">vanished into history</a>. They can speak of Ancient Athens and Babylon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeenItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeenItAll">as casually as we might speak of yesterday</a>, for to them those ancient cities <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeDissonance">are but recent memories</a>. They were there when brick was first laid on brick, over five thousand years ago. They may have watched the trilobites come, and go, with eyes older than the stars. They may even be older than time itself.
</p><p>Contemplating such immense spans of time is like looking into an abyss, an inducement to vertigo, for they are more than we can grasp. Oh, we can talk about them easily enough, just more big numbers, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale">we can't intuit them</a>. We all know what a second or a week feels like; a million years (or even ten thousand) is beyond all human experience. It is from this incomprehension that this trope draws its power, when done right, an evocation of incomprehensible age that appeals to our sense of wonder. Naturally, a Time Abyss must experience all the years they claim. It doesn't count if they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">skip over</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle">sleep through them</a>.

Imagine an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDumbObject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDumbObject">alien monolith</a> that has been sitting on the moon for three billion years. Think about all it has seen; the slow dance of the continents, the long march of evolution, the sudden flowering of civilization. Think, and wonder.
</p><p>Geographical features can't qualify, though. We expect the hills to be old as dirt. We do not expect people, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagnarokProofing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagnarokProofing">or any of their works</a>, to be older than the hills.
</p><p>Five thousand years or so is a decent estimate of the <em>minimum</em> age needed to qualify for this trope, excluding any hypothetical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VandalSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VandalSavage">immortal caveman</a>, and yet, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction">Science Fiction</a>, a Time Abyss will typically be far older than that. Geological time scales are usually involved.

<ul><li> <em>The 2000 Year Old Man</em>: as titled, he wouldn't be old enough to qualify, but he claims his oldest memories are of living as a caveman. And he says he met Moses.
</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a> in all incarnations are millions of years old. Some <em>individuals</em> are older than the entire human species.
<ul><li> For an idea, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1">Transformers: Generation 1</a></em> cartoon, Optimus and Megatron had been battling each other for millions of years before arriving to Earth. There's also how Shockwave didn't change much during the four million years the Autobots and the Decepticons in the Ark were in stasis (well, except for being minus one hand).
</li><li> The Thirteen are considered old even by the standards of their species, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersCybertron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersCybertron">Vector Prime</a> and The Fallen. The first creations of Primus, they were old <em>before</em> the war that's been going for millions of years got started. They don't even have faction insignias, since they pre-date their formations by eons (their toys notwithstanding).
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em> the Thirteen are said to have battled Unicron in ancient times. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unicron eventually became Earth by collecting debris as he drifted through space. In the canon novel <em>Exodus</em>, which takes place a few million years ago at most, Alpha Trion, one of the Thirteen, speaks to Optimus. In case you haven't figured it out that means Trion is at least five billion or so years old.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Kup and Alpha Trion from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1">Transformers: Generation 1</a></em>; Alpha Trion was around when the Quintessons were driven from Cybertron — about twelve million years ago. Kup could be anywhere from just as old to maybe "only" ten million years old; he's certainly older than Optimus Prime, who is at least nine million years old. Alpha Trion, in other media, was retconned into being one of the Thirteen, although this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">isn't easy to reconcile</a>.
<ul><li> The Quintessons themselves, or at least the ones who were personally around before they lost Cybertron (e.g. the three-face who built the Transorganic energy-leech) also qualify.
</li></ul></li><li> ...And that's not counting all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">resurrections</a>.
</li><li> Starscream is <em>so</em> good at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">the trope he named</a> that he betrayed <em><strong>time</strong></em>!
<div class="indent"><strong>Starscream:</strong> My <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechanicalLifeforms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechanicalLifeforms">exo-structure</a> was destroyed, but miraculously my <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent">spark</a> endured, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">drifting helplessly</a> thorough the depths of space, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality">beyond the reach</a> of time itself! — <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em>, "Possession"

In fact they're so long-lived that, for many years, Cybertronians believed themselves to be biologically immortal, expressly because they'd never actually seen someone die of old age.
<ul><li> Another continuity (<em>Transformers Regeneration One</em>) has the Transformers aging much faster after their universe is cut-off from Primus, the multiversal being that created the Transformers and influences every universe they appear in.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>, immense temporal units get thrown around casually, emphasizing just how long it is that they can live. For some examples, Ratchet, whose general demeanor is is middle aged, is millions of years old. Meanwhile, in a third season episode flashing back to Prowl's joining of Optimus Prime's team, Prowl claims to have spent a <em>million years</em> in meditation before they disturbed him, and shortly afterwards, Optimus casually refers to 50 or 60 years as being "no time at all" before they can all head back to Cybertron.
</li><li> IDW Kup, mostly seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersRobotsInDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersRobotsInDisguise">The Transformers: Robots in Disguise</a></em>, was already old when he was sent back in time to the beginning of the Dead Universe. Having taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlowPath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlowPath">The Slow Path</a> back to the present before returning to the normal universe none the worse for wear, he is almost definitely older than <em>the universe itself</em>.
</li><li> And then the 80's cartoon gave us Primacron, who in that continuity <em>created</em> Primus, Unicron and the Quintessons, and is still kicking around tampering with Creation in the present day.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> villain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Apocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Apocalypse">Apocalypse</a> was born in ancient Egypt and in various cartoons/comics boasts about things like how 20th/21st century superpowers/technology are no closer to besting him than Babylonian fire sticks were.

<ul><li> According to most major monotheistic religions in the world today, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> is not technically one of these, because age is a foreign concept; time can only be an abyss to those that are bound by it. God wasn't created or born like humans are, He didn't <strong>have</strong> a beginning, He IS the beginning, everything is here because of Him therefore making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Him the abyss rather than time.</a> Titles like Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, the one who was (existed since the beginning), who is (presently is), and who is yet to come (always will exist), the Great I Am are richly deserved.
<ul><li> According to some philosophers, time itself is meaningless to God. He created time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak">and existed before...He existed when...</a>well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">explaining it is hard,</a> though in one analogy God is like the author of a book. At what point does an author exist in his book's — his universe's — internal timeline? He can turn to the first page, or to the last page. He can write scenes out of order, go back and forth, and generally follow no continuity or causality.

</div></div></li><li> Enoch, father of the more famous Methuselah, is sometimes argued to have lived the longest out of all humans named in the Bible. This is because he is mentioned to have been "taken by God" and to "not see death", which is interpreted to mean he never actually died and was carried to Heaven while still alive. Given common Biblical timelines, that would make him around 5,000 years old.
</li><li> A similar argument is sometimes made for Elijah as well, although since he only lived around 900 BC he hasn't quite reached this trope yet.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/HinduMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/HinduMythology">Hindu Mythology</a>, reality and everything within it lasts as long as the lifetime of Brahma the creator. Brahma will live to be a hundred years old, except that a single <em>day</em> in his life is over four billion human years.
<ul><li> Assuming he lived even so much as a hundred <em>days</em>, Brahma would have by then lived for over 400 billion years. To put that in perspective, it's currently believed that the universe is roughly 13.8 billion years old. If we get into years, the number goes into astronomical proportions longer than the predicated life span of the universe. Entire universes could die and be reborn many times over before Brahma ever even reached "middle age", such concepts as "time" and "space" might very well collapse and become meaningless terms as the wear and tear of the eons goes on.
<ul><li> The Shiva Purana states that Vishnu ages one day in the time that it takes Brahma to grow old and die, and that Shiva, in turn, ages one day in the time that it takes Vishnu to grow old and die.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>
<ul><li> In 1st Edition Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons, High Elves have natural lifespans of 1600 years, give or take about two to three centuries. Grey Elves have lifespans of 2000 years, give or take another 300, meaning the normal lifespans of High and Grey Elves float around two millennia. By comparison, the lesser Wood Elves and Dark Elves (AKA Drow) have lifespans of "only" 1350 and 1000 years respectively. A Grey Elf PC in 1st Edition AD&amp;D can easily begin play in his 500s, the human equivalent of roughly the mid-30. This would allow your Elf PC to have lived through the rise and fall of historical human kingdoms, with parents over a millennia old and grandparents old enough to potentially have personally witnessed all of recorded human history. For some reason, the 2nd and later Editions cut Elven lifepans in more than half to a mere 700 years (which had previously been the lifespan of Gnomes in 1st Edition.)
</li><li> Dragons are very much like this. They have about ten age categories, from wyrmling to great wyrm, which takes over a thousand years. <em>Then</em> they're just about fully-grown and live a few more thousand years before old age <em>starts to set in</em>. And some of them can become truly immortal.
<ul><li> Time Dragons, the most powerful of the epic dragons, are truly immortal. Able to travel in time at will, a Time Dragon could be tens of thousands of years old or ten minutes old, and still be a Great Wyrm in both cases thanks to how their age is tied to the time stream. They keep their lairs in places unimaginably distant in space and time, and rarely bother to interact even with gods.
</li></ul></li><li> All <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Aboleths</a> have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory">genetic eidetic memory</a> going back to before the dawn of the gods. They reproduce asexually and inherit the memories of their progenitor. Since they can live indefinitely, it is possible that there are ones still alive that were around before the <em>creation of the current universe</em> (and yes, their race really is that old).
</li><li> Most every planar ruler qualifies, guys like archdevils, demon lords, the Hebdomad, and the like. Such beings are immortal unless they are killed (which rarely happens, given how powerful they are) and some can trace their roots back eons, some to a time before mortals existed. And then there are beings like the Obyriths, the Baernaloths, and Zargon the Returner who ruled their respective planes before the current rulers took over.
</li><li> The 92nd layer of the Abyss, Ulgurshek, is actually a living creature, called a draeden, who is currently trapped because the Abyss <em>grew around it</em>. It's stated that it was ancient <em>before</em> the Abyss started to form.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Celestial Exalted themselves live for a long time, but only one of the currently existing crop actually meets the 5,000-year minimum age requirement for this trope: Chejop Kejak, head of the Bronze Faction of Sidereals. He has the distinction of having been born at the very start of the First Age, making him literally as old as <em>history itself</em> (anything that happened before the First Age is per definition prehistoric). These Celestial Exalted, however, are merely very long-lived demigods. The more powerful of the gods themselves are older still, having been made early in the process of the creation of the universe, making them as old as the concepts they govern.
</li><li> Third Edition introduces a Celestial Exalt older than Kejak: the renegade Sidereal Rakan Thulio, who was born in the time before the First Age, and who tore the thread of his destiny from the Loom of Fate, rendering himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless">The Ageless</a>.
</li><li> The Primordials, and the various beings that were once Primordials (the Yozis and the Neverborn), who pre-date Creation and all of the concepts that make it up, since they're the ones who, well, created everything. Among the Primordials, Oramus predates even his own existence. To be more precise, he is the prototype and represents the <em>possibility of the existence</em> of the Primordials, having known of himself and his siblings when they were merely dreams of their true selves. When Cytherea, the Divine Ignition, gave birth to herself and her Primordial siblings (arguably the first true event in the Exalted chronology), Oramus came into being and said, "<em>I was waiting for you to awaken. I thought it should never happen.</em>"
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Numenera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Numenera">Numenera</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game is set about one billion years into the future. The main feature of the game are artifacts from earlier periods, collectively called numenera, which are based on technology that is like magic to the contemporary people, whose knowledge of history reaches back only for the last thousand years. Given how far in the setting's past the civilizations responsible for the technology rose and fell, the titular numenera can be anywhere from hundreds of thousands to hundreds of millions of years, many likely predating the formation of the setting's single supercontinent.
</li><li> More specifically, the intelligent octopi who live in the oceans are an extremely ancient species, old enough to have seen at least some of the great ancient civilizations rise, flourish and either die out or leave. This is part of the reason they do not interact much with other species — from their perspective, none ever last long enough for any meaningful interaction to occur. This also applies to individual octopi. They managed to make themselves ageless long in the past, and many octopi are thus very old indeed. Their current queen, for instance, is over a million years old.

You'd think that the endless years spent inside the Abyss, the absolutely empty prison of the Fallen, would count as suspended animation of sorts, but no: part of their punishment by God was that they remain <em>fully aware</em> of the void of the Abyss and of their own utter impotence until the end of time. No wonder they hold a grudge against the Big One Upstairs.

<ul><li> The Antediluvians — so named because they were the only vampires who survived the Biblical Flood. They aren't so much vampires as they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">undead gods</a> by the time of the modern age, and they can do truly mindbending things with their power. The Gangrel Antediluvian, for example, apparently earthmelded with the <em>entire planet</em>, and slowly sank deeper as time went on, gently rocked in her slumber by the Earth's core.
</li><li> Elimilech, a 4th generation Malkavian <em>antitribu</em> and Seraph of the Black Hand, has an embrace date given as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">Ruth, 1:3</a> — because he's supposedly the husband of the Biblical Ruth, whose death is mentioned in that verse.

In fact, the Wyrm actually spawned beings who are <em>personifications of its thoughts and feelings</em>, children by its standards, that are still old as time itself.
</li><li> The <em>Gehenna</em> supplement features an optional character that fits the trope even better than the traditional Antediluvians. A 3rd Generation vampire who serves Lilith, and is suggested to be the true clan founder of the Brujah, manages to escape being diablerized by displacing himself from time. However, something goes wrong and he is sent on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlowPath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlowPath">extremely slow path</a> back to the present, living and being fully aware of over 100,000 years passing.

<ul><li> Elder sphinxes are generally older than most mortal civilizations — most of the ones alive on Golarion predate the Age of Darkness, which began nearly ten thousand years before the setting's present day, and recall the days when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePrecursors">The Precursors</a> still ruled the world.
</li><li> Neothelids are immensely long-lived creatures. Most living individuals predate the fall of Azlant more than ten thousand years before the setting's present, having lived for untold millennia in the dark beneath the world.

Immortal Elves such as Harlequin all qualify, having been born in the Fourth World of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Earthdawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Earthdawn">Earthdawn</a>, and lived through all five thousand years of the Fifth World to reach the Sixth, which began in 2012. All Great Dragons were born in the <em>Second</em> World — the Age of Dragons — which was separated from the Fourth by <em>another</em> five thousand year gap.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> contains quite a few examples between the various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">elves,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame">dwarves</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">daemons.</a>
<ul><li> The most notable are certainly the Slann, all of whom have been alive since <em>well</em> before the Coming of Chaos, an event which occurred over 7,000 years ago. Granted, some of them have been in a near-comatose state of meditation since Chaos arrived, but not all have, and some of the ones that haven't can rightly claim they were alive before Man existed. The Saurus, while often dying relatively early due to their lives of constant war, are theoretically as ageless as the Slann — the legendary Saurus warrior Kroq-Gar, for instance, was already an experienced veteran during the Coming of Chaos seven millennia in the past.
</li><li> Among the elves, Malekith the Witch-King was born 4458 years before the founding of the Empire, shortly after the end of the first Chaos incursion, and has ruled over the Dark Elves for the entirety of their history, remaining a constant in the elven civil war while the Phoenix Kings of the High Elves rose and fell. He's still only the second-oldest Elf alive, however — the title of eldest most likely goes to his mother, Morathi, who's still quite alive as well. Elves don't normally live this long — Malekith, Morathi, and other Dark Elf sorcerers have lasted as long as they did entirely through habitual use of dark magic.
</li><li> The High Elf lord Alith Anar is also said to have taken over rule of the realm of Nagarythe shortly after the Dark Elves' rebellion more than five thousand years before the setting's present day.
</li><li> Nagash, the First Necromancer, can possibly claim to be over 5,000 years old depending on how you count all his accumulated time dead. A few other undead (Arkhan, the original Vampires, Settra) have been around just as long without having spent any of that time dead.
</li><li> Dwarfs, while long-lived, don't last as long as elves. However, some have lived long enough to qualify, such as the Ancestor Gods — Grimnir for certain, possibly Grungni and Valaya — and the White Dwarf — who lived more than a thousand years as Snorri Whitebeard, "died", and has been popping up ever since.
</li><li> Even older examples are Durthu, the oldest treeman, who is as old as Athel Loren, a forest the Old Ones seeded when they first arrived on the planet over 10,000 years ago.
</li><li> The Dragon Ogres and Dragons were native to the world prior to the arrival of the Old Ones, and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterProgenitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterProgenitor">Monster Progenitors</a> Krakanrok the Black and Kalgalanos the Black are both still alive, though they're both currently asleep. Krakanrok's oldest living son, Kholek Suneater, is considerably more active and was present at the arrival of Chaos all those millennia ago.

<ul><li> The most notable examples are the formerly mortal gods of the realms, Sigmar, Tyrion, Teclis, Alarielle, Malerion (formerly Malekith) and Nagash, who played large roles in shaping their homelands into being the way that they are. A few deities from the old world, such as the Orc gods Gork and Mork and the Dwarfs' Ancestor Gods, who were already staggeringly ancient to begin with, are also still around.
</li><li> A few mortals have also hung around for very long times, such as the Dwarf Slayer Gotrek, who spent unknown amounts of time wandering in the Warp before remerging in the Mortal Realms, and the Skaven Grey Seer Thanquol, who lived through the End Times and the entire history of the Mortal Realms to become what's likely the oldest living Skaven in existence.

<ul><li> Almost all Eldar live to be at least a thousand years old or so, and some live well over ten thousand (such as Eldrad, who was already a powerful psyker back in the early years of the Imperium), while the Phoenix Lords were around long enough to found ancient schools of war. Dark Eldar meanwhile are made of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityImmorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityImmorality">Immortality Immorality</a>, and on average are even older than most Eldar. Their <em>de facto</em> ruler, Asdrubael Vect, is old enough to have seen the Fall of the Eldar and to remember a time before the Chaos God Slaanesh existed, making him the oldest unambiguously, continuously living thing in the setting, Necrons and the near-dead God-Emperor aside. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Or so he claims, at any rate</a>.
</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Chaos Space Marines</a> are the original Traitor Marines, who rebelled against the Emperor in the Horus Heresy ten thousand years ago. However, they spend most of their time in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">the Eye of Terror</a>, which due to an overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace">the Warp</a> lacks anything resembling a linear time stream and proper causality, so the actual age of any individual is usually a mystery. For example, the two canonically confirmed oldest Space Marines are Kharn the Betrayer and Ahzek Ahriman, both being born during the Unification Wars on Terra, this means they're <em>both</em> over 10,000 years old (although Kharn and fellow Champion of Chaos Lucius the Eternal have both been known to be killed and brought back by their patron).
</li><li> The Immortal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">God-Emperor</a> of Mankind is approximately 50,000 years old, if his backstory is accurate, although he's spent ten thousand of them on life support.
</li><li> The Necrons fought and ultimately lost a war for control of the galaxy long before the dinosaurs died on Terra. While most of them where asleep for their sixty million+ years of self-inflicted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">sealing</a>, some like Praetorians, the Flayed Ones and Szarekh the Silent King were awake the entire time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">The C'Tan</a>, masters of the Necrons, were literally the oldest beings in the universe, being not that much younger than the first stars. <em>Were</em> being the operative term, considering the Necrons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters">Turned Against Their Masters</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">shattered them into pieces</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">The Chaos Gods</a> are pure beings of the Warp, and thus time is literally and utterly meaningless to them. The Great Game, the perennial war between them fight for dominance of everything, has been going on for eternity and will continue for eternity, with none of them ever emerging the true victor. There's also some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">Timey-Wimey Ball</a> with this, as the Warp was calm and uninhabited for much of the setting's history; Slaanesh for example came into being around the year 30,000 and suddenly he'd always been there, and the Emperor was created by early humanity as a counter to birth of the others.
</li><li> The Swarmlord of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts">Tyranids</a> has been around as long as the Tyranid race has, and has more autonomy than any other Tyranid, likely to the point of having a sort of consciousness of its own. Considering that they have attacked the Milky Way from multiple directions, it would follow that they are attacking from different galaxies, and as such have stripped multiple galaxies of all biological matter. Such a process would take eons, making the Swarmlord incredibly old. Seeing as the Swarmlord <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurrectiveImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurrectiveImmortality">is reborn with all of its experiences, memories, and character whenever it is killed</a>, it will continue to exist for as long as the Tyranid race does.

It is from their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PiecesOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PiecesOfGod">spilled and intermingled blood</a> that the et'Ada would emerge.
</li><li> All of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">et'Ada</a>, pre-creation spirits, qualify.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeOfMyths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeOfMyths">Dawn Era</a> came to an end when he and the other pre-creation spirits settled into their roles, with Akatosh specifically creating linear time as a concept.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>
<ul><li> Arceus is heavily implied to be the creator of the Pokemon universe, if not at least the God of Pokemon as it is the original Pokemon that came before all others. A special event in <em>HeartGold</em> and <em>SoulSilver</em>, where Arceus offers the player a choice of three legendary Pokemon (Dialga, Palkia, or Giratina), gives a glimpse of the sheer enormousness of what it has lived through.
</li><li> Dialga, Palkia and Giratina themselves are an example. Dialga's Pokedex entry even states that time itself started to flow when it was born. By extension, the Lake trio (Uxie, Mespirit and Azelf) are also as old.
</li><li> Mew is believed to be the ancestor of all Pokemon, though this probably doesn't apply to the above.
</li><li> Wartortle is said to live 10,000 years. Though not as extreme as Arceus, that's still a <em>long</em> time.
</li><li> Heatran might also be extremely ancient, as it was apparently born from lava that pooled at around the same time that the earth was first formed.
</li><li> It is noted in the Pokedex that Rayquaza has lived in the ozone layer for several hundred million years because it gets its energy from water particles and sunlight in the ozone layer, meaning that it doesn't ever need to go down on solid ground to survive. It is for this reason that its existence went into legend as it hardly ever left the sky. For perspective the reign of the dinosaurs was approximately 200 hundred million years on this Earth, Rayquaza is at the very least slightly over 3 times older than the existence of the dinosaurs.
</li><li> Kyogre and Groudon are mentioned as having produced entire seas and continents. If this is talking about the entire Earth then they are at least 4 billion years old, but if it is talking about the region of Hoenn then it could be at least a few million years. In <em>Emerald</em> the elders who have the orbs that are said to control Kyogre and Groudon don't ever specifically call those two or even Rayquaza by name, only claiming them to be super-ancient Pokemon, which is putting it lightly.
</li><li> Xerneas and Yveltal from X and Y are <em>at least</em> 3000 years old when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar">Great Offscreen War</a> happened. How long they were in existence before that is unknown but they're said to be the embodiments of Life and Death in the Pokéverse.
</li><li> Genesect's Pokedex entry states that it existed 300 million years ago.
</li><li> Eternatus is said to have arrived in Galar from space inside a meteor 20,000 years ago, with it likely being far older than that.
</li><li> Since Zacian and Zamazenta are said to have subdued Eternatus when it caused the Darkest Day in Galar, they're also at least 20,000 years old, long enough for many people to forget they had even existed at all.

Most notable is Eirin, who routinely claims to be infinitely old (relative to everyone else anyway) and was a mentor to some of the gods who took part in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreationMyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreationMyth">Creation Myth</a> of Japan.

And for an even deeper look into the abyss we have the Mishaguji, the serpentine curse and fertility gods that ruled the Suwa region before Suwako arrived and subdued them. Though their exact age and origins are unknown, it is believed that worship of Mishaguji began at some point during the Middle to Late <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jomon_period">Joumon period,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> so probably about 3000-5000 years ago.

She is stated to be one of the most powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">youkai</a> in Gensoukyou by sheer virtue of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongerWithAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongerWithAge">one of, if not its outright oldest resident</a>. In <em>Phantasmagoria of Flower View</em>, several characters are confronted by the local judge of the dead who warns them about the sins that may end up getting them sent to hell once they die.

<ul><li> Loken, a Titan-appointed guardian evokes this trope by explaining that he has held watch over Azeroth for countless millennia and seen the rise and fall of civilisations, the birth and extinction of entire species.
</li><li> Nordrassil, the World Tree, is at least ten thousand years old. So are some dragons and various godlike entities. Many night elves are as well, wether they experience all that time in the physical world or the Emerald Dream, but generally don't have the gravitas you'd expect.
</li><li> Many Draenei remember their homeworld Argus, from where they fled over 25,000 years ago. Since it's implied that they spent much of their trip through the Nether in suspended animation, their exact age is hard to guess...but it's known that they lived on several worlds before ending up in Azeroth, so it'll still add to a very long time. Velen, their leader, is the only one that really looks old, so it could be that he spent less time in suspended animation, or that he was old even when they lived on Argus. The Lords of the Burning Legion, being originally members of the same race, are the same age too (and they've been active for the whole 25 millennia, too).
</li><li> Many Titan-constructed facilities can be found around Azeroth. Depending on the source the Titans either created Azeroth or shaped it into a life-supporting planet. In either case, the buildings are tends of thousands of years old at the very least, possibly several million years old. Some are very intact and still guarded by the Titan's constructs.

Until something "happens", he can also see <em>every possible route time MIGHT take</em>. At one point, he became trapped in time ('how long' is hard to say given the nature of the thing). <em>Every</em> moment of time. At once. Including all the infinite alternate routes. When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thrall</span> finds him, he is awestruck to see his entire life at once played out with a different memory on a different single scale of the dragon's massive form.

He was a historian from before the Sundering who, at the moment of his death, was taken up by the Guardians of Time and given immortality so that he might witness (hence the name) and record all of Azerothian history. Among his duties is comparing his own records against the records of society around him, so he'll know if someone has been messing up the timestream (again.)

This split, that also caused both of them to become slavemasters and genocidal (respectively), happened over 20000 years ago.

He is an automated artificially intelligent probe sent to the Milky Way from the Triangulum Galaxy, though since his creators are long since dead and gone he's not sure what his original purpose was. He finds it amusing that you refer to the Precursors as such (they lived around 200,000 years ago), and mentions having been around long enough to witness the galaxy complete several rotations, which means he's at least several hundreds of millions of years old.

His lore confirmed as such: <em> The being now known as Aurelion Sol was already ancient by the time stellar debris first coalesced into worlds. Born in the first breath of creation, he roamed the vast nothingness, seeking to fill a canvas of incalculable breadth with marvels whose twinkling spectra brought him considerable delight and pride.</em>

The memories are more in the form of a diary the previous incarnation leaves, so there's no emotional connection to them. They are inexperienced with their powers. They are bound by promises their previous incarnation made, however. If an Immortal fails to prepare properly, they may lack information and power.

His current incarnation alone is over 10,000 years old. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">So it any surprise he's so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">insane</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">uncaring</a>, and flat-out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever">sick of it</a>?</span>

<ul><li> Living things:
<ul><li> In a way, life itself is a time abyss. The cells we are made of were split off from our parents' cells, and <em>their</em> cells came from their parents, and so on and so forth, back to the formation of life, 3.8 billion years ago. Gene sequences exist in every one of our cells that have remained unchanged since the earliest common ancestor to all life. The purest example of this is the common amoeba, which splits itself to reproduce rather than dying of old age. It changes over time, and obviously is composed of different individual molecules, but in a very real sense that first amoeba is still alive and wriggling two billion-odd years later. A new branch of SETI, Biological SETI, is currently examining our DNA for traces of messages left for us by aliens, on the assumption that, with its ability to self-replicate and self-repair, DNA is the only substance on which a message could be transcribed that could be preserved for millions, even billions, of years.
</li><li> The oldest known living thing on Earth is a single, giant patch of <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/02/120207152545.htm">''Posidonia Oceanic'' seagrass in the Mediterranean Sea<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Studies show that it is most likely at least 100,000 years old.
</li><li> Many species of plants and microorganisms have extremely long or unlimited lifespans; possibly the most famous example is the bristlecone pine tree, individual specimens of which are presently alive in spite of having sprouted nearly five millennia ago. One of them was found to be 4,844 years old when cut down in 1964. (John Muir once commented that a <em>shorter-lived</em> Sequoia tree was "already centuries old when Jesus walked the Earth.") There are also some trees that live in clonal colonies; the stems are continually renewed while the root system endures. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pando_(tree)">One such colony of Quaking Aspens<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has roots that are at least 80,000 years old.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note944gx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note944gx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note944gx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Unfortunately, Pando is showing signs that it is dying.</span>
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turritopsis_dohrnii">immortal jellyfish<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is another example, using a kind of reverse aging. Hydras have a similar mechanism.
</li><li> The oldest known non-clonal organism is a bristlecone pine which was dendrochronologically dated in 2013 to be 5,067 years old. To put that into perspective, this tree was already about 494 years old when construction of the pyramids of Giza began.

</li><li> Many of the stone circles in Britain fit this trope, being almost/over five thousand years old.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientEgypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientEgypt">Ancient Egypt</a>: Egyptian history from the earliest extensive records in the 31st century BC to the Macedonian Conquest in 332 BCE spans <em>2700 years</em>. Consider this: To <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar">Julius Caesar</a>, the first Pharaohs were <em>1000 years more ancient</em> than either of them is to us; to the builders of the Pantheon in Rome, the Great Pyramid was older than the Pantheon is to the designers of today's skyscrapers. Even the third of the Ancient Egyptian "golden ages" of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties was as far removed from them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLowMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLowMiddleAges">the Early Middle Ages</a> are to us—the world of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RamsesII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RamsesII">Ramses II</a> was as far back for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Augustus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Augustus">Augustus</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Charlemagne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a>.

Almost any trope recorded in Ancient Egypt is therefore by definition <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt">Older Than Dirt</a>.
<ul><li> To clarify: the Pyramid of Giza was constructed in ~2560 BCE, while the Pantheon was constructed in 125 CE (2685 years later)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note107xu1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note107xu1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note107xu1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Incidentally, it also held the record for the tallest man-made structure until Lincoln Cathedral was built in 1311 CE — 3870 years later</span>. Meanwhile, the earliest pharaoh with verified historical evidences was a guy called <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iry-Hor">Iry-Hor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who lived in the 32nd century BCE. That's three millennia older than Julius Caesar, who was born in 100 BCE. And Iry-Hor was certainly ancient by the time Ramses II was born 1800 years later (the late 14th century BCE), who in turn was medieval by the time Augustus was born 1200 years later (27 BCE). Finally, Cleopatra VII was born in 69 BCE, meaning she was 2491 years younger than the Giza pyramid and 2038 years older than the Apollo 11 mission.
<div class="indent"> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Vsauce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Vsauce">Vsauce</a></strong>: <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLdblFQqsw">The Pyramids of Giza were as old to the ancient Romans as the ancient Romans are...to us.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</div></li><li> When the Pyramid of Giza was completed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MammothsMeanIceAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MammothsMeanIceAge">mammoths</a> still existed on Earth (specifically, in <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrangel_Island">Wrangel Island<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a remote Arctic island currently part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Russia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Russia">Russia</a>). In fact, they wouldn't go extinct until around 2000 BCE, a whopping five centuries later.
</li></ul></li><li> If anything human-built counts, some sites (including a few cities surviving to the present day) in the Middle East are leading contenders.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gobekli_Tepe">Göbekli Tepe<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a pre-Neolithic religious complex in Turkey that dates from roughly 9600 BCE and was built by people who had not yet developed metal tools, pottery, the wheel, or agriculture. It is believed that the location's use as a religious centre goes even further back; all the way to 11,000 BCE.
</li><li> The city of Jericho is also a pre-Neolithic settlement first inhabited around 10,000 BCE, and inhabited<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note115gmi');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note115gmi" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note115gmi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">sort of, it was all but abandoned during the latter part of the Bronze Age, including the date when it was supposedly sacked by the Israelites</span> for all 12,000 years. To give an idea, the ice age ended around 10,000 years ago.
</li><li> Damascus was first settled at least 8000 — possibly even 11,000 — years ago during early Neolithic times, and has been in continuous use ever since. It is older than any modern or ancient civilization. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain">Mark Twain</a> referred to it as "a form of immortality."
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of remains made by human beings, the hand axes found in Olduvai, a region in Tanzania, date back 1.8 million years. That is incomprehensible. Not to mention possibly the oldest use of fire by human beings dates back to 1 million years, in a place in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.history.com/news/human-ancestors-tamed-fire-earlier-than-thought">South Africa<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Note however this isn't Homo sapiens, this is Homo erectus or Homo ergaster, an early human species.
</li><li> Ötzi the Iceman could be considered to qualify as this trope, assuming that a dead person can qualify at all. The oldest mostly intact human body ever discovered, he lived and died over five thousand years ago, with the entirity of recorded history, plus a chunk of pre-history, having passed since then. When the first stone was laid for the first pyramid in Giza Ötzi had already been under the ice for about a millennium. When the first pharaoh unified Upper and Lower Egypt, he had already been dead for several centuries!
</li><li> A show about the simple disappearance of all humans predicted that the last traces of human existence would be the man-made objects on the moon (lunar landers, US flag, etc.). Unless some outside force or object intervenes, they would remain on the moon forever. And the only human whose name will be left there (well, on the plaque on the Moon, anyway) is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a>. There's something ironic there.
<ul><li> It was also predicted that if humans disappeared from Earth today, Mount Rushmore would still be intact millions of years later (though many features, especially noses, would've eroded away by then), waiting to be seen by the next intelligent species to evolve.
</li></ul></li><li> Protons. According to one theory, they are ultimately stable, that is, live absolutely forever. According to another, they have a half-life that makes Brahma seem like a mayfly.
<ul><li> Radioactive material, while not lasting forever, can last an <em>incredibly</em> long time. The two commonly found forms of uranium, uranium-235 and uranium-238, have a half-life of 703.8 million years and 4.468 billion years respectively. By the time a kilogram block of uranium-238 ceases to exist, the universe may as well have ended. And there are isotopes with longer half lives than that; bismuth-209 has a half-life of around 19,000,000,000,000,000,000 years (that's well over a billion times the commonly accepted value for the current age of the Universe) and is the current record holder for radioactive isotope with the longest known half-life. (If protons actually do decay, then all elements are "radioactive", but experiments have set a lower limit of <em>at least</em> 59,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years for the half-life of hydrogen-1).
<ul><li> Of course, radioactive material by definition doesn't last anywhere near as long as it would were it not radioactive. Consider protons again.
</li><li> Even after all the material in the Universe has decayed to its final state, the subatomic particles of which matter was once composed last effectively forever. It's recommended to take a look at this <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future">Timeline of the far future<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm">You Cannot Grasp the True Form</a> does not even start to define it: "Although listed in years for convenience, the numbers beyond this point are so vast that their digits would remain unchanged regardless of which conventional units they were listed in, be they nanoseconds or star lifespans."
</li><li> On the same line, the very first moments of the Universe after the Big Bang fall into this trope (see <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_timeline_of_the_Big_Bang">The Other Wiki<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>). While those times from our perspective look tiny and meaningless, not so much if one notes the proportions between those epochs and compares them to the future ages of the Universe<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12ufbj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12ufbj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12ufbj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For example, the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_epoch">Electroweak epoch<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> lasted from 10^-36 or 10^-32 seconds to 10^-12 seconds after the Big Bang. If we equal the 10^-43 seconds the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_era">Planck era<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (the closest we can get to the Big Bang itself with our current knowledge of Physics) lasted to a year, it would have lasted from 10,000,000 or 100,000,000,000 years to <em>10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000</em> (10^31) years after the Big Bang.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Black Holes, once formed won't actually exist forever, as they release energy through a process called Hawking radiation. While the actual time it would take for a Black Hole to fully evaporate though is believed to vary depending on its size, its estimated to be somewhere between 8,6 × 10^70 years (that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">70 zeroes!</a>) to 1,3 × 10^99 years.
</li><li> HD 140283 "Methuselah" is a star initially calculated to be older than the universe, literally older than time. It was later recalculated to be 14.4 billion years old, ±0.8 billion years, which is only slightly better. Even if on the sprightly side of that range, it's very old.
<ul><li> Perhaps surpassed by <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMSS_J031300.36-670839.3">SM0313<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Note that age calculations for very old stars have a large percentage of uncertainty as they are based on theoretical models of stellar evolution, so it's far more likely they formed <em>after</em> the Big Bang and not before it.
</li></ul></li><li> On the same subject, PSR B1620-26 b, aka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">Methuselah</a> is an exoplanet roughly 2.5 times the size of Jupiter, which is believed to have outlived its original star. It's currently in orbit of a binary system consisting of a Neutron star and a white dwarf, the later believed to have once been an sun-like star and the planet's original host before booth was captured by the Neutron star ages ago, said neutron star also preventing the other star from going supernova and destroying the planet when it died. While the actual age of the planet is impossible to tell, its location would imply it was formed around 12.7 billion years ago, making it the oldest exoplanet ever discovered.

</li><li> The non-fiction history book <em>Human Accomplishment</em> by Charles Murray starts with a chapter intended to evoke the Time Abyss, by tracing back human society in 400-year chunks.
