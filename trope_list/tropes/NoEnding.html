<ul><li> This is something of a trademark for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi">Rumiko Takahashi</a> and her longer-running stories, with only her original slice-of-live romantic comedy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaisonIkkoku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaisonIkkoku">Maison Ikkoku</a></em> being exempt.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura">Urusei Yatsura</a></em> does this almost constantly. Many episodes follow this formula: Lum or one of the other aliens introduces a new device or power. One of the other characters misuses it for selfish reasons. Things rapidly spin out of control until the entire town is engulfed in chaos. And... that's it. The episodes often end just when things are at their craziest, without even considering how the cast will get out of this mess.
</li><li> The series itself ends this way, too. The final storyline <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is one big lampshading of the fact that after all these years, Ataru still refuses to tell Lum he loves her. He literally is willing to risk the destruction of the world to avoid doing this. When the townsfolk discover this, they form a mob and hunt Ataru down to try to force him to say he loves Lum. He <em>still</em> won't, and the series ends with him about to be beaten to death.</span>
<ul><li> To be specific, the series doesn't exactly conclude with No Ending, but more of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAdventureContinues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAdventureContinues">"adventure continues"</a> type of ending. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ataru chases after Lum, who refuses to disable an amnesia device (which will make all the aliens forget their memories of Earth) until he tells her he loves her, but she stops when she notices he kept the chunk of her horn he pulled off all the way back in chapter one. It's enough to convince her, but she tells him she'll get him to say it one day. Ataru says he'll say it on his deathbed, and the series ends there, much to the cast's annoyance (someone even tosses a can at Ataru's head in the very last panel)</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> is a two-fer. The anime version was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort">Cut Short</a> and ended with Nodoka's first appearance; the final shot of the episode was Ranma and Akane discussing their need to get going, and waving a farewell to the audience. The manga, meanwhile, got all the way up to an attempted wedding between Ranma and Akane. Which got blown up. The second-last panel of the manga is the two arguing over whose fault it was that the wedding was wrecked, and the last was a shot of them heading off to school again with a caption stating that "the game of love... has gone into overtime".
</li><li> The anime adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em> ends with the heroes running off into the sunset, still having yet to defeat the antagonist, but proudly proclaiming that someday they will. Eventually the show was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled">Un-Canceled</a> to finish out the rest of the series. Though doesn't cover all the manga stories from where the original series left off, just the main conflict with Naraku.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OVA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OVA">OVA</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KujibikiUnbalance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KujibikiUnbalance">Kujibiki Unbalance</a></em> represents episodes 1, 21, and 25 of a fictional 26-episode TV series, meaning that we never get to see the conclusion. Just to heighten the annoyance, episode 25 ends with Ritsuko <em>about</em> to announce the conditions for victory in the tournament. (The manga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Genshiken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Genshiken">Genshiken</a></em>, which featured it as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a>, clarifies that the last episode was never aired due to a typhoon, so it is sort of justified.)
<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Genshiken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Genshiken">Genshiken</a></em> manga itself doesn't really have any real ending, the idea being that just because the members graduate doesn't mean that club is going anywhere. More members will join and life (and doujinshi) will go on.
</li><li> The second season fully embraces this trope, while doing the preview for the final episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NobuyukiHiyama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NobuyukiHiyama">Madarame</a> loudly proclaims: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">YES!</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousJapanese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousJapanese">MIKAN</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">IS</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">BESTO ENDO!!!</a>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/XxxHolic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/XxxHolic">Xxx Holic</a></em>:

</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The whole series apparently ends with Watanuki and Doumeki talking about a dream of Yuuko's. Except that it's Doumeki's <em>grandson</em> and Yuuko's dream is telling Watanuki that he can leave the shop at last. Nothing about the fates of Kohane, Himawari and her husband, the original Doumeki, the unhatched egg that's now a Doumeki family heirloom, and Syaoran is ever resolved.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DaiGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DaiGuard">Dai-Guard</a></em> doesn't end when all the Heterodynes are destroyed, it ends when all the characters realize that the Heterodyne attacks are simply a fact of life in 2030 Japan the same as earthquakes and hurricanes and the point is not about putting an end to them, but how you deal with them. From protecting the lives AND livelihoods of the civilians and working with the military and your allies (rather than against them) to deal with the situation properly.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZatchBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZatchBell">Zatch Bell!</a></em> anime <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding">ends</a> after Gash and company beats Faudo. Kiyomaro and Gash (whose book is still golden) are about to fight Sherry and Brago in a grassy meadow. No outcome is shown and the anime ends there. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The manga took a few cues from the anime near the end, up to the point where the final fight between Gash and Brago is in a grassy meadow. However, expectedly, Gash wins this fight and becomes King of Makai.</span>

</div></li><li> Often a case in comic books, especially when a comic ends abruptly. Occasionally the plotline will be picked up again in another book or resolved if a series is brought back into publication. Trade paperbacks are also infamous for this sometimes, as far as leaving storylines unresolved or ending in the middle. Famous examples would be:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a> Visionaries: Neal Adams</em>, which ends with Xavier collapsing and near death (in part because the subsequent issue, wasn't drawn by Neal Adams).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor">X-Factor</a> Visionaries: Peter David V4</em> leaves an entire storyline dangling (X-Factor going to Genosha, after the US decides to deport a bunch of Genoshan mutates seeking asylum) because David left the storyline after the first issue due to executive meddling. Not to mention reprinting the X-Cutioner's Song storyline tie-in issues.
</li><li> Fans of Jim Lee's X-Men run have suffered this as well, as his last couple of issues of X-Men have never been published, leaving "Mutant Genesis" with major cliff-hangers as far as the Mojo/Longshot storyline.

Granted the latter's omission is due to the fact that that story takes place in Rom (which can't be reprinted due to copyright problems), but the former is just insane.

</li><li> The <em>Hush Returns</em> arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Gotham Knights</a></em> was left completely unresolved, in a sort of bizarre <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MexicanStandoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MexicanStandoff">Mexican Standoff</a> between Batman, Hush, and the Joker armed with a remote-controlled pace maker inside Hush's chest.

Another character suggests she take her time. The ending shows her standing outside the hut where Skywise and the other two girls are making out, but the ending lampshades the ambiguity of whether she joins them or walks away.
</li><li> Happens in the old <em>Advanced Dungeons and Dragons</em> comic. A lich has kidnapped one of the characters because he wanted her as a "wife". Everything was set for a rescue, but the series was dropped, resulting in just one final unconnected special and a new Spelljammer line.

The entire story makes it seem as though there will be some big battle between the title characters at the end, but instead all that happens is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Thor escapes his dungeon, and as Loki begs for mercy, Thor strikes his hammer down</span> and that's it. No epilogue, no resolution, no conclusion. Not a satisfying one anyway, at least not at first. Though one could argue that the abrupt ending is more powerful and tragic, it'd still really frustrating and unsatisfying to the reader at the moment.

After spending a lot of time building up the Peter/Mary Jane hook up, the final scene of the series ends with Peter and Mary Jane reaching to hold each others hands. To everyone's annoyance, the follow-up series (which is not written by Sean McKeever) does not follow up on this and establishes M.J. and Peter are still just friends. They have a nice moment in the final issue sharing a pizza together, though. According to later interviews with <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McKeever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McKeever">Mc Keever</a>, Peter and M.J did indeed become a couple in his version of events and some plans he had for follow-ups would have involved a love triangle with Johnny Storm, but that Peter and M.J would still come out of it as a couple

When the strip was officially cancelled on March 10th, 2010, Annie was in Guatemala with her kidnapper, the terrorist leader the "Butcher of the Balkans". Warbucks has no idea where she is, or even that she's still alive, and the Butcher tells Annie that he neither will let her go nor kill her — for fear of being captured and because he will not kill a child despite his many political killings — and adds that she has a new life now with him. The final panel of the strip reads "And this is where we leave our Annie. For Now" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>However</em> the story restarted with a glimmer of hope in 2013 in another strip, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/DickTracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/DickTracy">Dick Tracy</a></em>, where Warbucks enlisted the detective's help to find her.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCavern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCavern">The Cavern</a></em> infamously did this. Towards the end of the film, the caveman Petr brutally kills one of the remaining survivors and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousRape">rapes</a> the other, and the film just ends right there.
</li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CrossOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CrossOfIron">Cross of Iron</a></em>, Sgt. Steiner and Capt. Stransky are fighting together for survival during the final Soviet assault. When they cross the railroad tracks, Stransky shoots two Soviets, emptying the magazine of his MP-40. He trips and falls, and Steiner shouts at him to get up. Stransky panicking at his empty gun, begs Steiner to tell him how to reload. A Soviet boy soldier shoots at him and knocks of his helmet as Steiner begins to laugh manically. The screen freezes with a shot of Stransky putting his helmet on backwards, then cuts to the boy soldier trying to fire a jammed MP-40 and shaking his head in disgust, and finally to Steiner limping away laughing hysterically. The film ends rather ambiguously with a shot of an explosion and Steiners maniacal laugh continuing into the credits. This abrupt ending was due to budget issues demanding improvisation and rewrite of the final scene.
</li><li> The horror movie <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Creature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Creature">Creature</a></em> infamously not only has no ending but no third act either. The film's climax of the main character fighting the creature is done off-screen and the end credits roll after the second act. Critics called out the director (and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">Small Name, Big Ego</a>) on this and called it a ripoff to release a film that was basically unfinished.

Although we see him raising his stone cudgel angrily, the movie ends before showing us whether he kills his father or his lover.

The Earth is hurtling towards the Sun, but a series of massive nuclear detonations in Siberia may avert the catastrophe. The last scene shows the journalists waiting in the print room with two next editions ready for printing, one saying WORLD SAVED and the other WORLD DOOMED. The American version of the film ends with church bells ringing, implying the world had been saved.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDevilInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDevilInside">The Devil Inside</a></em> infamously did this. The third act is about to start, our protagonists are driving somewhere- SMASH! Car crash. Everyone's dead. A title card appears, reading, "The events of this film have never been fully explained. Visit therossifiles.com for more information on the ongoing investigation." The end. To make matters even worse, the site was taken down and now appears to be some sort of phishing page. Sucks if you bought the movie after the theatrical release.

They stop for gas. He impulsively hitches a ride on a logging truck, abandoning her. Then the movie ends.

Though the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenII1981" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenII1981">sequel</a> <em>does</em> pick up immediately afterwards.

He is able to get all but one of the stations blocked, and the film ends with him screaming "Stop It!" over and over into the phone. We never find out if the signal is indeed stopped, or the fate of all the kids watching that night.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HiroshimaMonAmour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HiroshimaMonAmour">Hiroshima Mon Amour</a></em> is a story of a Japanese man and his French lover, in which she tells him much of her life story, including her doomed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">wartime</a> romance with a German soldier. The woman gets upset while telling the man this story and leaves him for a while. Finally, they meet again in her hotel room. The woman, sitting on the bed in her room, tells the man that his name is Hiroshima. The man tells the woman that her name is Nevers (her home town in France, where she met the soldier). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEnd">The End</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIdesOfMarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIdesOfMarch">The Ides of March</a></em> ends on a scene designed to resonate with the film's message, but cuts it off right before the protagonist answers a specific question. The scene hints at an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">Author's Saving Throw</a> to come, but the film as a whole suggests <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">a stick to the status quo</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IntoTheForest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IntoTheForest">Into the Forest</a></em>: The film ends with the sisters and their newborn camping in the woods, without a home or a clear idea of how they'll survive. There is no indication of whether the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBlackout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBlackout">Big Blackout</a> will ever end.

Croker then says, "Hang on, lads. I've got an idea." Then the film ends before we find out what the idea is, if it works, and if anyone survives, much less gets the gold. This was in deference to the production codes of the time, which still would not allow criminals get happy endings. Rather than show them punished, the film simply lets you imagine what happens. Many theories have been floated around as to exactly how they are supposed to get out of their situation and possible theories as to how the plot would continue.
</li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JasonAndTheArgonauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JasonAndTheArgonauts">Jason and the Argonauts</a></em> Jason has defeated the skeletons and the Argo is about to sail away from Colchis with the Golden Fleece, but even assuming they're not attacked by Thessalian warships they still have to find a way back through the Clashing Rocks, navigate all the way back to Thessaly and kill King Pelias. Zeus says "For Jason there will be other adventures", but they were never filmed. This is probably for the best, because Jason becomes a total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> in the original myth.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JuRei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JuRei">Ju-Rei</a></em>: The movie is shown in chapters presented in reverse order, counting down from "Chapter 10" to "Chapter 1" and finally to a "Prologue." The prologue does not show the origin or cause of the curse, or lend any special significance to the chronologically final chapter (the first one shown), or really resolve anything; it just shows an event that had already been mentioned in an earlier (later?) chapter.Again".

The cult that the movie has been building force the protagonist, Jay, to fight a figure only defined as the Hunchback. After he kills it, it's revealed that the Hunchback was his wife carrying their son on her back. Jay is crowned by the cult (now revealed to be other characters in the movie), and as they applaud and Jay stands over the bodies of his family, the movie ends.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Killersaurus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Killersaurus">Killer/saurus</a></em> ends with Professor Peterson and Kayleigh abandoning the project and starting to flee the facility. Then the screen cuts to black and the credits roll.
</li><li> John Sayles' <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Limbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Limbo">Limbo</a></em> ends with the three main characters on an island, waiting for a plane to come and either rescue them or kill them. Before you find out which, it fades to white. According to John Sayles, ending the movie with either a rescue or a killing wouldn't have felt right.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LockStockAndTwoSmokingBarrels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LockStockAndTwoSmokingBarrels">Lock, Stock &amp; Two Smoking Barrels</a></em>. Tom decides to dispose of the shotguns that are the only evidence of the crime he and the other protagonists have committed. As he prepares to dump them off a bridge into the Thames, his buddies discover that the weapons are rare antiques, each worth a fortune. The movie ends with Tom hanging over the side of the bridge, poised to drop the guns in the river, and his cell phone clutched between his teeth (put there to avoid it falling into the river while he is hanging over the edge) - and it rings.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoneStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoneStar">Lone Star</a></em>, Pilar and Sam learn they're half-siblings after falling in love and consummated their relationship; Pilar says, "Forget the Alamo", hinting that they will continue even though they know they're related.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanStreets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanStreets">Mean Streets</a></em>, Michael, having been pushed too far by Johnny Boy, sets up a drive-by ambush as Johnny, Charlie, and Teresa are driving to Brooklyn. The gunfire from Michael's mook causes Charlie to crash the car. Johnny is shot in the neck and Charlie in the hand, but all three exit the car alive. Then the film ends.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeeksCutoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeeksCutoff">Meeks Cutoff</a></em>: The film ends before we find out whether the pioneers found civilization or where the Native American guide was taking them. As a consequence, the film never says whether the Native American is a villain and never presents the westward expansion of the pioneers as a good or bad thing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MelindaAndMelinda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MelindaAndMelinda">Melinda and Melinda</a></em>. The serious story has no ending.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Monos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Monos">Monos</a></em>: Very little is left resolved in the end. Did Doctora eventually find refuge somewhere? What did the soldiers do with Rambo? What happened to Bigfoot and Boom-Boom after they dove into the river? Did Lady kill those kids? Did Smurf ever escape his bonds? What's to become of the surviving Monos as a group, now that they have dwindled to so few?

Just as Arthur and his newly acquired cavalry are about to storm the final castle, they're all arrested in connection with the murder of a historian that occurred earlier on in the picture, in what audiences would have assumed was just a dopey throwaway joke. There were big plans for this scene- including a full-on war between the French and Arthur's army. Unfortunately, at the end of filming, the budget and time just abruptly ran out and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">they opted for a joke instead in true Python fashion</a>.

The film ends with her having fully embraced the treatment center and being around people who accept her, but it's completely left open whether she is recovering at all or only getting worse.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyline">Skyline</a>,</em> as part of an obvious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a>, but since the movie bombed, it's probably not happening.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSwordOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSwordOfDoom">The Sword of Doom</a></em>, a remarkably grim and nihilistic samurai movie, has the (anti)hero cornered, fighting, probably doomed — and then the film ends in mid-slash on a freeze frame. The reason for this: a sequel was intended but never filmed. (But given the general aura of nihilism in the film, this no-ending actually works better than one more definitive.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTalentedMrRipley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTalentedMrRipley">The Talented Mr. Ripley</a></em>, though the existence of sequels implies that he got away with it.

</li><li> The finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheyMightBeGiants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheyMightBeGiants">They Might Be Giants</a></em> features the hero, who's convinced he is Sherlock Holmes, and his love interest, who just happens to be named Mildred Watson. After escaping from a mental hospital and a climatic fight in a grocery store, the two end up waiting by a tunnel in Central Park at midnight for the infamous (and supposedly fictitious) Moriarty to emerge.

The film stock appears to burn up and the fates of both races and all the characters are left unresolved.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWarpedOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWarpedOnes">The Warped Ones</a></em>. Akira is a street thug who raped and impregnated Fumiko. Yuki is a bar prostitute who had sex with Fumiko's boyfriend Kashiwaga and also got impregnated. Akira takes Yuki to the hospital to get an abortion. There they meet Kashiwaga and Fumiko. Akira pushes Yuki at Kashiwaga, grabs Fumiko, and says they should switch girls, since Fumiko's carrying his baby while Yuki is carrying Kashiwaga's. Akira and Yuki mock Kashiwaga, laughing maniacally. Cue Freeze Frame ending.

Instead of revealing whether the princess has chosen for her lover to marry a stranger or be killed by a tiger, the narrator simply asks the reader what he thinks happened. A popular school assignment is for students to answer the question and write their own ending. Readers were so playfully insistent on getting the official answer out of Stockton that they once tried to trick him into choosing between platters of food shaped like a lady and a tiger. He politely refused.
<ul><li> He later did a lesser-known follow up, The Discourager of Hesitancy. It's essentially the same story with a slightly different twist; instead of two doors that give no clues, there are two women who give different indicators (one smiles, the other frowns) but the hero has no way of knowing which is the "correct" one, or for that matter whether either means anything at all. At the end, the narrator of the story tells his guests that if they can decide which woman was the correct one, he will tell them whether the lady or the tiger came through the door. Cue groans and sighs of resignation from the reader.

<ul><li> Also, the entire series ends on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding">cliffhanger,</a> albeit a kind of tacked-on one.
</li><li> Additionally, in another book, Jake wakes up as an adult in a Yeerk-controlled future.

However, it's never revealed what choice he made at the end of the dream (to either save Cassie or save the world; all we know is that the aliens remark on it being an "interesting choice") and it's also never explained who or what the aliens were.
</li><li> Also, in book 16, the Esplin 9466-secondary's mansion burns down, shortly after Jake and the others threatened to kill him if he ever came out again. What happened to him is never mentioned, and it's purposefully left ambiguous whether it was a random accident, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">Cassie</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Jake</a> himself who did it.

Applegate's subsequent series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Everworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Everworld">Everworld</a></em> also ends on a cliffhanger — Loki has freed Odin from his trap and they, combined with Merlin and the Old Worlders, freed Thor and Baldur from Hel.

The final book is called <em>The End</em>, but it is anything but. While the plot is resolved at its absolute-most-basic, i.e. the fate of the Baudelaires and Count Olaf and who Beatrice was, the numerous questions and plot threads accumulated over the course of the series are pointedly dropped as part of an unconventional "you can never have all the answers" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop">Aesop</a>. The story also ends with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Baudelaires sailing away from the island with Kit Snicket's daughter.</span> Understandably, many readers were frustrated.
</li><li> Daphne du Maurier's short story "The Birds", the basis for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirds">the Hitchcock film</a>, ends abruptly with no suggestion as to how the plot might proceed from there, as the protagonist throws the pack of cigarettes he's just finished into the fireplace and watches it burn.

<ul><li> Many years later, he did an updated version which says what happened (basically, Westley's crew ambushes Humperdinck's men, the heroes manage to reach his ship and escape, and a "blood clogger" saves Inigo's life). But then he adds some future snippets, specifically after Westley and Buttercup's child is born. To make a long story short, a bitter rival of Westley's kidnaps the baby, Fezzik confronts him, and the rival tosses the hapless girl off a cliff. Fezzik leaps after her...aaaand, that's it. Not a word since.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a>:
<ul><li> The novella <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMist">The Mist</a></em> "ends" on a very ambiguous note, with the surviving protagonists driving off to...

The King-approved movie version has a very definitive, very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelTwistEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelTwistEnding">Cruel Twist Ending</a>. Watch at your own risk.
</li><li> King's also used this kind of ending in several of his works, but the ones that pop to mind immediately are "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DifferentSeasons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DifferentSeasons">Different Seasons</a></em> (which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShawshankRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShawshankRedemption">the movie</a> gave a definite ending to) and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PetSematary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PetSematary">Pet Sematary</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cell">Cell</a></em> also lacks any definite resolution, ending with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Clay dialing 911 on the cell phone he has, then holding it up to his semi-phoner son's ear</span>.
</li><li> This was a very common complaint about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWasteLands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWasteLands">third book</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower">The Dark Tower</a></em>.

It was nearly the victim of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, as Geisel was pressured to change the ending to a happy one by his publishers. It is appropriate to the story as a parable about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a>, since <em>it</em>, quite thankfully, ended without a definitive resolution.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarAndPeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarAndPeace">War and Peace</a></em> ends right as political unrest is beginning to swell in 1820, and one of the deceased main characters' sons has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicDreamsForEveryone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicDreamsForEveryone">an ominous dream</a> about taking part in a revolution. It's implied that this revolution divides all the main characters into two camps who will have to fight each other.

The epilogue is set <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">many years</a> after Gilead has collapsed, with the main story revealed to be a record she left on audio tape. It notes that (in-universe) historians consider "the Handmaid's Tale" to be a valuable resource, but don't know much more about her than we do.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIlluminatusTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIlluminatusTrilogy">The Illuminatus! Trilogy</a></em> ends with the main characters, menaced by a giant undersea monster, deciding to retire from the bridge of their submarine and discuss the literary symbolism of said sea creature. The story then switches perspective to an obscure character who has only been mentioned a handful of times in the entire series, who proceeds to die in an earthquake. The End.
</li><li> Marianne de Pierres' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParrishPlessis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParrishPlessis">Parrish Plessis</a></em> series ends suddenly and abruptly when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the titular character commits suicide rather than succumb to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">The Corruption</a></span>. Since Parrish is a first-person narrator, we don't find out the resolution to any of the plot threads that she doesn't. If she never sees a character again, then neither do we, no matter how important that character was.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FinnegansWake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FinnegansWake">Finnegans Wake</a></em> by James Joyce deconstructs all aspects of novel and language, and also lacks an ending.

A way a lone a last a loved a long the"
</li><li> Paul Auster's <em>City of Glass</em> also ends abruptly, because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the narrative is a reconstruction of events based on Daniel Quinn's notebook, and ends when he runs out of room to write. A short epilogue states that Quinn was never found, and lays a lot of the blame on Auster</span>. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">that kind of book</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StuartLittle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StuartLittle">Stuart Little</a></em> ends with zero resolution; Stuart simply affirms his determination to find his friend, roll proverbial credits. Apparently author E.B. White was concerned about his health, and decided to end the book at the best place he could find rather than keep going with it and risk leaving it unfinished at an even less satisfying point. However, even after he recovered and lived another 40 years, he never went back to finish the book.
</li><li> Pretty much anything written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NealStephenson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NealStephenson">Neal Stephenson</a> is liable to end with the suddenness of a deliverator ploughing into a brick wall. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowCrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowCrash">Snow Crash</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBaroqueCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBaroqueCycle">The Baroque Cycle</a></em> both manage to pull this off well, ending in an emotionally satisfying way while still leaving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">many plot points unresolved</a>. Done not so well in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDiamondAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDiamondAge">The Diamond Age</a></em>, which could probably have used another hundred pages or so to treat more fully with all of the characters. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cryptonomicon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cryptonomicon">Cryptonomicon</a></em> does have a suitably epic ending, it's just that by that point, the POV character has lost interest, resulting in a highly condensed treatment of the book's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, boiling a month's worth of events into five pages of text.
<ul><li> Taken to the other extreme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/REAMDE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/REAMDE">REAMDE</a></em> (Stephenson's caps), where the culminating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WackyRaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WackyRaces">chase</a> after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">big bad</a> goes on for 300 pages. The thing is though, by the time this happens, the initial premise that gives the book its name (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an ingenious scam using an MMORPG video game as its vehicle</span>) has been abandoned by the author and we never get know how it ends. A bit of a twist on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle">Artifact Title</a>.

They progress through several bizarre realms and realize that each is a representation of the universe itself going through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveStagesOfGrief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveStagesOfGrief">Kubler-Ross stages of grief.</a> In the end, they accomplish basically nothing and stare down the actual vortex sucking the universe, literally, down the drain. Q, at this point, desperate for options and knowing that absolutely none exist, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> manifests a literal message-in-a-bottle in his hands, containing a copy of the book, declares that he is Loki himself and that the universe isn't <em>allowed</em> to end until he says so before throwing the bottle in.</span> The book cuts off mid-sentence, and the following pages are absolutely blank <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> until, finally, the word "heh" starts appearing in the middle of each page. Normal text soon resumes; the bottle washes up on a beach where a young woman, shown in the novel's beginning to be the being responsible for the end, remembers briefly meeting Q by chance while reading it. The fact that Q, of all people, has learned even before the end of the universe to value life and living, is enough to convince her that the universe should continue, and she undoes the end.</span>

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PiersAnthony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PiersAnthony">Piers Anthony</a>'s <em>Mute</em> was supposed to be the beginning of a series.

Footnotes explain that the rest of the account was never found. Since the main narrative (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beowulf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beowulf">Beowulf</a></em> in the 10th century) had already concluded at that point, not many readers complained.

Fortunately, Adams got much better at writing endings for the later books. The story goes that when writing that book Adams, who had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip">legendary ability to miss deadlines</a>, was sufficiently late that the publisher just told him "look, finish up the page you're on and we'll send someone to get it in an hour."
<ul><li> In-universe, Arthur reads a Bartledanian novel wherein the main character dies of thirst in the penultimate chapter because of a plumbing issue briefly mentioned in chapter two. The rest of the book talks about road mending until it ends at precisely one hundred thousand words, which is how long novels are on Bartledan.

</li><li> One of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ScaryStoriesToTellInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ScaryStoriesToTellInTheDark">Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</a></em> collections features the urban legend of the medical students who pull the prank on one of their peers by cutting a hand from a cadaver and tying it to the pull string of the light in her room. The ending was apparently deemed inappropriate for children, so the story ends with the prankster returning and discovering the girl sitting on the floor of her closet and muttering to herself, apparently driven mad. The narration: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyPrank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyPrank">The joke had worked. But no one was laughing.</a>" End of text. For the curious, the usual ending to this story is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the students break into her room and discover she has been driven mad and started to <em>eat</em> the arm.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers">Starship Troopers</a></em> ends with Rico successfully completing his second crack at Officer Candidate School and taking command of the Roughnecks. What happens from there, including the outcome of the war, isn't shown, mostly due to it being more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOfAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOfAge">Coming of Age</a> story if anything.

</li><li> In <em>The Remembering</em>, Steve Cash's third book of The Meq trilogy, most of the characters "cross over" and finally start to age after centuries of immortality in childlike bodies. The previously immortal characters grow up and start having kids. However, questions that remained unanswered throughout the entire series are never explained or resolved, such as the mystery of what the Meq are, where they came from, why they were semi-immortal and possessed strange powers, what their purpose is on Earth in relation to humans, etc. The third book keeps hinting at the resolution of all these questions right up to the end, but they are never answered and by then the characters don't even seem too curious anymore about their origins.

The boy imagines what wondrous things might be inside the box. He searches the box for a keyhole, finally finds it, and inserts the key... but the reader will have to wait for him to turn the key before finding out what's in the box. End. What's more, it's generally put at the very end of the brothers' collection; many scholars think that this was a purposeful choice, indicating that folklore itself always leaves something more to discover.
</li><li> One of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonScottCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonScottCard">Orson Scott Card</a>'s earliest novels, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HartsHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HartsHope">Hart's Hope</a></em>, is entirely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpistolaryNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpistolaryNovel">epistolary</a>, explaining the adventures of main character Orem and his efforts to defeat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. However, by doing so, Orem temporarily usurped the rightful king, and the novel is <em>to</em> that king from his wife, begging him (the king) not to execute Orem for treason. The final lines are her asking him what he decided.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLodgeWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLodgeWriter">David Lodge</a>'s novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChangingPlaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChangingPlaces">Changing Places</a></em> has a deeply lamp-shaded No Ending in which the characters (two of whom are professors of literature so it makes sense) discuss the idea of endings and point out that a film can suddenly end with no warning while a book can't, since the reader can see how many pages remain.
</li><li> Zadie Smith's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhiteTeeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhiteTeeth">White Teeth</a></em> ends with the author proposing several endings that various demographics might find appealing, but without endorsing any of them. Why yes, it's postmodern.

</li><li> Nadine Gordimer's works often end this way. <em>The Late Bourgeois World</em> has the main character still considering her dilemma. <em>July's People</em>, in which the apartheid government collapses amid violence, switches from past tense to present for the short last chapter, in which the main female protagonist is running towards a helicopter that contains either "saviors or murderers".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGrapesOfWrath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGrapesOfWrath">The Grapes of Wrath</a></em> doesn't end so much as run out of pages, with Rose of Sharon breastfeeding a sick man, some of the Joads gone from the group or dead, and the rest just weathering the storm.
</li><li> Ouida Sebestyen's The Girl in the Box is a story of a girl who is abducted and left in a dark cellar, with only a typewriter to entertain her, and regular rations of stale food and water to keep her alive. The book ends with the girl still in the box, and her ultimate fate is never revealed.

</li><li> Mary Brown's <em>Master of Many Treasures</em> ends with the heroine being very badly injured. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantEpilogue">Distant Epilogue</a> describes two stories told about the aftermath, one where she dies and one where she recovers and lives a long life with the hero. A sequel set many years later, <em>Dragonne's Eg</em>, deliberately does not clarify the outcome.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dhalgren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dhalgren">Dhalgren</a></em> ends in the middle of a sentence. It <em>starts</em> in the middle of a sentence as well, and grafting the two together Ouroboros-fashion results in a sentence that makes sense grammatically. How much sense it makes in any other way is considerably more ambiguous.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nova">Nova</a></em>, which is loosely based on the search for the Holy Grail, tells us how many writers have died before finishing tales of the Grail, and then deliberately omits the very last word of the book.
</li></ul></li><li> Robert Musil's epic novel <em>The Man Without Qualities.</em> Musil couldn't figure out how to conclude the final volume.
</li><li> Alex Scarrow's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Timeriders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Timeriders">Timeriders</a></em> series ended with half the main characters in the middle of trying to save the human race, and other half deciding whether to join them.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nutshell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nutshell">Nutshell</a></em> ends with the woman giving birth to her unborn child while she and her lover <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">are in the middle of packing their bags to flee from the police</span>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNeverendingStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNeverendingStory">The Neverending Story</a></em> purposefully leaves almost all subplots  such as what happened to the four messengers, Cairon's fate after meeting Atreyu, the adventures of Hero Hyrneck, what became of Ghemmal and of Sikanda  hanging. Hence the title. However, Bastian's main plot is resolved.
</li><li> Lampshaded to make a point in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VergeStories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VergeStories">"The Pull"</a>. The story stops before we learn the fate of the characters because, ultimately, their survival should not be reassuring when countless others like them are still in peril.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WithoutATrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WithoutATrace">Without a Trace</a></em> episode, "Two Families", the protagonists were fighting to save the life of someone on death row with new-found evidence (somehow missed in the previous 10 years). The characters spend time talking about the morality of Death Row, while doing their best to uncover what really happened. They find evidence that exonerates the character, and now must race against the clock to work the legal system. Show ends with the clock saying 11:57, and a closeup on a non-ringing phone. Cut to credits.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WithoutATrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WithoutATrace">Without a Trace</a></em> did this again with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingWhiteWomanSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingWhiteWomanSyndrome">Missing White Woman Syndrome</a> episode, White Balance." The team investigates the unrelated disappearances of two teenagers, a white female and an African-American male. They are both found: "One alive, one dead." Roll credits.

On the first airing, viewers were invited to vote on the outcome, but the show has not revisited the subject. (For the record, the poll results showed 20% believed it was rape, 60% believed it was consensual, and 20% felt more information was needed.)
</li><li> Another from the season eleven episode "Savior." A young prostitute goes into premature labor and her baby is put on life support. The mother then runs away, giving power of attorney to Olivia, effectively giving Olivia the choice of whether the baby lives or dies. The episode ends with the baby needing immediate brain surgery and the doctors hammering Olivia for a decision that she never gives. Neither the mother nor the baby are ever mentioned again.
</li><li> In "Infiltrated", a side plot deals with a rape case that it looks like the victim is going to lose because Olivia, the arresting officer, is busy working on an undercover investigation for the FBI. Once Olivia finds out about the trial and makes it to the courtroom ready to testify, the episode ends with no conclusion to how the trial turned out.
</li><li> In "Info Wars", a conservative speaker is beaten and raped at a campus rally after an angry mob chases her off the stage, and the detectives narrow it down to two suspects on opposite sides of the political spectrum; an Antifa member who was carrying the sign she was sexually assaulted with and whose DNA was under her fingernails, and a Neo-Nazi who she rejected the night before. Barba dismisses the indictment against the Antifa member due to the jurors' political biases making a fair trial impossible, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation">and the episode ends without anyone knowing for sure which one really did it</a>.

The final episode ended with Sipowicz alone in his office, not because everyone had abandoned him, but because he was <em>still working</em>. The creator did this deliberately to show that no matter how far you grow as a person, there's always tomorrow, and today is just another day. About the only probable conclusion it has is Sipowicz serving as a better boss than what would have been his hardass replacement.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers">Cheers</a></em> ends more-or-less the way it began, with Sam Malone closing up the bar at the end of the day, turning out the lights, and going home.

<ul><li> There <em>almost</em> was a definite ending: Sam had made the difficult decision to start a new life with Diane, and he even got on the plane with her. But they got second thoughts...Sam because it's an uncertain, scary future, Diane because she only accepted Sam back out of desperation and really could do a lot better than him...and when the plane <em>conveniently</em> needed to return to the terminal, Sam got off and they parted ways forever.

Who the gravedigger is and whether he was ever caught is not addressed. This was eventually followed up, but not for another two seasons, making it seem like a classic No Ending for quite some time.

But just as she's taking off, it occurs to her, and the audience, that they might have lied to get her out of the way. And then the audio ends. Just like that.

At the end, the camera zooms away, with Will saying "Seriously, how are we going to get out of here?" The next episode implies they got out, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery">the event is not explained or even mentioned</a>.

They are supposed to wait for the ambulances but in that neighbourhood ambulances can take hours to arrive so they take the boy to the hospital themselves. They are suspended, get sued and become a bargaining chip in the politics between the police department, city hall and the police union. At the end Frank Leo (the protagonist head of the union) saves them and they are in the clear. However, the episode ends with them back in the same apartment with the boy's mother ODing and the cops asking Frank what they should do
</li><li> A few episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AreYouBeingServed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AreYouBeingServed">Are You Being Served?</a></em> have ended this way. One in particular is "The Hold-Up". A couple of burglars have broken into the store and taken Miss Brahms prisoner. Cpt. Peacock and Mr. Spooner pretend to be policemen to rescue her, but are taken prisoner themselves, and Mrs. Slocombe, Mr. Humphries, and Mr. Harman pretend to be gangsters to trick the burglars. At the end of the episode, Mr. Rumbold shows up with some policemen, pretends he doesn't recognize Mrs. Slocombe and Mr. Harman, and they are arrested. Then the burglars show up, and act threateningly towards Mr. Rumbold, and the episode ends there.
</li><li> Brazil has an unusual version of it for its imported <em>Tokusatsu</em> shows. It's not that the shows themselves weren't finished; however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">the company</a> that was showing them had a 'no ending' rule set up, so that the final episode would never be shown, in order to keep the fans wanting to find out what happened. Sometimes the companies just didn't had the final episode because they ordered the tapes up to a certain quantity of episodes, so if the series had 41 episodes, they would get 40 and the last one would get stuck there.

Lather, rinse and repeat, until the show gets replaced with another show.

The makers had actually shot three different endings: one where Benson wins, one where Gatling wins, and one where the third candidate wins. However, test audiences didn't like any of them, so the show ends before the result is announced.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DadsArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DadsArmy">Dad's Army</a></em> begins with Pike getting his head stuck in a gate...and ends with his head still stuck in the gate.

Walker has just sent an international assassin nicknamed "The Viper" tumbling out of a stadium, keeping him from trying to kill the president attending a football game in Dallas. Walker is about to question his involvement in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoShotJFK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoShotJFK">the J.F.K. assassination</a>, but the Viper immediately tells him that if the truth were revealed, Walker wouldn't live to see Monday. Out of spite, he finally agrees- but gets only two words out when a bullet rockets into his chest and kills him instantly, shot by another sniper in some unknown area of the vast stadium. Walker has no idea where the shot came from, as he heard only a sharp echo resonate through the walls, and it was drowned out by sounds of cheering crowds, meaning Trivette, the security guards, and Secret Service alike couldn't hear the gun go off, letting the culprit slip away virtually unnoticed. Walker never finds the second assassin, as the episode closes out respectively to the way we see Kennedy's murder in real life - riddled with conspiracy theories, and the actual truth behind it never made clear.
</li><li> The children's TV show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Aquila" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Aquila">Aquila</a></em> ended on the second season. after introducing us to a brand new character, the boy's falling out over Jeff's new girlfriend and the last thing they show the viewer is the characters finding a cloaked battle-cruiser in orbit. It was based of a book series and 10 years later the author did release a new book but it just ignored the battle-cruiser cliffhanger.

One of the most famous of these was actually an accident. The episode "The Parking Garage" focuses on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters">Main Characters</a> wandering around a parking garage, trying to find their car so they can go home. In the original script, the episode ends with them finding the car and just driving away. However, during shooting, the car being used for the scene wouldn't start, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn">so the episode ends with the characters trying and failing to start the engine, still stuck in the parking garage</a>.

Infamously viewership hated Jenny is found dead at Bette and Tina's house during a party, which kicks off the season after an inexplicable scene-for-scene rewind of the last few minutes of the previous season. The remainder of the season ostensibly pivots around the Jenny's murder whodunnit, with slightly larger-than-average arcs for most of the other characters. The show ends with an insanely stylized walk of the cast to the police station to give their statements about Jenny's death. As far as show-only content, THAT'S where the series ends! The whole season's overarching plotline (and to which most every plotline was party to) never even slightly resolved. Showtime released character testimonies weekly to drum up interest, but most of them were a little sparse in terms of details. Series creator Ilene Chaiken planned a spin-off called The Farm where Alice was found guilty of murdering Jenny (with no word on her actual guilt or innocence) and would revolve around Alice serving time. She pitched it to Showtime initially and then other distributors, but no one picked it up, so the end will forever be oddly abrupt, even assuming that Alice either did murder Jenny.
<ul><li> However, the sequel series <em>The L Word: Generation Q</em> has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Bette revealing that Jenny committed suicide, thus negating the whole arc.</span>

There was a second season in the makings, called <em>Mystic Knights Battle Thunder</em>, in which these plot points would be addressed, but since Power Rangers was starting to regain popularity, all budget that would be used for the new Mystic Knights season was transferred to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLostGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLostGalaxy">Power Rangers Lost Galaxy</a></em>, essentially cancelling Mystic Knights.

There was also a plot where a nerdy teenager, and his popular girlfriend found and adopted a baby sea monster, and were raising it as their pet. In the final episode, the four of them ended up together as the sea levels rose dramatically, separated from their respective families. As they managed to find safety on the top floor of a building, they watch a news reporter get swallowed whole by a sea monster. How they managed to ultimately survive, how the world would react to the planet being ruled by giant monsters, and what would become of the pet was supposed to be covered beginning in the second season.

Based on comments from Thom Yorke, most of the album signifies a nightmare, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">"A Wolf at the Door"</a> is the horror of waking up only to find that while you slept, the world has become just as bad as the nightmare.

Listeners and reviewers at the time were divided on what it was supposed to mean, with some opining that Tommy's followers kill him and others believing he reverts back to his self-imposed deaf-blindness. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> and the Broadway musical clarify it somewhat, but take two completely different takes on it.
</li><li> The Who's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Quadrophenia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Quadrophenia">Quadrophenia</a></em> ends with the singer trapped on a rock in the middle of the ocean. He yields himself to love and reconciles his inner nature, or something, but he's still trapped on a rock in the ocean. Then it ends.

However, after those are both sort-of resolved, halfway through the reprise of the title song, we're treated to a <em>third</em> possibility which, if it was real, would mean that neither of those endings could have happened, and absolutely nothing is resolved, or indeed, actually happened at all.

</li></ul></li><li> Bal-Sagoth tell a lot of original stories in their songs. Many of them end in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeContinued" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeContinued">To Be Continued</a>.
</li><li> In a melodic, rather than plot-based, example, a few of P.D.Q. Bach's pieces end just short of the note you <em>know</em> they have to resolve to, such as the Adagio Saccharino from the Schleptet in E Flat Major (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe747rB3OLg&amp;feature=related">5:40-6:25<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), or the theme from the Tema con Variazione in the Concerto for Horn and Hardart (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-9SbS2DtO0">8:17-9:30<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>).
<ul><li> One of the funnier examples is the "Prelude to <em>Einstein on the Fritz</em>," which, if you listen closely, is a adaptation of the Prelude in C Major from Book One of the <em>Well-Tempered Clavier</em>, which stops short <em>just</em> before reaching the final chord of J.S. Bach's original piece.
</li></ul></li><li> "Untitled" by D'Angelo ends like this in the album version, where the song is cut off mid-sentence.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> did this with both sides of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AbbeyRoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AbbeyRoad">Abbey Road</a></em> album.
<ul><li> "I Want You (She's So Heavy)" has a lengthy musical outro which abruptly cuts to dead silence in the middle of a riff.
</li><li> "Her Majesty", the last track on the second side, cuts out the last note. The reason for this is that "Her Majesty" was originally supposed to be a part of the medley, between "Mean Mr. Mustard" and "Polythene Pam". Listen to it in that order and it makes perfect sense musically. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note563m2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note563m2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note563m2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The final note for "Her Majesty" was restored in <em>The Beatles: Rock Band</em>.</span>

<ul><li> "Harold the Barrel" ends with the titular anti-hero stuck on a window ledge above a town square full of people, preparing to jump, and we're not given any clue how the scene is resolved. Except for the way the final "running jump" fades as if the singer is falling away from the listener.
</li><li> "One for the Vine" is effectively a Möbius-loop song with a never-ending plot; a people who live in mountainous terrain, beset with enemies, have found a saviour-figure to lead them in battle. One of those who don't believe in this hero escapes up the mountain, only to slip and fall onto a plain like the one he calls home, complete with a tribe just like his... who, because of his "miraculous" appearance, hail him as their saviour. At first elated at having landed on his feet (figuratively and literally), he becomes horrified when he realises that he's back in the situation from which he was trying to escape  this time right in the middle. The song (but not the story) ends with him seeing one of his disciples who's lost faith in him flee up a mountain...
</li><li> The concept double-album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheLambLiesDownOnBroadway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheLambLiesDownOnBroadway">The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway</a></em>: since it's based on Peter Gabriel's own dreams, it goes without saying that the narrative is odd, to say the least. Basically, a New York street punk named Rael winds up in some bizarre, alternate underground New York City. After going through many increasingly bizarre locales and situations, he finally sees a way back to the real New York. But he's forced to choose between escape and saving his drowning brother John, who in all previous appearances had refused to save him. Rael dives into the water, rescues his brother, pulls him onto dry land, and then, according to the lyrics, "Something's changed, that's not your face! It's mine, it's mine!" And, um, that's it.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilYoung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilYoung">Neil Young</a> classic "Cortez The Killer" becomes a lengthy jam session that fades out abruptly as the band still plays, due to a power outage that led to the rest of the song, as well as a final verse (much of which is still unknown), being lost. When informed of the power failure, Young said, "I never liked that verse anyway", and used the incomplete take.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a>'s "Space Oddity" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SpaceOddity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SpaceOddity">Space Oddity</a></em>, last thing we know is they lose communication, no clue is left as to what happens after that. "Ashes to Ashes" later reveals that he may have survived.
<ul><li> Peter Schilling's take on the same story in "Major Tom" assumes that he <em>did</em> survive after losing contact, although it's not clear what happens next.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/UtadaHikaru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/UtadaHikaru">Utada Hikaru</a> has the song "Take 5", where the very abrupt ending is supposed to symbolise either death or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">Ascend to a Higher Plane of Existence</a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FranzSchubert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FranzSchubert">Franz Schubert</a>'s infamous "Unfinished Symphony" No. 8 is probably the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker">Trope Maker</a> in the genre.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WolfgangAmadeusMozart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WolfgangAmadeusMozart">Mozart's</a> famous Requiem <em>was</em> this trope, until his student Franz Süssmayr completed it after Mozart's death.
</li><li> Death Cab for Cutie's "Pity and Fear" builds up into a huge, climactic, distorted repeating riff, and then cuts out halfway into a riff. Apparently, whatever they were using to record the song broke in the middle of the recording, and they just ended up keeping it because it sounded better.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohannSebastianBach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohannSebastianBach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a>'s <em>Art of Fugue</em>, the largest and presumably last fugue in the cycle abruptly cuts off mid-passage, as a result of the piece being unfinished <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">before he died.</a>
</li><li> Alexander Scriabin's late works often seem to vanish into thin air rather than reaching a conventional ending. This is particularly noticeable in his Piano Sonata No. 5 (and in most of the rest of the piano sonatas after it).
</li><li> This is also a common feature of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FranzLiszt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FranzLiszt">Franz Liszt</a>'s experimental works from near the end of his life, such as <em>Nuages gris</em> and the various <em>La lugubre gondola</em> pieces.
</li><li> The second movement of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CharlesIves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CharlesIves">Charles Ives</a>'s Fourth Symphony ends in a bombastic circus march section, which cuts off in mid-phrase, leaving only a viola line, which trails off after a measure. In his posthumous piano piece <em>The Celestial Railroad</em>, which is essentially the same symphony movement in a condensed form with fewer sections, the ending is even more abrupt.
<ul><li> Although the endings occur more naturally than the above, his Concord Sonata is notable for its various non-resolutions: the second movement ("Hawthorne") has a shocking burst of dissonant notes, while the first ("Emerson") and last ("Thoreau") seem to fade into infinity at the lowest dynamics possible. By contrast the third movement, "The Alcotts", ends on a more conventional C major.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cunninlynguists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cunninlynguists">Cunninlynguists</a>' "Falling Down" begins with one singer describing his situation, then going through a mental breakdown and shooting a man. As he heads to the pawn shop to buy more ammunition and "take care of some business," another singer takes over, who due to different circumstances also goes through a breakdown and also winds up headed to the pawn shop with blood on his hands. The third singer's rampage, and the song, end with a declaration that two guys who happen to be walking to the pawn shop are "about to get it too." One can only assume that this will not end well.
</li><li> "Itsy-Bitsy Teeny-Weeny Yellow Polka-Dot Bikini".
</li><li> Smokie's song <em>Living Next Door To Alice</em>. In the final verse the narrator's other friend Sally tells him that she has been waiting 24 years for him to take an interest in her. His reply is not recorded, as we are just told that the big limousine disappeared.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello">Elvis Costello</a>'s "Night Rally", which cuts off a noisy buildup and a repeating of the title. Some versions of <em>This Year's Model</em> pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">Mood Whiplash</a> by putting Costello's upbeat single "Radio Radio" immediately afterwards.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeepPurple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeepPurple">Deep Purple</a>'s "Smoke on the Water" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MachineHeadAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MachineHeadAlbum">Machine Head</a></em> could easily be mistaken for having this kind of ending, as many radio stations only play it up to the second verse, which leaves the story hanging.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Vocaloid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Vocaloid">Vocaloid</a> song series Karakuri Burst has a really confusing one. The song ends when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriendRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriendRomance">Rin and Len remember their past</a>, and they both stare at each otherand then it ends.

And the last song just ends with Rin telling Len 'good night until you wake up from this bad dream'. What does it mean? Who are the other characters? Why do Lily and Gumi appear on the cover of the album? Will Rin and Len ever get closure? It won't ever be addressed.

The ending of <em>Shouso Strip</em> does almost the exact opposite: it starts to fade out, but suddenly cuts off before it fades completely. Incidentally, both of these end their respective albums at very precise lengths: <em>KSK</em> at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourIsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourIsDeath">44:44.4</a>, and <em>Shouso Strip</em> at 55:55.

<ul><li> The Egyptian myth of "The Doomed Prince", dating back to the 18th Dynasty, written in hieratic text, probably had an ending originally, but it may never be known, as the scroll with that part was destroyed before the rest could be deciphered. The story is one where the King of Egypt prays for a son, as his wife seems barren; the gods grant his wish, and his wife finally bears him a son. However, the day the prince is born, he is visited by the goddess Hathor at birth in her guise as the Fates, who prophesies that he will die by a snake, crocodile, or dog. After living a sheltered, lonely life due to his father who tries to protect him, the prince finds out about the prophecy, and decides he'd rather face it with dignity. He later wins the love of a princess, and with her help is able to kill a snake that attacks him in his sleep. Then, however, the dog he raised from a puppy attacks him, and he flees, only to be ambushed by a crocodile — who offers to spare him in exchange for his help in a fight against a water demon. This, however, is where it breaks off. (Most scholars believe it probably had a happy ending with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">Screw Destiny</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist">Prophecy Twist</a> theme somewhere at the end, with the hero and the princess living <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter">Happily Ever After</a>.)

Cynics in the development team might likewise figure it's unlikely anyone will have the attention span to play the game all the way through, so the ending isn't really worth devoting much time or effort to.

<ul><li> There are two subtle indicators of your success, the red and blue books being destroyed (although you don't learn Sirrus and Achenar's true fate until <em>much</em> later) and the music when you quit the game being softer and more cheerful. Nonetheless, there's no actual indication that you leave the Ages of Myst. Furthermore, at the start of the second game, Riven, it's <em>very</em> strongly implied that you never left.

After smashing the last boss, Robo Manus, someone, presumably the Dark Queen, hisses "I'll be back!" The heroes crash-land on a lifeless planet and use their portable transporters to instantly zap back to base. Mission accomplished! Meanwhile, the Dark Queen is still alive and plotting, the heroes are still stuck in the forms of overgrown amphibians, and Volkmire is still lurking around somewhere. Issues which will never be resolved, as Rare never produced another Battletoads game.

Ah, sweet, sweet victory....
</li><li> A wretched ZX Spectrum example is <em>Kraal</em>, where completing the last level loops you back to the start of the game - you don't even get to keep your hard-won points.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CursedCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CursedCrusade">Cursed Crusade</a></em> ended with Denz and Esteban searching for Denz's dad in Egypt, with the main antagonist still at large and caught up with Denz's dad to steal the last holy relic. Kind of a letdown unless the developers are planning for a sequel...

After defeating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">The Shadow King</a>, you... kept on playing. You could explore a bit, look around all the various maps, etc. If you'd already defeated all the monsters, there was nothing else to do. And if you quit the game, you were called a coward and a knave — even if you'd already defeated the Shadow King!

How exactly the latter part happened after Zoe destroyed Eingana, whether April really died, and what fate awaits Kian is left open. However the sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DreamfallChapters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DreamfallChapters">Dreamfall Chapters</a></em> continued the story right where it left off and resolved all of the major plot threads.
</li><li> The arcade version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shinobi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shinobi">Shinobi</a></em> actually had an ending, which for some reason was not carried over to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem">Sega Master System</a> adaptation. Instead, the player is awarded with a blank <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> screen after defeating the final boss, the same screen the game gives when the player loses all of his lives.
</li><li> Quite a few of the alternate endings in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em> count as this. A couple are basically just glorified credits reels, one has Marle and Lucca <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">Breaking the Fourth Wall</a> and commenting on some NPCs, and the most famous one of them all dumps Crono into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersRoom">Developer's Room</a>.
<ul><li> The DS-exclusive ending that happens after the party fights the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dream Devourerer</span> also cuts short right after the fight, with the final battle against Lavos never being shown.
</li></ul></li><li> The normal ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross">Chrono Cross</a></em> treats you to a brief animation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> final boss escaping through a portal, then a title card saying 'Fin'.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em> can only end in two ways. First, more common, is the fortress getting destroyed by something, ranging from a pack of goblins, to endless demon hordes, to <em>all</em> your dwarves throwing themselves into spiral of murder because of a lone kitten. However if you manage to survive all that, eventually and inevitably your fortress will grow so large your computer will be unable to keep up and the FPS drop will force you to abandon it.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3">PlayStation 3</a> game <em>Girl Fight</em> has several files detailing information on each girl's background and objective, and hints at a plot involving cyberspace and a seemingly helpful AI trying to aid you against a shadowy organization called The Foundation. Yet when you fight through the arcade mode and defeat the final boss, your "ending" is a sexy digital pinup of your chosen fighter, and that's it; your character's goal, along with all the AI and Foundation hooey, is just completely dropped. One could argue that you shouldn't expect a throwaway <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Shovelware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Shovelware">shovelware</a> game to bother with proper endings, but it's very easy to argue back that if a developer won't provide any closure to a fighting game's story, they might as well save time and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlotNoProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlotNoProblem">leave out the story altogether</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostInTheStatic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostInTheStatic">Lost in the Static</a></em>, after you pass the giant, you get a bunch of extremely easy screens. At the last one, the static fuzz which makes up the game's graphics start getting more and more indistinct until you see nothing but a screen full of static (normally, you can discern the various objects in the game by how the static moves in a specific place), then the static starts to fade until you have a white screen, and then the game closes.

</li><li> In <em>Blades of Time</em>, after a lot of nonsense and some eleventh-hour plot twists, the protagonist and two companions finally escape back through the sphere to the other world, where they find themselves locked into a building.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TronTwoPointOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TronTwoPointOh">TRON 2.0</a></em> had an ending that left more open than it resolved. Sure, Jet was able to rescue his father and the pair of them made it back from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyberspace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyberspace">cyberspace</a>, their rocky relationship a little smoother now. Ma3a was uploaded to safety, and it was implied that Mercury made it to safety as well. Thorne died, ending the threat of the Z-lot invasion, and the plan to launch a horde of Datawraith mercenaries to conquer the digital world was halted. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerribleTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerribleTrio">Crown, Popoff, and Baza</a> were stuck on on a hard drive with Alan in <em>no</em> hurry to free them. Their mysterious boss (implied to be Dillinger) is still at large, and Alan cuts him off in mid-threat in the final scene. Encom is still a company in trouble, and still might be taken over by the bad guys from F-Con, and there is absolutely no word at all about what happened to <em>all those Datawraiths already shot in</em>.

</li><li> The penultimate mission in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JudgmentRites" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JudgmentRites">Judgment Rites</a></em>. Kirk and company board a strange alien ship that's about to land on a Federation colony. The ship turns out to be populated entirely by mentally-damaged individuals, but the main computer has been sabotaged and only vague clues as to the ship's origins can be located. Finally, after a lot of messing about, the away team manages to reach the ship's database and access it. It offers an explanation as to the ship's origins, but that explanation conflicts with other data in the computer. When Kirk points this out, the computer suddenly reveals that it was all just a test by an alien civilization that has nothing to do with the ship or the people on board, and you move on to the next mission.
</li><li> The adventure game <em>Blue Ice</em> had no ending screen whatsoever, and no indication that you've completed all the puzzles. The ultimate goal was to find all the clues necessary to decode a secret phrase, and send the solution to the authors in hopes of getting a prize. The authors didn't put in an ending screen to prevent players from cheating their way into the ending and claiming the prize—the only way of finding out if you won was... to ask the authors if your guess was right (<a class="urllink" href="http://www.the-spoiler.com/OTHER/Psygnosis/blue.ice.3/index.html">or just look up the solution on the Net<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>).

The three playable characters simply face the screen while credits roll in the background. The English localization and the Japanese <em>Mother 1+2</em> GBA rerelease add in an extended ending, in which everyone is shown alive and well (including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Teddy</span>, who was implied to have died in the original).

The final boss laughs and says something about "Those old men must be scared shitless right now" then dies. Kei (the protagonist) screams <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNO">NOOO</a> then the scene switches to the two cops who helped the party throughout the game and their car EXPLODES for literally no reason. Only the young cop survives, also screaming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNO">NOOOOO.</a> THEN the scene shifts to some guy in a white suit talking on the phone, then hanging up and wondering if he'll ever meet the party in person.

The Pirate epilogue also only extends to what happens right after you complete the final mission, while the other storylines' goes at least a few decades ahead.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JourneyToSilius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JourneyToSilius">Journey to Silius</a></em> has very little plot as it is, but the ending is a single still image with no text, and then the credits roll.

It goes about for another four missions that are all <em>rehashed</em> version of levels that players <em>have already beaten in the previous chapter</em>. Completing these level doesn't progress the story and there is no new content from that point on. There was supposed to be a true final mission which resolves the conflict between <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eli and Diamond Dogs, ending in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> fight against Sahelanthropus, but the mission was left unfinished and removed from the game, leaving the game with literally no ending</span>.

Rick's then told by the Terror mask that the deal made hasn't been fulfilled, so he can't remove it. While Dr. West is killed, by Possessed!Jennifer, the narrative then stops with a cut to credits. Due to a layoff variant of Cancellation of the whole development team of the game and no details of if they had a direct sequel in mind out in public as of April 2018, the potential cliffhanger became a no ending.

</li><li> Improfanfic is notorious for this, due to various factors. Among the things that can kill an Impro dead:
<div class="indent">- A writer's part is simply too difficult to follow up on, and future writers skip rather than try to tackle it. <br/>- A series of skips and a complete lack of signups when the queue runs dry more or less torpedoes the fic. <br/>- The admin for a given story just stops caring, doesn't prod writers, doesn't run queue signups, and probably leaves IFF entirely. <br/>- The story is in "ending mode" with a fixed final queue, and the last author never bothers writing the last chapter. (This most famously happened to m.t.c.f.f. ULTRA, the original flagship of IFF, which <em>still</em> has not been ended a decade later, and <strong>still</strong> lists <em>an author who abandoned writing the finale</em> as the final author.)
</div></li><li> Most plotlines in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/NationStates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/NationStates">NationStates</a> end this way, as posters become uninterested or disconnected and move on to other things. It'll be a cold day in the Rejected Realms, as it were, when you see an actual epilogue. The good ones have sequels, though, so it's not as much of a problem as you might think.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGreenWanderer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGreenWanderer">The Green Wanderer</a></em> doesn't end with Marrox finally succumbing to his illness, nor does it confirm or deny that Marrox succeeding in redeeming himself.

Then Lisa said "What shall we do now?" and it cuts to the cast surfing like in the final version of the ending.</span> The DVD Commentary reveals that they wanted to make the ending as unexplained as possible, as a nod to all "caper" themed movies.
</li><li> In Season 11's "Missionary: Impossible", Homer becomes a missionary, goes to a tropical island, builds a church and then rings the bell so loud a volcano(!) erupts. Just as Homer and a native girl he calls "Lisa Jr." are falling into the lava (presumably to their doom) a PBS-style fundraising pitch cuts in and the episode ends. This tied in to the start of the episode, where a Britcom he's watching on PBS gets cut short by the announcement of a pledge drive. This episode also qualifies as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory">"Shaggy Dog" Story</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9z6f1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9z6f1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9z6f1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS13E22PoppasGotABrandNewBadge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS13E22PoppasGotABrandNewBadge">Poppa's Got A Brand New Badge</a>" references the episode, showing that Homer <em>did</em> survive. Lisa Jr.'s fate remains ambiguous, however.</span>
</li><li> "The Computer Wore Menace Shoes" ends with the Simpsons still trapped in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePrisoner1967" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePrisoner1967">The Island</a>.
</li><li> "Das Bus" has a similar ending, with the audience only knowing the children were saved thanks to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesEarlJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesEarlJones">narrator</a> who says they were saved by "well, let's say... Moe". In that case, it's a parody of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordOfTheFlies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordOfTheFlies">Lord of the Flies</a></em> ending.
</li><li> The episode "We're on the Road to D'ohwhere" plays this even further. At the start of this episode, Homer ends up having to drive Bart (who's on a no-fly list) to a correctional facility after a prank, all the while annoyed that he's missing a Las Vegas trip with his bar buddies, and Marge and Lisa have a garage sale. In the very last scene, Lisa checks the answering machine and learns that Marge has been arrested for drug trafficking, Homer is in prison after brawling with a pit boss, and Bart's gone missing. Lisa says she always knew it'd come down to her and Maggie and that she'll look for work in the morning. The episode ends there.
</li><li> In "The Twisted World of Marge Simpson", Marge starts a pretzel company, and to one-up her rivals, Homer hires the Mafia to take them down a notch. However her rivals do some tit-for-tat of their own by hiring the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a>, which leads to a massive gang battle on the Simpsons' front lawn. The episode ends abruptly in the middle of the fight with no resolution. According to the audio commentary, the writers were stumped for an ending.
</li><li> "A Totally Fun Thing That Bart Will Never Do Again": The family is stranded on Antarctica. We then see Bart as an old man but how/when they were rescued is never explained.
</li><li> "E Pluribus Wiggum" never reveals how Ralph's presidential campaign turned out. We see a fake ad asking the people of Springfield to vote for him and then...credits.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Chowder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Chowder">Chowder</a></em> episode "Paint the Town" ends with Chowder leaving Mung Daal, Truffles and Shnitzel stuck in an alternate dimension with no way home...then it suddenly goes to black on their cries for help...which Chowder doesn't hear.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButtHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButtHead">Beavis and Butt-Head</a></em> episode "Cow Tipping" was about Beavis and Butt-head going cow tipping and it results with Butt-head pushing over a cow that crushes Beavis. Just then the crazy farmer appears and calls the cow as good as dead and gets his chainsaw. Beavis tells the farmer to kill the cow and not him...it fades to black and all we hear is Beavis scream, the chainsaw running and the farmer laughing. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack">By the next episode, Beavis is fine with no explanation.</a>

</li><li> "The Chamber of Frozen Blades" ends with Finn and Jake punching the Ice King for kidnapping Dr. Princess.
</li><li> At the end of "Evicted!", Finn and Jake discover their tree house is being flooded with worms, and they get hypnotized by its king. Do they snap out of it and fight him? (cue the end credits) <em>Three seasons</em> later "King Worm" shows them confronting him, but in a way that makes no sense as a followup.
</li><li> "Box Prince" just ends with the matter of which cat was the real prince left unresolved and Finn getting licked by a bunch of cats.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em>:
<ul><li> "I Was a Teenage Gary": SpongeBob and Squidward turn into snails and meow at the moon with Gary, with no explanation how they turned back to normal by the next episode.
</li><li> "Wormy" ends with Sandy coming home and catching Wormy-turned-butterfly, and SpongeBob and the others cheer her for catching the "monster" while she thinks they're happy she came home. The LeapPad adaptation fixes this by adding an extra scene where Sandy explains to SpongeBob and Patrick that the "monster" was Wormy all along.
</li><li> "Doing Time": Mrs. Puff being sent to solitary confinement turns out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a>. SpongeBob gets arrested for crashing the boat during the test... only for an officer to point out that Mrs. Puff's already served her sentence. This results in another cop out where SpongeBob isn't driving the boat; one of her cell mates is. Mrs. Puff wakes up yet again and says, "Ah, forget it!" to close the episode.
</li><li> "Club SpongeBob" ends with SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward still in the kelp forest with no resolution how they got home.
</li><li> In "Gullible Pants", Mr. Krabs goes into the Krusty Krab, only to see SpongeBob, whom he had left in charge, dancing in front of a crowd that's cowering in fear. Then the episode ends without resolution (only Mr. Krabs being demoted to busboy).
</li><li> "Dear Vikings": After SpongeBob saves the viking ship from sinking, it ends. Do he and Squidward make it back home? We don't know.
</li><li> "Chum Caverns" ends with the Krusty Krab buried underground with captive customers.

While the plot with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">OWCA</a> ended, the subplot with Candace trying to show their mom that the boys turned into babies stops at where everybody in the room except for Candace being turned into babies (who then hopes things go back to normal by the next episode).

<ul><li> The episode "Big Flakes" has the eponymous characters still trapped in the cabin and now reduced to eating nails and wood. It then cuts to outside the cabin, and all the snow has melted except the snow that's still covering the cabin. Everyone outside is oblivious to the snowed-in cabin. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEnd">The End</a>.
</li><li> "The Cat That Laid the Golden Hairball": Stimpy appears to be dying, because "When a cat loses its hairball gland, it's over." Ren suddenly repeats "It's over!" cheerfully. Stimpy hops up to echo him just as happily, and the characters dance briefly before the credits roll.
