<p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling">Professional Wrestling</a> is very much a family business, after all, the secrets of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">Kayfabe</a> are more secure when passed down to relatives rather than shared with outsiders. There have been many, many families involved with the pseudo-sport; generally, it begins with a successful patriarch, whose children all follow him into the business. If you're part of a wrestling family, you have an in-built <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGimmick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGimmick">gimmick</a>; you're a second-generation (or, less likely, third-generation) wrestler trying to live up to the legacy of your forefathers. You also have in-built allies when things get rough; namely, your brothers. Sometimes however, family members are portrayed as antagonistic towards each other, especially if they are brothers.

A family may even blend the two, as did the Von Erichs (primarily made up of the Adkisson family, though two members, Waldo and Lance Von Erich, weren't Adkissons). A family may not even be acknowledged on screen (such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheWildSamoans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheWildSamoans">Anoa'i family</a>, whose members include almost every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildSamoan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildSamoan">Wild Samoan</a> in North American wrestling [and the one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">sumo</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlingDoesntPay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlingDoesntPay">wrestler</a>]), though its presence is certainly felt.

<p></p><h3>Real Life Families</h3>
<p></p><ul><li> The most obvious and well-known example of this is the <strong>McMahon</strong> family, who own and operate WWE.
<ul><li> The Patriarch of the McMahon family is Roderick James "Jess" McMahon. Jess McMahon was a boxing promoter prior to becoming a wrestling promoter, and he co-founded the original Capitol Wrestling Corporation with Toots Mondt, which he ran from the 1920s through the 1950s. Jess had three children; Dorothy, Roderick Jr., and Vincent James...
</li><li> Vincent J. McMahon was the only of Jess' children to get involved in the wrestling business, and he took over his father's role in the CWC after his death. He renamed the company to the World Wide Wrestling Federation and later the World Wrestling Federation, but his major area of promoting was the Northeast, mainly in New York City, New Jersey, and Baltimore, Maryland. His domination of the most densely populated part of the US made the company one of the most lucrative territories of the NWA. He had two sons; Roderick James III and Vincent Kennedy. In the early 80s, with his health failing, he sold the WWF to the latter...
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> Today, Patriarch <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince</a> is the behind-the-scenes AND onscreen chairman and CEO of the company, and wrestles on a semi-regular basis, having held both the WWE and revived ECW World Championships.
</li><li> Wife Linda was the offscreen and onscreen CEO (leaving the offscreen role to run for Senate in Connecticut), and a member of the board of directors (it gets confusing because onscreen, Vince supposedly owns a quarter of the company, yet he's constantly being thwarted by the rest of the board of directors, usually in the guise of Linda).
<ul><li> Vince owning a "quarter" of the company is something of an anachronism, as the shares were flipped around during the Invasion storyline. In short: each of the McMahons owned 1/4 of the stock of the company. Shane sold his to a mystery investor to buy WCW. Stephanie sold hers to a mystery investor to buy ECW (Vince didn't apparently think through the fact that this made WCW and ECW, which in reality Vince bought with essentially pocket change, look as though they were worth 25% of whatever the WWF was at the time). Vince somehow got control of Linda's shares, but after the Invasion it was revealed that the two "mystery investors" were the same person: Ric Flair. Vince eventually beat Flair to unify all the stock, and it's never been re-split.
</li></ul></li><li> Son <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShaneMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShaneMcMahon">Shane</a> has been, in order, part of the ring crew, a referee (under the name "Shane Stevens"), a "backstage official", a color commentator, a member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheCorporation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheCorporation">The Corporation</a> (a Heel faction), a "wrestler" (European and Hardcore Champion), "owner" of WCW and leader of the WCW-ECW Alliance, and tag-team partners with his father. Offscreen, he was the Vice President of Global Media for WWE until his departure in 2009, leaving to become the CEO of a technology company dedicated to bringing widespread internet access to Chinese citizens. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesBack">Then he returned in 2016</a>, was General Manager (and later comissioner) of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackDown">WWE SmackDown</a></em>, was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam">Tag Team</a> champion with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz">The Miz</a> and led his own posse after turning heel before being given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">kayfabe</a> boot.
</li><li> Shane's wife Marissa Mazzola-McMahon co-hosted <em>WWF Livewire</em> for a time, and worked for the WWF's PR department. Their older son, Declan James McMahon, was born in 2004 and appeared in the opening video package of WrestleMania XX, and their younger son, Kenyon Jess, was born in 2006.
</li><li> Daughter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon">Stephanie</a> got her first company gig in the mid 80's as a teenager when she modeled t-shirts and other merchandise in the WWF catalog. She was first introduced on screen in the late 90's by being almost "sacrificed" by the Undertaker. She later married <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a>, faked a pregnancy, divorced him, and has been Women's Champion. Offscreen, she's Executive Vice President, Talent and Creative Writing, and married to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a> for real. The two have three daughters, Aurora Rose (who has "appeared" in a hilariously disturbing sketch at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a></em>), Murphy Claire, born in 2008, and Vaughn Evelyn, born in 2010.
</li></ul></li></ul><p>A comprehensive list of Wrestling Family trees is probably impossible. However, we shall try... first, the real families:
</p><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GeorgeWagner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GeorgeWagner">George Wagner</a> debuted in 1929, found fame in the 30s as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker">Trope Maker</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GorgeousGeorge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GorgeousGeorge">Gorgeous George</a> and adopted a son who wrestled as Gorgeous George Jr. His grandnephew, wrestled as Gorgeous George III, then as The Maestro.
</li><li> Frank Murdoch, who worked under various gimmicks in Texas from the 1930s to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">60s</a> had a step son who wrestled as the evil bar brawling biker Dick Murdoch. Dick Murdock also had a cousin known as Tim Brooks, bounty hunter and champion of various North American territories.
</li><li> Debuting in the Tri-State territory in 1932, eventual NWA World Junior Heavyweight Champion and Midwest Championship Wrestling promoter Leroy <strong>McGuirk</strong> would go on to have a daughter named Michelle, who served as an interviewer for the WWF as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">Mike</a>". Mike would go on to have a son named Max, who became a wrestler in the Southwest area of the US. Mike also married Brian Blair, who has a niece best known for wrestling in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WorldWonderRingSTARDOM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WorldWonderRingSTARDOM">World Wonder Ring STARDOM</a> named Chelsea.
</li><li> Mexican icon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ElSanto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ElSanto">El Santo</a> ("The Saint") wrestled professionally for over forty years and starred in over fifty films in his career, becoming an icon to the people of Mexico (think of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart">Bret Hart</a> and his status in Canada, plus the street cred of being <em>the closest thing there is to an honest-to-God <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCape">superhero</a></em>), was first trained by his brother, Black <strong>Guzmán</strong>, and had two other luchador brothers, Pantera Negra and Jimmy Guzmán. His son, El Hijo del Santo ("The Son of the Saint"), made his debut shortly before his father's retirement in 1982 and has become almost as popular, still competing after nearly thirty years. He has even had popular matches with contemporary Mexican stars who've attained fame north of the border, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterioJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterioJr">Rey Mysterio Jr.</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EddieGuerrero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EddieGuerrero">Eddie Guerrero</a>, and is probably one of the best wrestlers in the world who has never made an appearance in the WWE or other American promotions besides those on the independent circuit such as IWR, PWR and the NWA remnants. Three of El Santo's grandsons also wrestle, unfortunately, <em>very nasty legal issues</em> regarding the name of <em>El Nieto del Santo</em> ("The Grandson of the Saint") - due to the first not being a direct descendant of <em>El Hijo del Santo</em> but rather his nephew - forced him to go with a very similar yet not identical mask and also to use his first name ("Axel") as wrestler name. <em>The legal issues are ongoing to this very day</em>. The other two grandsons go by Rocker II and Santo Jr.
</li><li> The <strong>Guerrero</strong> family began with father Salvadore "Gori" Guerrero. Gori's four sons would all wrestle (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EddieGuerrero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EddieGuerrero">Eddie</a>, who passed away in 2005, Chavo, Hector, and Mando). Chavo's son <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChavoGuerreroJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChavoGuerreroJr">Chavo Guerrero Jr.</a> had a long, successful run in WWE. In the wake of Eddie's death, WWE provided his widow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VickieGuerrero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VickieGuerrero">Vickie</a> with a non-wrestling personality job. She has served as General Manager for both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWERaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWERaw">RAW</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackDown">SmackDown</a></em> and has later played a managerial role. Eddie and Vickie's daughter Shaul was signed to a development contract with WWE and worked in FCW as a valet for the Ascension under the name Raquel Diaz before leaving the business for a time, returning to WWE developmental in NXT, and then leaving the business again, eventually marrying Matthew Rehwoldt, better known as Aiden English of the Vaudevillains and Rusev Day fame. Herlinda Guerrero, wife of Gori and mother of his children, had three brothers who wrestled: Enrique, Mario, &amp; Sergio Llanes. Enrique's son Javier was also an excellent wrestler.
<ul><li> After Eddie's passing in 2005, the rumor was that Vince had promised Vicky that if they chose, there would always be some member of the Guerrero Family employed in WWE. This did remain the case until the spring of 2020, when Matthew Rehwoldt (Aiden English) was released from his contract, alongside over 20 other wrestlers, as part of WWE's cost cutting measures.
</li></ul></li><li> The brothers Firpo and Bobby <strong>Segura</strong>, who were apart of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">first high profile</a> mask and hair <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliatingWager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliatingWager">wager matches</a> of Mexico. Firpo would have a son named Carlos and Bobby one named Canelo, who would enjoy ten years with EMLL.
</li><li> Florida standout Ann <strong>LaVerne</strong> would get with Mississippi standout Roberto Pico (who had debuted as Pancho Villa in 1937). Later Ann's daughter Marie (who wrestled with her mother's maiden name) and son Bobby Lane(<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames">another old ring name</a> of Roberto's) would become wrestlers who found success in Texas and the central states, respectively. Marie would marry Canadian Gordon Nelson, who worked under the "Mister Wrestling #2" gimmick and their son Steve would then become a wrestler before going to compete in mixed martial arts for Shooto.
</li><li> Alfonso <strong>Amezcua</strong> from Jalisco, Guadalajara, who debuted in 1937 and was better known as Golden Terror and Black Monster #3, until he was unmasked by El Santo and The Olympicos, respectively, was succeeded by two sons Septiembre Negro and Alfonso Dantés, and also had a son in law he trained to be a luchador, Indio Jerónimo. Septiembre Negro's son became the luchador Blade, while Alfonso had two sons who became luchadors, Apolo and César Dantés. Alfonso also had a brother-in-law luchador, Alberto Muñoz, the uncle of Apolo and César.
</li><li> Robert <strong>Fuller</strong>, who later became Col. Parker of "Stud Stable" fame, has a brother in Ron, father in Buddy and grandfather in Roy Welch who were in the wrestling business. After starting in 1939, Roy was followed by three more Welch brothers in Herb, Jack and Lester. Herb had two sons who wrestled named Doyle and Bobby. Jack had a wrestling daughter named Jojo. Lester had two wrestling sons named after his brothers, Roy Lee Welch and Jackie. Jimmmy Golden aka Bunkhouse Buck is a first cousin of Robert and Ron. In addition, Jerry Jarrett (father of Jeff) is believed by many to be an illegitimate son of Roy Welch (his mother, Christine Jarrett, was a secretary and later a live event promoter for Welch).
</li><li> Chris <strong>Belkas</strong> who wrestled in the US South for the National Wrestling Association in the 1940s and the National Wrestling Alliance in the 50s, married Florida legend Sherrie Lee. They were the father and mother in laws to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SuperStarBillyGraham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SuperStarBillyGraham">Super Star Billy Graham</a>. Belkas's nephew wrestled in Canada as Ski Hi Lee.
</li><li> The largest would be the <strong>Harts</strong> of Calgary. Father Stu and mother Helen sired twelve children. Eleven would go on to either wrestle or marry wrestlers. His seven wrestling sons were Smith, Bruce, Keith, Dean, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart">Bret</a> (the most famous), Ross, and the youngest, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/OwenHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/OwenHart">Owen</a>, who died when a stunt went wrong in a 1999 Pay Per View. Son Wayne became a referee. All four daughters married wrestlers: Ellie (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimNeidhart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimNeidhart">Jim Neidhart</a>), Georgia (B.J. Annis), Alison (Ben Bassarab), and Diana (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DaveyBoySmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DaveyBoySmith">Davey Boy Smith</a>). The third generation of Harts has entered wrestling, as Diana and Davey Boy's son Harry wrestles in WWE as D.H.

</li></ul></li><li> Another legendary Canadian wrestling family are the <strong>Rougeaus</strong> of St. Sulpice, Quebec, who have been actively involved in wrestling for almost seventy years. The first wrestler in the family was Eddie Auger, who debuted in the 1940s, and worked as a trainer after his ring career ended. Auger's nephews, the brothers Jean (Johnny) Rougeau and Jacques Rougeau Sr. had lengthy careers as wrestlers and promoters in and around Quebec. Four of Jacques's five children also entered the wrestling business; sons Raymond, Jacques Jr. (best remembered as the Mountie), and Armand all became wrestlers, while daughter Joanne worked backstage for the WWF from 1985-1999 and also married a wrestler (Denis Gauthier Sr.). Jacques Jr. currently runs a wrestling school and promotes shows in the Montreal area, and his son Jean-Jacques (J.J.) Rougeau has begun wrestling on the independent circuit, making him the fourth generation of the family to compete in the wrestling ring.

Her brothers are Damien (Pitbull) and Pierre (The Beast) who wrestled in Extreme Canadian Championship Wrestling. Vivian's son Ian Carnegie is an arm wrestler.
<ul><li> Luna was married to and raised children with WWE's Attitude Era vampire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DavidHeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DavidHeath">Gangrel</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> The most tragic would be the Adkissons, better known as Texas's favorite sons, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VonErichFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VonErichFamily">Von Erich Family</a>. Not counting Fritz's "brother" Waldo and Waldo's "nephew" Lance, the family consisted of father Jack (Fritz Von Erich), and sons Jack Jr., David, Kerry, Chris, Mike, and Kevin. Jack Jr. was electrocuted in childhood, while David died under mysterious circumstances in Japan in 1984 (either enteritis or drugs, depending on who you ask), and Kerry, Chris, and Mike all committed suicide in the years before Jack's death.

<ul><li> Kevin, the barefoot high-flyer, is the only survivor. He has four children, and does real estate as well as controlling old WCCW footage.
</li><li> Two of Kevin's sons, Ross and Marshall, have finished training as wrestlers.

</li></ul></li><li> As noted, the <strong>Anoa'i</strong> family of Samoa has any number of relations. The Anoa'i branches of the family tree start with the Wild Samoans (Afa and Sika Anoa'i). All three of Afa's sons are wrestlers (Samu, Afa Jr. (also known as Manu), and Lloyd (who wrestles as Alofa The Samoan Tank or L.A. Smooth, depending)). Afa's daughter, Monica, was married to Gary Albright before Albright's death. Sika's sons Matt and Joseph are also wrestlers, the former best known as The Hurricane's sidekick, Rosey, and the latter as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield">The Shield</a>'s muscle and later the WWE's new poster boy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a>. Afa and Sika's two other siblings sired wrestlers  brother Junior's son Rodney wrestled as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Yokozuna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Yokozuna">Yokozuna</a>, and sister Vera Fatu's sons all wrestled (Sam as Tama, Solofa as many names, most famously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Rikishi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Rikishi">Rikishi</a>, and Eddie as Jamal then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Umaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Umaga">Umaga</a>). Rikishi's twin sons Jonathan and Joshua became a top <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam">tag team</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUsos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUsos">Jimmy and Jey Uso</a>. Samu's son Lance also became a wrestler. Afa also has a nephew who wrestles most notably in Europe as Black Pearl.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimmySnuka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimmySnuka">James "Jimmy Snuka" Reiher</a> is related to the Anoa'i family through marriage, as is his son Jimmy Snuka Jr. (formerly "Deuce" of the "Deuce N' Domino" tag-team, then a Legacy hopeful as Sim Snuka, before being released). And his daughter Sarona, who goes by the name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TaminaSnuka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TaminaSnuka">Tamina</a> in WWE and started out managing her cousins the Usos before playing a more active role in the Divas division.
</li><li> Closely related to the Anoa'is by friendship, but not blood, is the Maivia family. Father Peter considered Afa and Sika's father his blood brother, and the friendship has extended through the generations(at least back to 1953). Peter's wife Lia has been promoting wrestling in Hawai'i for years, while Peter and Lia's daughter Ata married <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RockyJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RockyJohnson">Rocky Johnson</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">You may have heard of Rocky and Ata's son</a>...
<ul><li> Afa and Sika actually started out as ultra-mark Maivia fans in San Francisco who would threaten to beat up his heel opponents. Fearing a riot, promoter Roy Shire had Maivia befriend them, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">sent them far, far away to be trained in wrestling</a>. Maivia's real name is Pita Anderson. Early in his career, since "Anderson" didn't sound particularly Samoan, he was brought to the UK as a "brother" to longtime Samoan wrestler "Prince" Neff Maiava. The two met years later and became blood brothers and best of friends, and Neff's grandson Kaluka Maiava (a former linebacker for the NFL's Cleveland Browns and Oakland Raiders) considers himself a cousin to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">The Rock</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Anoa'i clan is actually so pervasive that from the formation of the WWF/E until mid-2009, there has always been at least one member in the promotion. And then, later that year, Rikishi's twin sons were signed to a developmental contract and became the Usos. Sarona Snuka/Tamina followed soon after.
</li><li> It also includes WWE female performers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Naomi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Naomi">Naomi</a> via marriage to Jimmy Uso and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NiaJax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NiaJax">Nia Jax</a>, who is The Rock's cousin.
</li></ul></li><li> The Brothers Sputnik and Jet <strong>Monroe</strong>. Sputnik also had a wrestler son in Bubba.
</li><li> The <strong>Blanchard</strong> family consists of late wrestler and promoter Joe, who debuted in 1953 and had a run later that decade as Zorro in Texas before being unmasked by Cyclone Anaya; Joe's son Tully, most famous as part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheFourHorsemen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheFourHorsemen">The Four Horsemen</a> and now an AEW producer; and Tully's daughter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TessaBlanchard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TessaBlanchard">Tessa</a>.
</li><li> The <strong>Linares</strong> family started with Black Sugar, who made his name in Lucha Libre in La Arena Olímpico Laguna, who also had two brothers who joined him on the roster of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMLL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMLL">EMLL</a>, Tony Sugar and Rayo de Jalisco. The latter's son would carve out his own legacy as Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and also marry a luchadora known as Mitzuki Wong, the two having a son who would wrestle as Rayman. Tony's sons would also take on the 'rayo' gimmick, wrestling as Rayo Star and Ultra Rayo, while Black Sugar's son would wrestle as El Tigre de Guanajuato. Black Sugar and his brothers also have a grandnephew who wrestles as Saruman.
</li><li> Irma <strong>González</strong>, who occasionally wrestled as Novia del Santo, had a luchadora sister, Reyna González and a daughter luchadora, Irma Águilar. Águilar would marry luchador Hara Kiri and their son would wrestle as Hara Kiri Jr while Águilar's son with ex husband Lasser would wrestle as Mafaras.
</li><li> The <strong>Brazo</strong> Family in Mexico may be the single biggest wrestling family, although most of them aren't well known outside Mexico. The family patriarch, Shadito Cruz, started as early as 1959 and predates the family's gimmick. His sons are Brazo de Plata (aka Super Porky from WWE's short lived Juniors division, probably the best known outside Mexico), Brazo de Oro, El Brazo, Brazo Cibernético, Super Brazo, and Brazo de Platino. Brazo de Plata had several sons and daughters who all got involved in wrestling - his sons are Máximo, Kronos(who became Psycho Clown), Robin, Golden Magic, and Andros de Plata, his daughters Goya Kong and Muñeca de Plata. Brazo de Oro's son is known as La Máscara, his daughter Aramís and Lady Apache of the Apache family is his former wife. Brazo Cibernético's son took on the Robin Hood Jr gimmick(to distinguish himself from his father). Súper Brazo's son decided to keep the family gimmick and remain Súper Brazo Jr.
</li><li> A few more from Mexico which, seemingly due to the value placed on tradition, seems to be completely steeped in this trope...
<ul><li> The <em>Hernández</em> family: The two pairs of half-brothers who steadily debuted from the mid-1940s to early '50s, Sugi Sito, Huroki Sito, Panchito Robles and Manuel Robles. Sugi's daughter went into the business as La Briosa. Huroki's son became Black Cat of Los Gringos Locos.

</li></ul></li><li> From Cuba in 1967 (and the Dominican Republic in the latter's case) came the <strong>Castillo</strong> Brothers Fidel and Raoul, who were best known outside of the Caribbean for wrestling in Maple Leaf, New Japan and the Hart's Stampede. Fidel was also known as Ciclón or Huracán Castillo when wrestling without his brother, leading to his son wrestling as Huracán Jr. His son in turn would enter the business as AJ Castillo. Raoul's son would also wrestle as Magnificent Chris but suffer an untimely death three years into his career.
</li><li> The <strong>Dundee/Eaton</strong> family consists of Bill Cruickshanks, better known as Bill Dundee; his son Jamie, who has frequently performed as Jamie Dundee but is better known as J.C. Ice; Bill's son-in-law Bobby Eaton; and Bobby's son Dylan.

K. Wallstreet, and most famously IRS). Rotunda's own sons, Windham and Taylor, are also wrestlers. Under the name Husky Harris, Windham competed on NXT season 2 and was with the Nexus for a few months, and now is one of WWE's top heels as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrayWyatt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrayWyatt">Bray Wyatt</a>.

Taylor also met his wife Sarah Bäckman during her brief (two months) stint in NXT as Shara.
</li><li> The <strong>Finlay</strong> Family, David Finlay Sr. and his father were wrestlers in the Irish and British scene. David Sr's wife, Evelyn, was the back office manager and driving force behind the Northern Ireland Olympic Wrestling Association. David and Evelyn's son, David Jr. aka Fit Finlay would make a name for himself in Catch Wrestling Association, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling">New Japan Pro-Wrestling</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a>.

And, just to confuse matters, Rey Misterio Sr.'s son also wrestles under the same mask as El Hijo de Rey Misterio. To confuse matters even further, El Hijo de Rey Misterio briefly retired from professional wrestling, after which time Rey Misterio Sr. and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Konnan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Konnan">Konnan</a> introduced a new wrestler in May 2011 who also went by the name El Hijo de Rey Misterio (though his relationship to the Misterio family is unknown). The original El Hijo de Rey Misterio then returned in November of that year, wrestling under the name El Hijo de Rey Misterio I. We now have, in order of debut: Rey Misterio Sr.; Rey Mysterio; El Hijo de Rey Misterio I; and El Hijo de Rey Misterio. To confuse matters even FURTHER, the original El Hijo de Rey Misterio sometimes wrestles as Rey Misterio Jr. The Misterio/Mysterio family also includes El Hijo de Rey Misterio's other cousin Metalika and his uncle Super Astro. The most recent member of the family to become involved in wrestling is Rey Jr.'s real-life son Dominik, who was involved in a few of his dad's WWE storylines in his childhood (though not as a wrestler), and started formal wrestling training in 2017. In 2020, Dominik was brought into an angle between his father and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins">Seth Rollins</a> and had his in-ring debut against Rollins at SummerSlam. The Misterio family almost included a fictional member - bookers considered making Dioncio Castellanos a member of the family, and even considered giving him the Rey Misterio Jr. gimmick. However, he ended up becoming Rey Misterio Jr.'s arch-rival <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Psicosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Psicosis">Psicosis</a>.

</li></ul><p></p><h3><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrelatedBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrelatedBrothers">Fictional Families</a></h3>
<ul><li> The Andersons of Minnesota, for the most part, aren't related at all. Gene Anderson was the only real Anderson. "Brothers" Lars (Larry Heinimi) and Ole (Alan Rogowski) were college friends. "Nephew" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ArnAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ArnAnderson">Arn</a> (Marty Lunde) resembled the "family" and happened to arrive in the NWA Mid-Atlantic area when Ole needed a tag-team partner. "Cousin" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">Ric Flair</a> wasn't related to any of them, but was billed as cousin to help get him over as a star. The only other legitimate Anderson is Gene's son Brad. The Carolina branch of the Anderson family (Pat, Rocky, and C.W.) all have a broad physical resemblance, but none are related. Clouding the issue somewhat is the fact that WWE's Ken Kennedy was actually born <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KenAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KenAnderson">Ken Anderson</a>; he was asked to change his name upon making the big time, so as to avoid confusion with the fictional family. When he was future endeavored by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a>, he joined TNA as "Ken Anderson", though nothing has been made of the name or possible Anderson family connections.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BulletClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BulletClub">Karl Anderson</a> was originally billed as a member in the indies, which probably still holds true. Chad Allegra himself has no known relation to any of the above, he's just another bald wrestler with a full beard.
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of Kennedy, he nearly got into a second family (in part) because of it. Throughout much of 2007 and into 2008, the WWE ran a "Who Is Vince McMahon's Bastard Child?" storyline, where one of Vince's numerous flings had had a son and was now suing McMahon for owed child support while simultaneously keeping the identity of the child a secret to mess with his head (yes, it's very hard to assert paternity for a child you refuse to identify. It's wrestling writing, go with it). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartMark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartMark">Smarks</a> immediately pointed at Ken Kennedy as the likely son; he had Irish heritage, like the McMahons, he was due for a push, and hey  Vince's full name is Vincent <em>Kennedy</em> McMahon. Unfortunately for Kennedy, right when the reveal was scheduled, he got himself suspended for violations of the WWE Wellness Program (read: failed a drug test), forcing WWE to punt. They wound up naming Dave "Fit" Finlay's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leprechaun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leprechaun">Leprechaun</a> sidekick, Hornswoggle, as Vince's bastard son. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeMonthRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeMonthRule">When enough time had passed</a>, it was announced that Hornswoggle wasn't really McMahon's son, he was really Finlay's son and Finlay was scamming McMahon for... well, no reason really, but at least the storyline could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">put to bed</a>. Kennedy would eventually get his push by feuding with RAW's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel">Heel</a> General Manager, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WilliamRegal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WilliamRegal">William Regal</a>... until <em>that</em> storyline had to be aborted when <em>Regal</em> got suspended for a Wellness violation, and shortly thereafter Kennedy would get injured. He really couldn't catch a break.
</li><li> As noted above, the Grahams have an interesting history. The "real" Graham appears to be Dr. Jerry Graham. Jerry later "adopted" Grady Johnson as "Crazy" Luke Graham. The Grahams then added Eddie Gossett as brother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EddieGraham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EddieGraham">Eddie Graham</a>, who'd go on to be the most successful wrestler and promoter in the fictional family. Wayne Coleman would later team with fellow Phoenix native Jerry in the Los Angeles territory as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SuperstarBillyGraham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SuperstarBillyGraham">"Superstar" Billy Graham</a>, on his way to becoming WWWF champion. Various sons and nephews of the Grahams have wrestled, with the most successful being Eddie's son, Mike, who wrestled mostly in Florida, and then promoted there after his father's suicide.
</li><li> Another wrestling clan who blended real and fictional relations were the Garvins and their associates. The original Garvin tag team consisted of fictional brothers Ronnie (Roger Barnes) and Terry (Terry Joyal). Joining them a few years later was a third "brother", Jimmy Garvin (James Williams), who in real life was actually Roger Barnes' stepson. Since they were only seven years apart in age, though, it was possible to pass them off as brothers on the screen. Later in his career, Jimmy Garvin would be managed by his real-life cousin Sunshine (Valerie French), though their relationship was never revealed to the audience. Sunshine was later replaced as Jimmy's manager by Precious (Patti Williams), who is his real-life wife. If that isn't already tangled enough, Sunshine during her stint with WCCW was also given a fictional relative, her "aunt" Stella Mae French (Tanya West).
</li><li> Then, there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheDudleyBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheDudleyBoys">The Dudley Boys</a>. Created as a running storyline gag in early ECW  the joke was that all the Dudleys had one father, a traveling salesman named Big Daddy Dudley, but each had a different mother  the family numbered nearly a dozen at one point. Three of them would go on to greater success: Bubba Ray (Mark LoMonaco), D-Von (Devon Hughes), and Spike (Matt Hyson). Now that Bubba Ray and D-Von are back in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a>, they're working under the Dudley name again; while they were in TNA, they had to use other names, as WWE owns the Dudley trademark. Instead, they took the name Team 3-D, a reference to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Finishing Move</a> the Dudley Death Drop which was often referred to in short hand as the 3D, in TNA, as Brother Ray, Brother Devon, and Brother Runt (Hyson). Later, they retired the team, and LoMonaco turned heel (changing his name to "Bully Ray") by attacking Devon (who dropped the "Brother" part of his name). Runt didn't return to WWE along with Bubba Ray and D-Von.
<ul><li> The Dudleys that got the most ring time were the three aforementioned - Bubba, D-Von and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">Little Spike Dudley</a>. The supporting cast, if you will, included Big Dick Dudley, Chubby Dudley, Dances With Dudley, Dudley Dudley, Little Snot Dudley, Psycho Sam Dudley, Schmuck Dudley, Sign Guy Dudley, and Studley Dudley, their manager. In the WWF, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StacyKeibler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StacyKeibler">Stacy Keibler</a> acted as the "Duchess of Dudleyville".
<ul><li> At one show, The Bushwhackers (Butch &amp; Luke) were revealed to be their long-lost cousins. At ECW's second PPV, <em>Hardcore Heaven 97</em>, porn star Jenna Jameson also made an appearance as "Lady Dudley".
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Also noted above were two fictional Von Erichs. Jack Adkisson made Walter Sieber into Waldo Von Erich when he needed a tag-team partner, and later turned nondescript rookie Ricky Vaughn into Waldo's "son" Lance Von Erich when injuries and deaths depleted the real Adkisson family. What made Lance most notable (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/ThereIsNoSuchThingAsNotability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/ThereIsNoSuchThingAsNotability">sorry!</a>) was that when Lance later jumped from Adkisson's World Class Championship Wrestling promotion to the outlaw (rival promotion operating in the same geographical area as an established promotion in competition) Wild West Wrestling, Adkisson made the then-rare move of breaking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">kayfabe</a> and admitting, on World Class' television show, that Vaughn wasn't related to the family.
</li><li> The McMahons, as their entry notes, play a fake wrestling family based somewhat on their reality. Vince plays himself up as much more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">arrogant and evil</a>, constantly cheating on Linda with a string of divas. Shane and Stephanie play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">conniving rich brats</a> who hate their father and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Schemer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Schemer">constantly scheme against him</a> - except, of course, when they team back up with him. Linda rarely shows up, and if she does it's usually just to act disgusted with whatever Vince has done lately — in the fake McMahon family, Vince and Linda seem to be separated.
<ul><li> They're married in-storyline; Linda's just very... forgiving.
<ul><li> Which seems to have originated as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> aimed at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">the Clintons</a>.
</li><li> Truth in Television. Vince admitted in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Playboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Playboy">Playboy</a></em> interview to have constantly screwed around on Linda in the eighties, and was accused of sexually harassing a tanning bed employee only last year. However, as Vince is someone whose blood could test positive for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">kayfabe</a>, little of what he says should be taken as fact.
</li><li> Then again, Linda's Crowning Moment Of Awesome was at WrestleMania X-Seven, when she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">kicked Vince in the balls</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> HHH is a part of the fake family too, after a long period of the WWE pretending he wasn't. After Randy Orton attacked Vince, Shane, and specifically Steph, they finally pulled the trigger and had HHH admit, on camera, to being married to Steph and Steph being the mother of his children, even going so far as to have other characters refer to him as "the last McMahon standing", so welcome to the fake family, HHH! This is a very recent development, so there are currently no deviations we can see between real HHH's standing in the family and his fake standing. Married to Steph, has kids with her, loves his wife... that's pretty much all we got at the moment. One <em>does</em> wonder at what point after their "divorce" HHH and Steph decided to give it another go, but screw it. That storyline was way more than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeMonthRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeMonthRule">three months ago</a>.
</li><li> During that long period of HHH being a member of the real McMahon family but not the fake version, he seemed to take a nearly unholy glee in bending <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">kayfabe</a> nearly to the breaking point by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">teasing that fact</a> whenever possible, mostly to have some fun with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartMark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartMark">smarks</a>, who knew damn well what was up, and as the knowledge became commonplace, the entire audience.
<ul><li> When Stephanie was pregnant for the first time  after their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">kayfabe</a> divorce  HHH got in the ring and called that fact out, completely in character... and then <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ePO8GEB570">went on to wonder<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> at the identity of the father and his no-doubt prodigious sexual equipment.
</li><li> When the McMahons gathered in the ring for a family portrait, HHH came up too and demanded to be included. He didn't give a reason, merely saying that he "deserved" to be in any McMahon family portrait, and let the fans figure it out for themselves. Stephanie got into the act that time, kissing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a> during the family portrait to supposedly "piss off [her] father". HHH, not to be one-upped, responded to the kiss with "Bye Steph, see ya at home! Uhhh... errr... I mean, your brother's a gnome!"
</li><li> HHH even managed to pull this once when he wasn't there. When he had to miss an episode of RAW because Stephanie was giving birth to their second child, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DGenerationX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DGenerationX">DX</a> partner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels">Shawn Michaels</a> (HBK) explained that HHH wasn't there because he was secretly following the McMahons (whom DX was feuding with at the time) and added that he thought HHH had some inside information on this "baby business". He finished with a camera close-up during which he said that between him and the fans, he thought HHH knew who the father was.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane">Kane</a> are on-screen half-brothers... though sometimes, the bizarre <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">retconning</a> that's gone on about their family history may be thick enough to actually obscure this fact. A more recent example; SmackDown General Manager <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VickieGuerrero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VickieGuerrero">Vickie Guerrero</a>, to wear The Undertaker down before his PPV match with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge">Edge</a>, booked him against Kane. The match started with a lengthy sequence of arm-locks going nowhere, noted by the commentators as a consequence of the brothers not really wanting to hurt each other. All of this brotherly love makes little sense if one remembers that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeMonthRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeMonthRule">in recent times,</a> they had a very character-driven match based on the fact that Kane had <em>killed</em> The Undertaker for becoming the American Badass<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3aqvn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3aqvn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3aqvn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Vince d. Taker in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GimmickMatches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GimmickMatches">"Buried Alive" match</a> at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SurvivorSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SurvivorSeries">Survivor Series</a> 2003</em> as a result of Kane's interference.</span> and forgetting his roots as a monster, and The Undertaker <em>came back from the dead</em> for revenge. It's pro wrestling; what're ya gonna do, accuse it of being unrealistic?
<ul><li> Not to mention that Kane or Undertaker (don't ask) may or may not have murdered their parents in the first place... of course, at the same time, Kane's biological father was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulBearer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulBearer">Paul Bearer</a>. Better to just ignore that whole parental storyline, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceRusso" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceRusso">Vince Russo</a> wrote it.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstInstallmentWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstInstallmentWins">Just think of Taker and Kane as brothers and forget the rest. It's easier that way.</a>
</li><li> Some poor writer actually had to make sense of the entire thing in <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_into_Darkness:_An_Unauthorized_History_of_Kane">an actual, published book<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, however.
</li><li> The late wrestling parody site Scoop This did a short article on the brothers' history, going through Kane's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">graduating from dental school</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy">his Kevin Nash infatuation</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Interestingly, since Undertaker and Kane have been depicted as brothers on WWE programming for almost as long or longer than some fans have been alive, many are genuinely surprised to learn that Mark Calaway and Glenn Jacobs, the men portraying them, are not actually related.
</li></ul></li><li> And of course, the Hardy Brothers. Although we can probably safely presume that Real Matt is <em>not</em> making constant attempts on Real Jeff's life.
</li><li> An odd example where a kayfabe Wrestling Family has been sundered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityDrift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityDrift">Continuity Drift</a> is the Canadian 'brothers' (and real-life childhood friends) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge">Edge</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Christian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Christian">Christian</a>, who were first paired up in WWE in stable The Brood (where they apparently had some sort of relation to their leader Gangrel, but this was never fully explained), then went on to become one of the most decorated tag teams in history. Their feuds with the Hardys and the Dudleys remain famous, and at the time effectively pitted three sets of wrestling brothers against each other. However, at some point in the last decade, during a long period spent apart in solo careers, the relevance of their being 'related' was apparently deemed rather low in comparison to the relevance of their great past success as a team; so subsequent on-screen reunions have merely referred to their history as a partnership but quietly forgotten the fraternal bond. Presumably, according to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeMonthRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeMonthRule">Three Month Rule</a>, they therefore now never were brothers.
<ul><li> They have in fact gone into detail about their real past history together several times since 2010, so it's safe to say the brotherhood has been retconned.
</li></ul></li><li> The Legacy stable has been entirely composed of subsequent-generation wrestlers: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TedDiBiaseJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TedDiBiaseJr">Ted DiBiase Jr.</a> (although the "Jr." is dropped in WWE as with Rey Mysterio), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CodyRhodes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CodyRhodes">Cody Rhodes</a>, and former Legacy hopefules "Manu" (Afa Anoa'i Jr.). and "Sim Snuka" (Jimmy Snuka Jr.).
</li><li> Japan has this too with Kensuke Office, an agency/touring group (or at least the banner under which they appear for promotions) which centers around Kensuke Sasaki and his adoptive son Katsuhiko Nakajima and is run by Sasaki's wife, famous female wrestler Akira Hokuto. Along with two biological sons, they're also called the Kensuke Family.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KeijiMutoh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KeijiMutoh">The Great Muta</a>(Keiji Mutoh) was initially introduced in the West as the son of the Great Kabuki. Later, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FightingOperaHUSTLE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FightingOperaHUSTLE">Fighting Opera HUSTLE</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGiant">Monster Bono</a> was introduced as Great Muta's son, though Bono is more like a monster he accidentally created when he magically impregnated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale">Yinling</a> instead of his biological offspring. Nonetheless, he adopted him as a legitimate child, and joined him and his mother. The family had a sad end, as Yinling was killed by Bono in retribution to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">abuses</a>, and Muta <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">sacrificied himself</a> to send <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller">The Esperanza</a> to the underworld in order to save his son.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmandaShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmandaShow">The Amanda Show</a></em>, there was a sketch involving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearFamily">Nuclear Family</a> all consisting of wrestlers.
<ul><li> Fun fact: The father and son in this family were modeled after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldust">Goldust</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/OwenHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/OwenHart">The Blue Blazer</a>, respectively.
</li></ul></li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a>'s AWA and NWA days, he regularly tag teamed with Ed Leslie. The two were promoted as brothers, sometimes using the names Terry &amp; Ed Boulder, and sometimes Hulk &amp; Dizzy Hogan.
<ul><li> Hulk did have one legitimate family member in wrestling. His nephew Horace wrestled for WCW.
</li></ul></li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBigShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBigShow">The Giant (Paul "The Big Show" Wight)</a> first showed up in WCW, they billed him as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AndreTheGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AndreTheGiant">Son of André</a>.
</li><li> There were the Holly Cousins in the Attitude Era, none of whom were related to each other. First there was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobHolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobHolly">Bob "Hardcore" Holly</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CrashHolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CrashHolly">Crash Holly</a> who tagged together. At the end of 2000 a third cousin, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MollyHolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MollyHolly">Molly Holly</a>, was introduced (and who wasn't from Mobile, Alabama where they were billed from either). The three cousins went their separate ways around mid 2000-ish though the announcers did keep continuity going between them.
</li><li> In TNA this is coupled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeNationality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeNationality">Fake Nationality</a> with kayfabe cousins <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SarahStock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SarahStock">Sarita</a> and Rosita, both billed from Mexico. Rosita is actually from New York and Sarita is Canadian, though she took up residence in Monterrey, then in Mexico City (and she's not Hispanic either).
</li><li> One of the original plans for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sable">Sable</a>'s feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TerriPoch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TerriPoch">Tori</a> (not Wilson) in 1999 was for Tori to turn out to be Sable's biological sister. Indeed many reports for the shows where Tori would be seen sitting in the front row would point out how similar they looked. The creative team then scrapped that idea and made Tori just an obsessed fan.
</li><li> In early 2008 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KatarinaWaters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KatarinaWaters">Katie Lea</a> was called up to the main roster to be the kayfabe sister of Paul Burchill in a controversial angle with some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestSubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestSubtext">Incest Subtext</a>.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TerryFunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TerryFunk">Terry Funk</a> and Dory Funk Jr. were in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWF</a> (and Dory was renamed Hoss Funk for some reason), they recruited unrelated brother Jimmy Jack Funk (actually Jesse Barr, listed above) who was billed as the "crazy" younger brother (this is with Terry on the team, mind you). The gimmick was so stupid that Terry left the company and Dory followed after a couple of months, leaving "Jimmy" to job out the rest of his contract.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl">My Name Is Earl</a></em>, Joy's half-sister Liberty is aspiring to join BLOW (Black Ladies of Wrestling). She plays "Lady Liberty," and her husband Ray-Ray plays her evil manager, "Da Man." (Even though he'd rather go for walks with his pet bearded dragon.)
</li><li> "La Familia del Dinamita" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerStable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerStable">Power Stable</a> was a mixture of real family members such as Cien Caras and his aforementioned brothers, as well as fake family members such as the aforementioned Cien Caras Jr.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JackSwagger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JackSwagger">Jack Swagger</a>'s "father" made a pair of appearances in WWE, getting his ass kicked by Kane both times. Swagger's father was played by Bunkhouse Buck, a WCW midcarder and tag team champion from the mid 90s.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NickDinsmore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NickDinsmore">Eugene</a> was originally introduced as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EricBischoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EricBischoff">Eric Bischoff</a>'s nephew.
