<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> website, managed by Biglobe, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">listed Sayoko and Nunnally as "dead"</span> while the show was still airing, which has made some sections of the fanbase blame the creators for supposedly lying. This, and to some extent the whole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeed">Mu La Flaga</a> debacle, causes part of the fandom to assume that they could also be lying about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lelouch</span>'s death. Then again...considering that Sunrise as a company, Biglobe and the main creative staff aren't all one and the same, they might contradict each other without actually having to lie.
</li><li> One of the most constant accusations leveled at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Mitsuo Fukuda and Chiaki Morosawa.</a> Apparently, this one's born less from them <em>actually</em> lying, and more from sub-par translations of their interviews. And some nice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScapegoatCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScapegoatCreator">Scapegoat Creator</a> stuff.
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NabariNoOu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NabariNoOu">Nabari no Ou</a></em>, Yuhki Kamatani's official character sheet for Kouichi claimed that he was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">14 years old</span>, leading to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a> effect when his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">immortality was revealed</span>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Technically</a></em> it's not a lie because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his persona as "Aizawa Kouichi" is 14 years old</span>, but it was intentional misdirection nonetheless.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EiichiroOda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EiichiroOda">Eiichiro Oda</a>, the creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, has been known to do this with details of story arcs that haven't appeared yet. Arguably the biggest one is the re-reveal of Sabo. The official source guide to <em>One Piece</em> called "The Green Book" both said that Sabo was dead after his ship was sunk by a World Noble. But Oda would dodge the question whenever he was asked personally. Sure enough, Sabo was showed to be alive. Another example is that in 2001, Oda was asked by a fan when the Straw Hat Pirates would arrive at Fishman Island. Oda responded that they would arrive "soon." They arrived at Fishman Island in 2010, <em>nine years later</em>.
</li><li> Toei got one over the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyCure">Pretty Cure</a></em> fandom during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuitePrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuitePrettyCure">Suite Pretty Cure ♪</a></em>: a blurry picture of two Cures, Cure Beat and Cure Symphony, was leaked onto the Internet and fan speculation went wild. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out, it was fake - there was a Cure Beat, but it wasn't the one on the picture, but there was no Cure Symphony - it was Cure Muse's role! Turns out Toei was pissed off when the identity of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeartcatchPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeartcatchPrettyCure">Cure Sunshine</a> was accidentally revealed a month prior to her first appearance.</span>
</li><li> From the words of Gen Urobuchi during the creation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em>: "I have been entrusted with the formidable task of series composition and script for all episodes.

</li><li> Director Sato Tatsuo said, "No romance", in regards to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BodaciousSpacePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BodaciousSpacePirates">Bodacious Space Pirates</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RinneNoLagrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RinneNoLagrange">Rinne no Lagrange</a></em>. What he really meant was "No <em>heterosexual</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians">romance</a>". Or, in the latter, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoRomanticResolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoRomanticResolution">No Romantic Resolution</a>"</span>.
</li><li> Ohkubo, author of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em>, has been reported as saying both that the series was going to leave <em>most</em> relationships platonic as well as <em>all</em> relationships platonic. Given that the series has a mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHuggingNoKissing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHuggingNoKissing">No Hugging, No Kissing</a> feel, it doesn't seem too far-fetched. There is a reason why many fans refer to him as a Troll. At the end of the manga, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">most of the relationships do remain platonic, but two side characters (Stein and Marie) hook up.</span>
</li><li> The writer to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YukiYunaIsAHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YukiYunaIsAHero">Yuki Yuna is a Hero</a></em> stated it was going to be a heartwarming, new form of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a> genre. While it does <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurprisinglyHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurprisinglyHappyEnding">have a less bittersweet ending</a> than expected</span> the series is <em>anything</em> but fluff <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome">after the halfway point</a>, and it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> series.
</li><li> The director of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SSSSGridman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SSSSGridman">SSSS.GRIDMAN</a></em> claimed that the series was not related in any way to the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DenkouChoujinGridman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DenkouChoujinGridman">Denkou Choujin Gridman</a></em> live action series, but an alternate universe. They even had, in a promotional press-release, suit actors wearing the original Gridman costume with a brand new costume based off of the anime version. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This was to hide the fact the series <em>was</em> a continuation of the original <em>Gridman</em> show and that Gridman's anime look actually hid the original live-action version.</span>
</li><li> The director of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Persona5TheAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Persona5TheAnimation">Persona 5: The Animation</a></em> claimed that there would be a significant twist that would deviate from the game's story.

<ul><li> In preparation for the relaunch of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em> comic as <em>Ultimate <strong>Comics</strong> Spider-Man</em>, he told readers that this would be an all-new way of telling Spider-Man stories, and there would even be a new Spidey... this turned out to be simply metaphorical, as Peter went through certain relationship and status quo changes in the course of a six month timeskip, but remained Spider-Man. The funny thing about this is that for the first four months, fans used everything from the manga-esque artwork and Peter's new, very feminine appearance (a result of the artwork, not the writing), to proclaim that Bendis was telling the truth and that Peter was actually his female clone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderWoman">Jessica Drew</a> in disguise. The return of Jessica in the Ultimate Enemy mini-series finally put this speculation to rest.
</li><li> According to Bendis, this is less Lying Creator and more creator changing his mind. Bendis had been wanting to kill off Peter for a while to make room for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffirmativeActionLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffirmativeActionLegacy">"multiracial" Spider-Man</a>. He wanted to do it during Ultimatum while they were killing off most of the other heroes, but decided there was still a story or two he wanted Peter to star in. He eventually made good on his promise and created a new Spider-Man, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MilesMorales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MilesMorales">Miles Morales</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> At <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a>, the company announced that it would rename <em>Countdown</em> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CountdownToFinalCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CountdownToFinalCrisis">Countdown to Final Crisis</a></em>, readers were sure that the book was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>, that the events in it would smoothly lead into the next <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">Crisis Crossover</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis">Final Crisis</a></em>. That... didn't happen at all.

</li><li> The maxi-series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FiftyTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FiftyTwo">52</a></em> included creator commentary from its writers, editors and artists when the issues were collected in the trade-paperbacks. In the commentary for Week Seven, Mark Waid points out that not even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BoosterGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BoosterGold">Booster Gold</a> would be <strong>so</strong> stupid as to pay a sham-villain by check when he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound">staging false heroics to increase his fame</a>, and he says people should keep reading and have some faith to see the payoff. This is never brought up again. Mark Waid does it again in the commentary for Week Thirteen, where he discusses the obscured-in-shadow figure in the background of the last panel; he says that he thought he knew who the character was when he wrote the script, but Week Forty-Two showed him that it was a different character entirely. Unfortunately for Mark, the trades include occasional reprints of the original scripts and the revelation in Week Forty-Two is <em>exactly</em> who the original script said it would be. Dan Jurgens, the creator of Booster Gold, also lied about his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead">death</a> halfway through; he had an interview where he discussed how he felt about Booster being killed off and he gave no hint that it was fake, so either Jurgens agreed to cover it up or DC did not tell even <em>him</em>.
</li><li> When DC Comics made Bart Allen into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a> in 2006, after former Flash Wally West retired to look after his newborn twins, they launched a new series (called "The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive") to chronicle his adventures. The initial writing team on the series was not well-liked by fans, (to put it mildly) so DC replaced them with new writer Mark Guggenheim, who told fans and interviewers that he had years worth of storylines dreamed up for Bart. DC hyped issue #12 of the series as a major event, but also solicited a 13th and 14th issue, complete with cover artwork. In reality, the series had already been set to end with Bart being killed off in issue 12; no 13th or 14th issues existed, and Guggenheim had known this from day one. The whole thing was a (mostly successful) ploy to take fans by surprise with Bart's death. Afterward, Wally West was brought back as the Flash, his twins now conveniently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOperaRapidAgingSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOperaRapidAgingSyndrome">rapid-aged to teenagers</a> so he didn't need to look after them quite as much. Oh, and those covers? Used in a special between the last issue of <em>Fastest Man Alive</em> and the return of Wally's title and the first issue of Wally's title.
</li><li> After <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackestNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackestNight">Blackest Night</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanDiDio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanDiDio">Dan DiDio</a> claimed that from now on dead characters would <strong>stay dead</strong> and not be subject to resurrections. Cue <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Flashpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Flashpoint">Flashpoint</a></em> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a> relaunch, and now a bunch of dead characters are back thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">Cosmic Retcon</a>.
</li><li> Mike Grell:
<ul><li> Early in the run of his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JonSableFreelance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JonSableFreelance">Jon Sable, Freelance</a></em>, publisher First Comics said that unlike at Marvel or DC, at First creators own their creation and if Mike Grell ever left, he would be allowed to take Jon Sable with him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Instead</a>, they gave the title to another artist.
</li><li> Grell also originally said that he wanted the characters in this series to age as time went by. He was able to keep this up during the series' original run from 1983 to 1988 during which the characters got five years older. But when the series was restarted in 2005, the characters were not thirty years older and they apparently now live in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime">Comic-Book Time</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Marvel's Editor-in-Chief <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeQuesada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeQuesada">Joe Quesada</a> does it a lot:
<ul><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> unmasked himself, he explicitly stated that Spidey's newly public identity would not be undone after a year or so with a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">magic retcon</a>." Guess what happened (and <em>then some</em>) about a year later? If you need any help understanding that, read <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OneMoreDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OneMoreDay">One More Day</a></em> for answers.
</li><li> And we have his "Dead is Dead" policy... which seems to only be enforced for characters he doesn't like or killed off himself, such as Karen Page. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JeanGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JeanGrey">Jean Grey</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Psylocke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Psylocke">Psylocke</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto">Magneto</a>, Harry Osborn and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuckyBarnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuckyBarnes">Bucky Barnes</a> have all come back, which makes fans annoyed that he's not allowed the writers to bring Karen back, since it's obvious he doesn't really mean it. Although between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar">Civil War</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WorldWarHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WorldWarHulk">World War Hulk</a></em> Joe Quesada admitted that the "Dead stays Dead" policy was stupid (since in comics it's like trying to plug a dam after the valley is flooded).
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Everyone</em> at Marvel involved in the debut of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thunderbolts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thunderbolts">Thunderbolts</a></em> (and by association, Marvel as a whole) was a lying creator, going so far as to lie during interviews and magazine articles about the true identities and motivations of the protagonists. Justified, of course, to keep <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> a secret until it actually debuted.
</li><li> Something similar was done in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUltraverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUltraverse">The Ultraverse</a></em> back in 1993; Malibu solicited issue 5 of the <em>Exiles</em> series even though the series was actually ending with a near-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">Total Party Kill</a> in issue 4.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor">X-Factor</a></em>, Jamie Madrox died from the legacy virus, and it was stated this Jamie was not a duplicate. But in a shocking twist, it turned out to be a duplicate that had died.
</li><li> <em>Dark Avengers/Uncanny <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a>: Utopia</em> crossover. Writer Matt Fraction promised that in a fight between two teams <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGuy">Colossus</a> would be a balance for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute">Ares</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick">Sentry</a>. They never meet in the story - Ares was fighting with New Mutants, Sentry faced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Namor</a> and only thing that Colossus did was fight Venom. Also, Fraction promised some interaction between teenage alien Noh-Varr and teenage mutant girls (not that kind). It didn't happen. Fraction kept his promise about a fight between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>'s son <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daken">Daken</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeSexClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeSexClone">X-23</a>. He just had to add two other girls to the mix.
<ul><li> Fraction later admitted that the Noh-Varr part at least was an honest mistake — he hadn't realized <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that the character would have left the team by that point</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> When it was announced that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ScarletWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ScarletWitch">Scarlet Witch</a> would join the post-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion">Secret Invasion</a></em> incarnation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MightyAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MightyAvengers">Mighty Avengers</a></em>, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanSlott" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanSlott">Dan Slott</a> promised that it would be the <em>real deal</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Loki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Loki">Loki</a> in disguise.</span>
</li><li> In the run-up to the massive <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JokersLastLaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JokersLastLaugh">Joker's Last Laugh</a></em> crossover, in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> is diagnosed with fatal cancer, it was announced that he would die for real at the end of the crossover's central miniseries, and that he would STAY DEAD at least until a new creative team took over the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em> books, and possibly longer. Instead, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it turns out that the Joker's tumor was never real. And though the Joker is beaten so severely by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing">Nightwing</a> that he requires CPR, he is back to normal by the last page.</span>
</li><li> At San Diego Comic Con 2010, James Robinson, in response to Roy Harper's right arm being hacked off in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueCryForJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueCryForJustice">Justice League: Cry for Justice</a></em>, stated his intent was to create a superhero with a prosthetic limb which was not cybernetic in honor of the numerous Iraq War veterans sporting false and missing limbs. It should be noted that Robinson included a nod to veterans in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackestNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackestNight">Blackest Night</a>: Superman</em>, but in the introduction to the trade of <em>Cry for Justice</em>, Robinson makes absolutely no mention of any veterans and states that it was the decision of the editors to move Roy in that direction.
</li><li> Something similar occurred with Robinson's run on the main <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> book. He famously had to write out the majority of the team after one arc and replace them with a line-up, which he claimed was due to his desire to work with a smaller cast. In a later convention panel, he revealed that he had been forced to write out most of his original cast because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>.
</li><li> An odd one for Marvel: When the comic book company cancelled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">Avengers West Coast</a></em> in favor of <em>Force Works</em>, Wonder Man had his own comic. Well, in the first issue, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WonderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WonderMan">Wonder Man</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">dies saving the other team</a>. At the same time, there was a listing for his title's next issue where he and The Beast team up to fight the Hate Monger. The next month, there's a note listing off upcoming issues stating that, because of this death, his title was cancelled. It's hard to wonder if this was something akin to the Flash example above or perhaps a major case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">Poor Communication Kills</a>
</li><li> <em>Hooooo, boy</em>. The early saga of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SuperiorSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SuperiorSpiderMan">Superior Spider-Man</a></em> was rife with this. When the character was revealed, Dan Slott told people that it was going to be a brand new person under the mask and not Peter Parker. Even more, there was a tweet mentioning Miguel O'Hara, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan2099" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan2099">Spider-Man 2099</a>, leading fans to think <em>he</em> was the new Spidey. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Technically, it's still Peter, but Miguel was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a>, in a way</span>. Then came the final issue of <em>Amazing Spider-Man</em> where we find out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Peter died within Dr. Octopus' broken body and Otto is living in Peter's.</span> Fans were <em>livid</em>, especially when Dan said that they'd eventually warm up to the new status quo, mostly due to the fact that an early issue hinted that "Peter" and Mary Jane would hook back up. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out that a piece of Peter's still living inside, trying to win back his body and Otto ended up breaking up with MJ in a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies">It's Not You, It's My Enemies</a></span>.
</li><li> The 2009-2019 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity">Alternate Continuity</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga">The Clone Saga</a></em> miniseries was originally advertised as originally intended. Not only was that hard to do, given a fraction of the people involved came back and the <a class="urllink" href="http://lifeofreillyarchives.blogspot.com/">Life of Reilly<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> series showed each writer had their own ideas on what to do, but part of the intent of <em>The Clone Saga</em> (like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OneMoreDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OneMoreDay">One More Day</a></em> ultimately did) was to make Peter single again, and the series ends with Peter still being with Mary Jane and the two of them going to raise their daughter.
</li><li> When Nick Spencer's highly controversial <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmericaSteveRogers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmericaSteveRogers">Captain America: Steve Rogers</a></em> #1 revealed that Steve Rogers was actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/HYDRA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/HYDRA">HYDRA</a> sleeper agent, Axel Alonso and Nick Spencer promised that it was a totally legit retcon of the character's entire past and not due to reality-warping or memory manipulation. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The very next issue then revealed that the whole thing was the result of the Red Skull using Kobik to warp reality in order to rewrite Cap's memories.</span>
<ul><li> Spencer then promised that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SecretEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SecretEmpire">Secret Empire</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">Crisis Crossover</a> followup to that story, would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">not be resolved with</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a Cosmic Cube</span>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It was, as Kobik, who <em>was</em> the Cosmic Cube, recreated the good-guy Cap to defeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Steevil</a>.</span>

He ended up providing a surprise end to the series in issue #193, with Image going so far as making covers for the non-existent #194 and #195 for solicitations, as Kirkman wanted to have the comic "die" as unexpectedly as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">its characters</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman2011">Wonder Woman (2011)</a></em>: Prior to the publication of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a>'s retool of Wonder Woman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianAzzarello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianAzzarello">Brian Azzarello</a> promised he wasn't changing her origin. Her origin had always been a woman with no father, whose powers and personality were all due to her upbringing by a peaceful egalitarian society of women. Azzarello's version was the daughter of an incestuous relationship between Zeus and his granddaughter, whose powers all came from Zeus and whose more heroic qualities were in spite of her being raised by a society of baby murdering, serial rapist, violent warrior misandrist women.

<ul><li> For many years, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield">Garfield</a></em> creator Jim Davis claimed that his first strip <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/GnormGnat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/GnormGnat">Gnorm Gnat</a></em>, which featured all insect characters, ended with a giant foot stepping on Gnorm and crushing him. Countless news sources, documentaries, and even <em>Garfield</em> anthologies reported this as the demise of the strip (if they even brought it up at all). The strip's obscurity (it was published solely in the <em>Pendleton Times</em> of Pendleton, Indiana) meant that no one was able to challenge this claim until summer 2019, when several strips were finally unearthed — and the final strip merely features the title character giving Christmas wishes to the city of Pendleton.

<ul><li> The team behind <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLEGOMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLEGOMovie">The LEGO Movie</a></em> repeatedly said that properties that weren't under the umbrella of Warner Bros. wouldn't be appearing in the movie, with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> (owned by Disney by that point) used most frequently, despite the 15+ year history of licensed <em>Star Wars</em> LEGO sets. Consequently, when the <em>Millennium Falcon</em> does show up (complete with main fanfare and most of the original actors reprising their roles), it was a huge and pleasant surprise for fans.
</li><li> The current legend about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YellowSubmarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YellowSubmarine">Yellow Submarine</a></em> is that Erich Segal scripted it.

Jack Mendelsohn, who is in the credits, said that he took a leave of absence from Hanna-Barbera to write <em>Submarine</em> for producer Al Brodax, and Brodax turned it over to Segal to "punch it up." So since Segal was the last man on the script, he was the guy taking credit for it. Brodax himself and Lee Minoff, who did the story outline, are also listed under screenplay because animated films do not fall under the same jurisdiction as live action films which allows the producer to put in anybody he wants.

<h3><strong>In General:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> It's standard procedure for the more anticipated films to be produced under a false title, sometimes until they actually arrive at the theaters, to keep people from spying on the shootings or intercepting the reels. For instance, during production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>, the crew worked under the title "Blue Harvest". But in that case, it was less about snooping fans and mostly to avoid the headaches during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em> when the locations charged extra because they knew a <em>Star Wars</em> movie was being filmed.
</li></ul><h3><strong>By Creator:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SachaBaronCohen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SachaBaronCohen">Sacha Baron Cohen</a> needed to create dozens of fictional organizations for the production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Borat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Borat">Borat</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bruno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bruno">Brüno</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DaAliGShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DaAliGShow">Da Ali G Show</a></em> to gain the interviews and access he needed without being found out.
</li></ul><h3><strong>By Movie:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> Prior to the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises">The Dark Knight Rises</a></em>, Christopher Nolan and the cast were very clear on two things: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Robin did not and would never exist in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy">The Dark Knight Trilogy</a></em>, and Miranda Tate <em>was not Talia al Ghul.</em> Miranda Tate is in fact Talia al Ghul, and "original character" John Blake is actually <em>Robin</em> John Blake - a composite of all the Robin incarnations. Granted, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Blake seems to be taking up the mantle of Batman, not Robin</a>. At one point, Nolan also claimed Robin, if he existed, would be too young to work with Batman right after <em>The Dark Knight</em>. Sure enough, <em>Rises</em> takes place eight years later, and Blake was a fan of Batman as a kid.</span>
</li><li> Ben Stein got a <em>lot</em> of flack for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Expelled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Expelled">Expelled</a></em> by interviewing scientists like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardDawkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardDawkins">Richard Dawkins</a> and P.Z. Myers under the pretense that the movie was simply going to be a discussion of science vs. religion. When it came out as a full-on Intelligent Design screed casting Dawkins and Myers in very bad light, we all learned a lesson on trust.
</li><li> While addressing the controversy around <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GhostInTheShell2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GhostInTheShell2017">Ghost in the Shell</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ScarlettJohansson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ScarlettJohansson">Scarlett Johansson</a> said that she was not playing a Japanese character, and that she would never play someone of another race. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The big Reveal of the movie is that Johansson's character was originally a Japanese girl named Matoko Kusanagi.</span> Johansson's comments were probably a denial of playing in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yellowface" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yellowface">Yellowface</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em>:
<ul><li> Eon Productions made sure to say in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyfall">Skyfall</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Naomie Harris was only an agent named Eve, not Miss Moneypenny. Harris herself stated that she couldn't see the character in a desk job. Then in the film's ending, Eve states she's not fit for field work and reveals her full name as Eve Moneypenny...</span>
</li><li> In the lead in to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre">Spectre</a></em>, both Eon and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristophWaltz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristophWaltz">Christoph Waltz</a> vehemently denied that the latter's character Franz Oberhauser <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was actually Ernst Stavro Blofeld</span>. Cue third act dramatic reveal.
</li><li> Waltz did it again in the lead up to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NoTimeToDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NoTimeToDie">No Time to Die</a></em> when he claimed that he would not return for the film and that there was a "new enemy". Cue <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an imprisoned Blofeld</span> featuring prominently in the debut trailer.

He's the subject of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a>.
</li><li> The promotions for both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan3">Iron Man 3</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxyVol2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxyVol2">Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</a></em> played up their villains (the Mandarin and Ayesha, respectively), hiding the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herrings</a> and other characters were the true villains of the films</span>.
</li><li> The Russo Brothers said that the title of <em>Avengers 4</em> was not mentioned in the dialogue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar">Infinity War</a></em>. Cue the first trailer revealing the title <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame">Avengers: Endgame</a></em>, which was something Dr. Strange said to Tony <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after giving Thanos the Time Stone</span>. ("We're in the Endgame now.")
<ul><li> A possible example with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther2018">Shuri's</a> fate: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul">Angela Bassett said that she survived the snap</a>, but the teaser trailer showed that Shuri was missing, a set of posters released later had her among the dead characters, and the film itself all but stated that she was killed by the snap. However, Basset might not have actually been lying, she could have just been wrong about it, since a lot of actors were given false information to prevent them from spoiling the movie (although that means someone else lied about it instead).
</li></ul></li><li> During the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel2019">Captain Marvel</a></em> press tour, in one interview <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelLJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelLJackson">Samuel L.

</li></ul></li><li> In pre-release interviews with <em>Fangoria</em> Magazine (Issue #99, Dec. 1990), director <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenHopkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenHopkins">Stephen Hopkins</a> and screenwriter John Thomas flatly and mockingly denied that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">more Predators would show up</span> at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Predator2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Predator2">Predator 2</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScaryMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScaryMovie">Scary Movie</a></em> gives us the tagline "No Mercy. No shame. No sequel." True when it was the only <em>Scary Movie</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself">at the time</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIntoDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIntoDarkness">Star Trek Into Darkness</a></em>: JJ Abrams and the film's writers said <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they didn't feel comfortable tackling an updated version of Khan.</span> They lied.
<ul><li> When speculation rose in 2012 that the villain was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Khan Noonien Singh</span>, Karl Urban shot it down by suggesting Benedict Cumberbatch was playing Gary Mitchell, the villain in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">TOS</a> pilot, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS1E3WhereNoManHasGoneBefore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS1E3WhereNoManHasGoneBefore">Where No Man Has Gone Before</a>". Obviously, he was also lying. It's also somewhat amusing when you consider Urban himself is <a class="urllink" href="http://cheezburger.com/6632094976">practically a dead ringer for Gary Lockwood<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leonard Nimoy</span> said he had nothing to do with this film. He lied, as he's got a cameo.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas">George Lucas</a> in regards to practically everything <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>-related.
<ul><li> Are there six films? Nine films? Twelve films? Depends on when you ask him, but expect him to disavow any other option. When did Darth Vader become Luke's father? Since the beginning? Eh, probably not based on drafts of the scripts, but that's what he'll tell you.
</li><li> During the filming of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em>, Lucas and the film crew went to great lengths to avoid anyone spoiling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> before release... to the extent of replacing the line <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather">"I am your father"</a> with "Obi-Wan killed your father" in the script, so if anyone did leak the big secret, they'd leak the <em>wrong secret</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkHamill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkHamill">Mark Hamill</a> was only told of the revelation a moment before the scene was filmed, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidProwse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidProwse">David Prowse</a> wasn't informed. Thanks to Vader's full face mask, they were able to simply take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesEarlJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesEarlJones">James Earl Jones</a> aside, record the real line in secret, then swap it in during editing. In fact, David Prowse was famously annoyed that he was not told since his body language would have been completely different otherwise. Hamill also claimed he would have acted differently if given more time to prepare.
</li><li> Another one is George Lucas's pretension that he had some grand artistic vision, broken like a butterfly upon a wheel by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">remorseless studio execs</a>, which is only now achieving full bloom with the "updated" re-release. The fact that later edits remove some of his changes (such as Luke's silly scream in <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>) would indicate that he evidently isn't as committed to this vision as he claims, and a cynical observer might conclude that he simply makes things up on the fly because he is short-sightedly afraid his films might look dated.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay">Michael Bay</a> found he could keep no secrets while making <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">Transformers</a></em>, so he subverted it by being completely open. After his computer was hacked, anyway. However, he <em>publicly announced</em> that there would be false leads and red herrings thrown out there in regards to the sequel. Writer Roberto Orci remarked that it seemed most fans could tell the real news from false news, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysSpoil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysSpoil">trailers leading</a> up to <em>Revenge of the Fallen</em> outright disproved Bay's remarks. Bay was more successful in his misinformation for <em>Dark of the Moon,</em> where he stated that fan-favorite Shockwave would be the main antagonist of the film. The result was that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> of the true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(Sentinel Prime, ancient leader of the Autobots and Optimus's former mentor and father-figure)</span> was a huge blow to viewers. While Shockwave does appear in the film, his role is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">sadly short</a>.
</li><li> Prior to the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenDaysOfFuturePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenDaysOfFuturePast">X-Men: Days of Future Past</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BryanSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BryanSinger">Bryan Singer</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Famke Janssen</span>, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">James Marsden</span> all claimed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jean Grey</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Cyclops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Cyclops">Cyclops</a></span> would not be appearing in the film in any way.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorDarkFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorDarkFate">Terminator: Dark Fate</a></em>: In the lead up to the movie, it was announced that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdwardFurlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdwardFurlong">Edward Furlong</a> would reprise his role as John Connor for the first time since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator2JudgmentDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator2JudgmentDay">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a></em>. Connor is instead shown in a flashback played by child actor Jude Collie with his head <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalHeadSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalHeadSwap">replaced with a CGI recreation of teenage Furlong's head</a> and the latter is only credited as "John Connor reference".

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JeepersCreepers3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JeepersCreepers3">Jeepers Creepers 3</a></em>: The writers swore for years that when the film came out, it would finally reveal the Creeper's origins. It did not. While the characters in the film learn, the audience <em>does not</em>. Needless to say after years of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a>, many fans were enraged that they learned nothing.
</li><li> Niki Caro, the director of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mulan2020" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mulan2020">Mulan (2020)</a></em>, stated in an interview that Mulan "isn't a superhero" and they wanted to portray her as a normal woman pulling off realistic feats. In the movie, Mulan is given magical qi powers and is shown performing physics-defying moves that would rival <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">Legolas</a> (running along walls, backflipping off a galloping horse to deflect a spear with her foot, fatally kicking an arrow into an enemy's chest etc). Although she's technically not a "superhero" in the traditional sense, the film still emphasizes that she's got special abilities.

Scott Bakker had said in a few interviews that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbarianHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbarianHero">Barbarian Hero</a> Cnaiür's story was concluded at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SecondApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SecondApocalypse">The Prince of Nothing</a></em> trilogy. This lead many to assume that this confirmed his death. Come <em>The Great Ordeal</em>, it's revealed that Bakker wasn't telling the whole truth and Cnaiür's still kicking it, albeit with much less page time than in the first trilogy. <em>His</em> story indeed seems done with, but that does not mean he can't participate in the story of others.
</li><li> In a playful example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamGoldman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamGoldman">William Goldman</a> presented <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrincessBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrincessBride">The Princess Bride</a></em> as an abridgement of a much longer work by "S. Morgenstern". Neither Morgenstern nor the unabridged work actually exist.
<ul><li> Goldman has layered metafiction on this conceit since the book's publication. The original edition mentioned a missing reunion scene that Goldman felt Morgenstern should have written. He claims to have written one himself, but his publisher refused to include it. Readers could write to the publisher for a copy of the scene; what they got was a letter detailing legal troubles with the Morgenstern estate.
</li><li> By the 25th and 30th anniversary editions, Goldman was teasing about a sequel, <em>Buttercup's Baby</em>, which was also tied up in legal red tape. These editions included notes and a sample chapter for the sequel, and Goldman promised to have the "legal troubles" resolved in time for the 35th anniversary (2009). Sadly, the author was blocked and admitted he hadn't been able to produce anything worthy of the original yet... and sadly, Goldman suffered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">Author Existence Failure</a>, killing any chance of a sequel.
</li></ul></li><li> Most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> fans agree that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenieMeyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenieMeyer">Stephenie Meyer</a> is a liar, since before <em>Breaking Dawn</em> came out she had said that it was impossible for vampires to have children, only for Edward to impregnate Bella halfway through. Meyer insists that while she was deliberately misleading on the subject, she never outright said that a male vampire couldn't get a female human pregnant. Which may be true, but she still lied, as she said it implicitly. And then there's the thing where she <em>had</em> said that when people become vampires <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">in her world</a> all of their bodily fluids turn into "venom". When someone pointed this out to her, she insisted that she <em>meant</em> "except semen."
<ul><li> There is also the case of vampire powers. In an interview, Meyer explicitly states that a vampire's powers come from some trait s/he had as a human. Jasper is an empath because he was particularly empathetic, Alice was apparently already psychic as a human, Edward was intuitive, Emmett was strong... what about Katrina Denali, who administered electric shocks via touch? Or, assuming you'd go with 'shocking personality' for Kat, what about Ben, the Egyptian vampire with <em>control over all four elements</em>?
</li></ul></li><li> Henry James has been accused of this in his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTurnOfTheScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTurnOfTheScrew">The Turn of the Screw</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> stated that this story was simply a ghost story but a few notable critics such as H.C. Goddard have argued that the story is really about suppressed sexuality and the ghosts are a result of the governess' sexual frustration. Marcia Eaton, an aesthetics professor, writes "James himself said that the story was just a ghost story. Some critics ... try to show that he [James] was intentionally deceptive when he made such statements."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TSEliot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TSEliot">T. S. Eliot</a> confessed to doing this with the notes for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWasteLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWasteLand">The Waste Land</a></em>: "When it came time to print <em>The Waste Land</em> as a little book ... it was discovered that the poem was inconveniently short, so I set to work to expand the notes, in order to provide a few more pages of printed matter, with the result that they became the remarkable exposition of bogus scholarship that is still on view to-day."
</li><li> Victoria Holmes, author of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em>, has made many lies to her fans. Some of them are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">listing Hollyleaf as dead on the official website, saying Dove's Wing did not reincarnate as Dovewing, saying Bumblestripe had a crush on Ivypool, and saying that Firestar lost 2 lives in The Last Hope.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em>'s Robert Jordan. "One more book. I promise." Even without his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">death</a>, he almost certainly wouldn't have been able to do it, or allowed to by the publisher if he tried. The series was instead finished by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrandonSanderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrandonSanderson">Brandon Sanderson</a> in 3 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doorstopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doorstopper">books</a>, with him adding numbers 12, 13 and 14 of the series. Officially the last three are one book that was split up so that people can actually carry it out of a store, but all three of them are more or less the same length as the other books in the series, making that justification rather flimsy.

<h3><strong>By Creator:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a> seems to have learned a thing or two from Davies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>.
<ul><li> He made a statement saying that he wouldn't use monsters that only appeared in the classic series by the time he took over RTD in favor of creating new ones. Then came the trailers. Hey, aren't those Silurians? (Rule one: the Doctor lies. Rule two: River Song lies. Rule zero: Steven Moffat lies.)
</li><li> In April 2011, prior to the airing of the sixth series, Moffat announced one of the main characters would die  "We're not lying, we're not cheating. One of those four people is going to die." The Doctor proceeded to die in the series opener <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but was revealed to be a robot duplicate</span>. If you're <em>really</em>, <em>really</em> charitable, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he dies briefly in the middle of the series in "Let's Kill Hitler" by poisoning, but gets brought back to life right after</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue">Rory was also a main character and died too</a>, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyKilledKennyAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyKilledKennyAgain">that's not really anything special.</a>
</li><li> In 2012, he assured everyone that we wouldn't find out anything about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JennaLouiseColeman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JennaLouiseColeman">Jenna-Louise Coleman</a>'s character until Christmas. A week later, on the first of September, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JennaLouiseColeman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JennaLouiseColeman">Jenna-Louise Coleman</a> prominently showed up in the season premiere, though the only things revealed about her character in that episode were a lot of questions. (The Christmas special added even more questions with the reveal that there were <em>at least</em> three Clara Oswalds in different time periods, which can't be identical descendants of each other  the resultant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a> has the Doctor trying to figure out how this is so.)
</li><li> In 2013, Moffat said that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor">"The Day of the Doctor"</a> would feature no <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">classic series Doctors in the flesh (i.e. non-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeShemp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeShemp">Fake Shemped</a> appearances) because they're too old now</span>. This was designated another lie in retrospect: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker">Tom Baker</a> makes a cameo appearance in the final scene as a museum curator who may or may not be a distant future Doctor.</span> He also said <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor">Twelfth Doctor</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCapaldi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCapaldi">Peter Capaldi</a> wouldn't appear, which also turned out to be a lie.</span> Perhaps most importantly, he <em>also</em> said the episode wouldn't involve <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">much, if any, of the show's canon before 2005. In addition to the appearance of the Daleks and the Zygons, both aliens that far predate the series' revival, the entire episode revolves around the restoration of Gallifrey and the Time Lords, which had been missing since the show's return in 2005</span>.
<ul><li> In an interview about the episode, he said, "Normally I am responsible for the disinformation and the rubbish rumours - I usually put them out myself, but I haven't needed to for this one." Of course, the latter part of this was also a lie, as the preceding entry reveals.
</li></ul></li><li> Moffat also followed Davies in claiming that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Master</span> would never return while he was showrunner. In a Q&amp;A at a public screening of the first episode of the season when it happened.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">the Mistress now</a>, not the Master.</span>
</li><li> Which was then nullified when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnSimm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnSimm">John Simm</a>'s Master returned in series 10</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Moffat also claimed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> companion Clara Oswald</span> could never return to the show post-Series 9. BUT <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> because the Doctor <em>tried</em> to save her from her fixed-point death, risking the universe to do so, she's now <em>semi</em>-dead with "wiggle room" to travel on her own for a while before inevitably returning to the moment of her death. Their paths <em>could</em> cross again if Moffat wills it</span>.
</li><li> One relating to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em>: Moffat claimed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Moriarty was very definitely dead</span> after the events of series two. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He turns up at the end of series three, apparently alive and well. However, the following New Year's special strongly implied, and the fourth season made it explicit, that he really was dead and the season's new Big Bad was faking his survival with pre-recorded material in order to troll Sherlock. This plot development may have been planned from the start, or it may have been due to the almost-completely-negative reaction to the idea of Moriarty still being alive from both fans and generalist critics.</span>
</li><li> Happened again with the <em>Sherlock</em> 2016 New Year's special. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He'd flat-out stated it was a Victorian "alternate universe" setting that had nothing to do with the main series' continuity. The Victorian part turned out to be accurate, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screwy</a> ending showed either that the entire Victorian storyline was a drug-induced hallucination of modern-day Sherlock's, or that the entire modern-day series is a drug-induced hallucination of Victorian Sherlock's. Intriguingly, the episode could support either interpretation. In any case, the episode is a direct sequel to the series 3 finale, "His Last Vow", and the end of that episode becomes a plot point for the special.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RyanMurphy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RyanMurphy">Ryan Murphy</a>:
<ul><li> When Idina Menzel was first cast as Shelby on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>, Ryan Murphy said that the character wasn't going to turn out to be Rachel's biological mother as many people assumed (Menzel bears a striking resemblance to Lea Michele). And then that totally happened.
</li><li> He also said that Susan Boyle was going to appear in the Christmas episode as a lunch lady who would get a makeover from Kurt. Then comes the first promo for said episode and not even a trace of her. The episode airs and it seems that plot was completely thrown out. Also Anne Hathaway as Kurt's lesbian aunt and Julie Andrews as Kurt's grandmother were announced by him but never appeared.
</li><li> Murphy also claimed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Finn and Rachel would never break up in Season 2</span>. Guess what happens in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>Special Education</em></span>?
</li><li> Let's not forget that "Blaine is totally just Kurt's mentor, guys. Seriously!" And then comes <em>Original Songs</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kurt and Blaine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveEpiphany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveEpiphany">finally</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade">finally</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">finally</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigDamnKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigDamnKiss">kiss</a>.</span>
<ul><li> Don't get Sam/Kurt shippers started on the "Sam is gay" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> that ended up simply being thrown out before it became canon.
</li></ul></li><li> Ryan Murphy's penchant for lying doesn't stop at Glee, though. He's lied various times about plots in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanHorrorStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanHorrorStory">American Horror Story</a></em>, like when he claimed that Luke and his mother in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanHorrorStoryCoven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanHorrorStoryCoven">Coven</a> were important characters (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he killed off Luke offscreen and with barely a mention and his mother was killed in the very episode this info was revealed</span>), and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ScreamQueens2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ScreamQueens2015">Scream Queens (2015)</a></em>, where he made claimes that were totally disproven by season's end, like 'a regular will die each week' <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> only THREE regulars out of the main cast got killed, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiGi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiGi">Gi Gi</a> (Nasim Pedrad), Earl Grey (Lucien Laviscount) and Pete (Diego Boneta), and those were in episode 9, 10 and 12, and at least Earl was barely a character. Most of the body count was made of minor characters or guest stars brought in only to add to the bodycount</span> or 'only four will survive the season' <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> as explained before, there weren't even four MAIN CAST DEATHS, and as of the first season finale, 'The Final Girl(s)', nine characters - Grace and Weston Gardner, Dean Cathy Munsch, Chad Radwell, Denise Hemphill, Zayday Williams, Hester Ulrich, Sadie Swenson/Chanel #3, Libby Putney/Chanel #5 and probably Chanel Oberlin as a tenth - survived the Red Devils' murder spree</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanSchneider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanSchneider">Dan Schneider</a>: Huge troll, repeated liar.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly">iCarly</a></em>: The week before the "iSaved Your Life" episode aired, a promo aired showing 2 of the main characters kissing. Dan Schneider, in an effort to calm the shippers of a pairing involve a different character, implied it might not be what it appeared. Cue the episode, where they ended up kissing 7 or 8 times, and it was pretty much as it appeared. It went back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a> by the end, though.
</li><li> He also insisted that iStartAFanWar was really a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> at all the shippers for the show, since it had Carly deliver an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">Author Tract</a> about how iCarly is about comedy, not shipping. The next 2 major episodes with promos? 1: Sam admits she's in love with Freddie in the first and 2: locks herself in a mental hospital and after Carly and Freddie can't get her out, Freddie says he likes her too. The next upcoming episode is about Carly reacting to her best friends dating. How on earth that is not shipping-related is beyond a lot of fans.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victorious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victorious">Victorious</a></em> was cancelled when most people expected at least one more season. When it happened, Dan told everyone that it was natural because it hit a '60 episode limit'. This discounts that facts that Dan never saw the cancellation coming, was telling people that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SamAndCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SamAndCat">Sam &amp; Cat</a></em> would keep the Cat character on both shows right until the day <em>Victorious</em> was cancelled and that other members of the cast were "shocked" by the cancellation. The kicker is that he didn't write any series finale.
<ul><li> Not to mention the fact there there are quite a few Nick shows with more than 60 episodes, including Dan Schneider's own Zoey 101 (65 episodes) and iCarly (109 episodes).
</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3><strong>By Series:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski">J. Michael Straczynski</a> openly admitted to lying in response to fan questions about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em> to avoid spoiling storylines.
<ul><li> He also lied about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">real</a> reason Commander Jeffrey Sinclair was written out of the series and replace with Captain John Sheridan. This was due to a promise he made to actor Michael O'Hare to not reveal the truth until after his passing.
</li></ul></li><li> After Starbuck <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">vanished, presumed dead</a>, in the third season of the rebooted <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica</a></em>, Katee Sackhoff (at the urging of creator/showrunner Ronald D. Moore) announced publicly that she was done with the show, displayed a slightly irritated attitude, and was even reported to be going to auditions for a new show — she did, in fact, go on to appear in the short-lived <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BionicWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BionicWoman">Bionic Woman</a></em> reboot. This put enough of the seed of doubt in people's minds that when Starbuck did reappear, it was actually a bit of a shock.
<ul><li> Moore even went to the extent to lie to the cast and crew about her (and filmed the season-finale return in secret).
</li></ul></li><li> The outrage of some fans over <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadLesbianSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadLesbianSyndrome">the trope-naming death of Tara</a></span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> was worsened by the fact that Joss Whedon had said in response to concern that it would happen "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">over</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseReassurance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseReassurance">his</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">dead body</a>".
<ul><li> In the interim between seasons two and three, when asked if Kendra's death would cause a new Slayer to be called, Joss said, "We're going to let it lie. We like the one...in the end, there should be only one." This was after he had already cast Eliza Dushku to play Faith.
</li></ul></li><li> Marc Cherry hinted at tons of future plots for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DesperateHousewives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DesperateHousewives">Desperate Housewives</a></em> that never came to pass. Fans are divided on how many were lies and how many were just him changing his mind later, but one that pretty much everyone agrees was a lie is his statement that one or two of the Scavo kids would die.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> Before RTD and The Moff, there was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnNathanTurner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnNathanTurner">John Nathan-Turner</a>, who famously wrote the title "The Doctor's Wife" on his planner in order to find out if there was a leak to the fan press in his office. There was, but he never found out who it was. Later adopted by (guess who?) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a>, who commissioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a> to write an episode with that title. The section of the fandom that didn't like River Song went berserk  but River did not appear in that episode.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies">Russell T Davies</a> did this many, many times with the new series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>. It became a well-known axiom in the <em>Who</em> fandom to never trust anything Davies says.
<ul><li> For one thing, he once said that he didn't like the Master and wasn't planning on bringing him back. This also caused fans to distrust him when he said something sensible and thankfully true like "It's better not to show the Time War."
</li><li> As with the <em>Star Wars</em> example above, Davies used a phony name, an anagram of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>, during production of the 2005 series to prevent would-be pirates from spotting the tapes.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisChibnall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisChibnall">Chris Chibnall</a> took a different approach and simply released very little information in advance about the plot content of Series 11. The history of this in the franchise meant that hardly any fans believed him when he claimed that the season would not feature any previously existing characters or alien cultures. However, he turned out to be telling the truth... in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a> as the 2019 New Year's Day special, broadcast only a few weeks after the end of the season proper, featured <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a Dalek</span>.
</li><li> As for a lying Doctor performer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker">Tom Baker</a> openly admits that anything he says in interviews "may not be true" and might just be him making things up to waste his fans' time. His Big Finish interview CD, <em>Tom Baker at 80</em>, is even sold with a disclaimer asking listeners to be picky about which parts of it they believe. Part of this is because he claims he has forgotten most of his time being the Doctor  although this claim may, of course, be a lie. Part of this may also be that a lifetime of being interviewed about the same old questions by irritating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">Fan Dumb</a> types force you to start inventing new facts to keep the interviews interesting. Most preeminent Bakerologists hypothesise that <em>most</em> of what he says about his Doctor years is broadly accurate, but embellished to make it more entertaining  the rest is just telling lies for the sake of telling lies.

He's back by the midway point of the season finale.

<ul><li> In one of the featurettes aired prior to the start of Season 1 to introduce the world of Westeros to viewers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeRRMartin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeRRMartin">George R. R. Martin</a> said that "Ned Stark is the main character of the books". Anyone who's familiar with the books were probably laughing their ass off when watching that. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He dies before the end of the first novel.</span>
</li><li> On a smaller note, producers Dan Benioff and D.B. Weiss stated in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary">DVD Commentary</a> for Season 1 that fans shouldn't get their hopes up for a white raven as described in the books, since the rare bird is very difficult to secure for filming. Sure enough, one appeared in the Season 2 premiere, shot long before their commentary.
</li><li> Benioff and Weiss have also lied in the past about certain story lines being faithful to the books. For instance, they claimed that they didn't cast Aeron Greyjoy for Season 2 because they wanted to find someone right for when he becomes a major character. Fast forward to Season 6, and Aeron has been effectively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">Adapted Out</a>, with his name merely slapped on another extra in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">supplementary material</a>.
</li><li> Probably the most notorious example came after the fifth season finale, when Jon Snow was stabbed repeatedly by Night's Watch mutineers and left to die in the snow. Literally <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cinemablend.com/television/Look-Back-Game-Thrones-Actors-Execs-Who-Lied-About-Jon-Snow-135437.html">everyone involved with the show<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> unequivocally stated the character was dead and never coming back. David Benioff and D.B. Weiss gave countless interviews talking about how difficult it was to kill off the character. The president of HBO said he was "Dead is dead as dead as dead." Harington stated <a class="urllink" href="http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/game-of-thrones-jon-snow-dead-finale-season-five-kit-harington-1201519627/">in an interview<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, "Im dead. Im not coming back next season... We did the Tony Soprano walk. And they said, Look, youre gone, its done.'" David Nutter, the director of the episode, even <a class="urllink" href="http://winteriscoming.net/2015/07/11/director-david-nutter-to-president-obama-really-jon-snow-is-dead/">told President Obama<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> when asked point-blank that "Jon Snow is deader than dead." Harington was spotted near the show's Belfast filming location several times during the filming of the sixth season, and claimed he was only appearing as a corpse. Jon was resurrected in the second episode of the sixth season, and the next day Harington told <em>Entertainment Weekly</em>, "I'd like to say sorry for lying to everyone."
</li></ul></li><li> The writers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> were very adamant that Ali Larter's character had been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a> in her big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath">Redemption Equals Death</a> scene mid-way through Volume 4. Turns out that she is not dead and still plot important.
<ul><li> Bryan Fuller had already stated there was a character arc planned for Tracey in an interview before the episode where she supposedly died. Also in the commentary for the episode he stated she wasn't dead.
</li><li> Also, creator Tim Kring was very adamant that, prior to the series, he had no interest in comic books or superheroes. Which is of course why the series is packed to the gills with references to comic books and superheroes, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MisfitsOfScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MisfitsOfScience">Misfits of Science</a></em>, a past show he wrote for, was all about a team of <em>superheroes</em>. I call shenanigans!
</li></ul></li><li> After major fan backlash when season one of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKilling">The Killing</a></em> did not reveal who killed Rosie Larsen, creator Veena Sud was quick to say she never actually said the answer would be given this season. The fans counter-argue that her sitting back and saying nothing while all kinds of interviewers and critics said that exact thing is just as bad.
<ul><li> And also people were expecting the plot to be wrapped up at the end of the season because the original Danish <em>Forbrydelsen</em> had done so.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyleXY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyleXY">Kyle XY</a></em> had lying of a different kind, according to <a class="urllink" href="http://communities.dose.ca/DOSE/blogs/tvcasualty/archive/2009/03/17/kyle-xy-that-s-it.aspx">a Canadian blog<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> about the finale: "As the finale neared, the executive producers told fans that if they ignored the last 30 seconds or so, the episode served as an OK ending to the show. But, in my opinion, that was a crap thing to say. ... I realize that there was no chance to go back and reshoot anything, so the producers didn't have any options, but don't try to placate your audience with false information. It'll just make people more pissed off."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>:
<ul><li> The creators did this at least once, implying that a particular background character would be important in Season 3... while he was mentioned, he didn't <em>do</em> anything. He showed up in a mobisode, however, and then in early season 5, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where he had the show's newest ironic death</span>.
</li><li> They stated that there wouldn't be time travel... in a question about whether there was something relating to time travel in season 2, a season that did not feature any time travel, thus not contradicting the reveal of time travel later.
</li><li> They have also issued <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">Suspiciously Specific Denials</a> of, among other things, that the beach cable lead to an underwater DHARMA station and that the Island could move (saying to a question about the topic that ABC would fire them if they ever came up with a plot twist that crazy) before those plots came up in the series proper.
</li><li> An exact quote before season 3: "Here's what you won't see: Globetrotters, zombies, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy">the guy Meredith Grey didn't choose</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilligansIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilligansIsland">coconut radios</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks">Laura Palmer</a>, Jack laughing, <strong>Desmond running naked through the jungle</strong>, the Others' annual talent show, <strong>buttons, timers, electromagnetic anomalies</strong>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica1978">Cylons</a>, cyclones, or clones, nanobots, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PiratesOfTheCaribbean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PiratesOfTheCaribbean">Captain Jack Sparrow</a>, and <strong>time travel</strong>." (Bold added.) Desmond ran naked in episode 3x03, and was revealed in 3x08 to have been time traveling just before that. And Jack did laugh a little.
</li><li> During season two: "You will get your Libby episode. This season." They also claimed that a Rose and Bernard episode would only happen in a subsequent season. Libby gets killed off before having her own episode, while Rose and Bernard's episode shows up earlier than expected. However, Libby does get a flashback at the end of the Hurley episode <em>Dave,</em> when we learn that she and Hurley were in the same mental institution.
</li><li> Christian was stated to be undead and <em>not</em> a form of the Monster, only to be revealed as the Monster via dialogue in the sixth season. Season six also made it clear, with the finale, that sometimes (and in retrospect this possibly accounts for several of the appearances) it <em>is</em> the spirit of Christian.
</li><li> In an example of Lying Actor, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after his character Frank Lapidus was hit by a steel door on a sinking submarine and proceeded to not appear in the next two episodes with no word on his fate, actor Jeff Fahey confirmed in an interview that Frank had been killed, and that he (Fahey) had already moved on to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Machete" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Machete">Machete</a></em>. Frank went on to show up alive and well partway through the series finale. Fahey lying in order to keep this a surprise is considered by many of the popular character's fans as a Crowning Moment of Awesome.</span>

They even ran an online contest where one lucky "Clone Clubber" won her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">signature parka</span>. As we all learned in the Season 2 premiere, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she survived</span>. To their credit, fans who were lucky enough to catch a sneak peek of the Season 2 premiere - as well as at least one journalist who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">spotted actress Tatiana Maslany in her Helena wig on-set</span> - helped out by not spoiling the eventual reveal.
</li><li> Happened in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PeeWeesPlayhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PeeWeesPlayhouse">Pee-wee's Playhouse</a></em> episode "Front Page, Pee-Wee" when Randy created fake news on the newspaper. Except for the last page (which there will be a big dance in the playhouse).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyLittleLiars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyLittleLiars">Pretty Little Liars</a></em> showrunner Marlene King is basically the definition of this trope. During Season 3, she stated that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Toby was a legitimate member of the A team,</span> when later on it was revealed that he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> was only trying to gather information and protect Spencer.</span> And then the big one in Season 5, when she stated that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mona is really dead,</span> which was later disproven in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a> season finale. She also mentioned that a gay male character would be appearing in Season 5, which never happened. She also makes liberal use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a> when she could get away with it; for example, promising that a particular episode would reveal who killed Alison (i.e. the mystery that had driven the plot for the previous two seasons and change). It did: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the answer was no one because Alison turned out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Not Quite Dead</a>.</span>
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight">The Price Is Right</a></em> announcer Rod Roddy stopped appearing on-camera in the show's 31st season, many assumed it was because Rod was in poor health. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FremantleMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FremantleMedia">Fremantle Media</a> instead said that it was part of a corporate policy that they didn't want announcers appearing on-camera anymore. In reality, Rod's disappearance was mandated by host Bob Barker (who was also executive producer at the time) after he and Rod had a salary dispute. The non-appearances continued through the rotation of substitute announcers after Rod's death and well into the era of his successor, Rich Fields. Drew Carey took over as host in season 36 and about one year later, Rich started appearing on-camera (as does his successor, George Gray), throwing that "rule" out the window completely.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a></em> creator Bill Lawrence and other members of the staff had repeatedly stated that J.D. and Elliot would not end up together, and had written several episodes that showed what a terrible couple they were, that all they really want to do is have sex, and finally brought the relationship to its seemingly ultimate conclusion in the penultimate episode of the third season. Guess what happens in the eighth season. They may have just changed their minds later on, though.
</li><li> An interesting example happened with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheShield">The Shield</a></em> around Season 5's finale. Some spoilers leaked that said Ronnie would die and Lem would leave and go to Mexico. These spoilers mentioned a lot of things that came through in the episode, but were totally wrong about the ending. That's because the creators themselves put those spoilers out.
</li><li> A downright bizarre case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery">Star Trek: Discovery</a></em>, where Aaron Harberts put out a statement that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dr. Culber</span> wasn't really dead, despite his death being confirmed in no uncertain terms in the very next episode. It's largely supposed that he simply panicked at the backlash that resulted from the death and desperately put off dealing with it, even if just for a single week. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then in the next season, it was confirmed Culber <em>wasn't</em> in fact really dead, but it's unclear if Harberts (or anyone else for that matter) knew that at the time.</span>

They went so far as to make up an elaborate backstory about being stranded in a cabin with a four track machine and a copy of <em>Tusk</em>, and tried to really make it sound like it could have been produced in those conditions. The whole project was done to test out how they'd get along in a studio setting after being broken up for years.
<ul><li> The EP <em>Vampire Can Mating Oven</em> has liner notes by a fake critic named Isaac Fringe, full of fictional stories behind the songs - for instance, claiming that "Never Go Back" was written for a 1974 film called <em>Vampire Surfers</em> and that their cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr">Ringo Starr</a>'s "Photograph" was inspired by a period when the group became collectively delusional about Ringo and ascribed fantastic powers such as flight to him.

<ul><li> The very concept of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">Kayfabe</a> made virtually the entirety of professional wrestling a showcase of lying creators by 1920. While fixed and rigged fights were hardly new to sports or unique to professional wrestling, rarely had an entire sport been supplanted by theatrics so completely by covert means. Though nowadays, Kayfabe has been exposed and accepted as necessary for the shows to retain any shred of enjoyability, so this no longer counts.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a> was notorious for piping in cheers and chants over the sound system to try and make guys seem like they were more popular than they really were.

WCW also rigged polls on their website so that any votes towards cruiserweight matches for best of the night would instead officially count for Hogan's.
</li><li> With WCW's demise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> has taken its place as professional wrestling lying creator extraordinaire. Some of it is understandable, such as trying to protect revelations that would kill angles. The office up North is also notorious for leaks so apparently false leads are the best they can do. But they also lie about real life things, and have gone beyond WCW's crowd pipes by censoring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UltimoDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UltimoDragon">Último Dragón</a>'s cheers out of home television broadcasts. They've also gotten a reputation for twisting news and history in ways that would give them the best Public Record, a practice that makes people who actually care about wrestling news assume the worst stories about WWE <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryingWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryingWolf">are the true ones by default.</a> It really goes back further though, the very first WWF champion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BuddyRogers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BuddyRogers">Buddy Rogers</a>, was simply handed the belt but Vince (senior) made up a story about him having won some tournament in Brazil.

It took three years for the ROH bots to forgive them, particularly after TNA agreed to a return only to pull out again in 2006 over a snow storm, which no one bought since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a> came back out of WWE developmental to save the show, only to see TNA do it again in 2007 because TNA didn't like the fact ROH wanted to do i-pay per views. Then it happened <em>again</em> in 2010 when the TNA office threw a tantrum over how ROH was <em>booking</em> the Murder City Machine Guns even though ROH was already giving into TNA's ridiculous demands for their supposedly "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord">independent contractors</a>". TNA was threatened with a lawsuit over the issue in 2012 (by former ROH manager <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DaffneyUnger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DaffneyUnger">Lucy</a>) but managed to settle out of court in 2013. Two years to catch a lie, <em>ten</em> before TNA <em>almost</em> faced consequences. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WSU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WSU">WSU</a>'s Sean McCaffrey, after years of business trouble, made it his mission to expose just how much TNA had misled people.
</li><li> Ring Of Honor's own workers did have open ended contracts in the beginning, and given their own experience, one may think they would have stayed that way; but after the 2011 Sinclair purchase, the ROH contracts changed to be as controlling as WWE's, which led to an incident in 2013 where they tried to bar their "independently contracted" wrestlers from wrestling at Family Wrestling Entertainment events. ROH contracts had became stricter even before this period after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">Ric Flair</a> no showed an event without giving notice, but publicly they announced <em>priority</em> in schedule in contract but otherwise are said they would let wrestlers work where they choose. The 2011 additions were almost immediately opposed by talent and temporarily done away with, but by 2014, ROH contracts were as controlling as TNA's, only slightly less exclusive than WWE's in that dates for other companies can be gotten if an office is informed first and they approve.
</li><li> If you listen to Manny Fernandez's story about the death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BruiserBrody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BruiserBrody">Bruiser Brody</a>, he would have you believe that he went to Puerto Rico, crippled Invader #1, then ran out of the country with a shotgun wielding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HarleyRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HarleyRace">Harley Race</a>. While Harley Race <em>was</em> known for carrying a gun, the wrestler Fernandez beat was Invader <em>#3</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy">who had nothing to do with Brody's death</a>. This happened in 1988, and as late as 2012 Fernandez maintained he never returned to work for WWC. In reality he did on September 28th 1991 where he would fight IWA co-owner Savio Vega (who also had nothing to do with it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedRetribution">but that was the point now</a>), Invader #1 and Carlos Colon in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KayFabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KayFabe">revenge</a>". Of course he lies because that angle was three years too soon.

The most recent one to go was "All <em>Magic</em> cards will have the same card back;" this was thrown out for the "Innistrad" block.
<ul><li> A notable aversion is the Reserve List, a list of over a hundred cards (all of them first printed in 1998 and earlier) that Wizards has explicitly stated that they will never reprint directly or functionally (meaning a mechanically identical card with a different name) as a nod to those who purchase cards as collector's items. Most of the cards would never be reprinted anyway because they're either a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>, or so <em>bad</em> they'd be completely useless because they were developed before creators even understood the game, or use long-discarded mechanics, mainly Ante (where the loser permanently gives a random card of his deck to the winner). Some of the cards, however, are eminently reprintable (Citanul Druid, for example), leading many players to wonder just <em>how long</em> the Reserve List will remain intact, and causing much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">speculation</a> about whether there's any reason for it in addition to keeping their word.
<ul><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Maro</a>, the Reserve List is <em>legally binding</em>, so it's not likely to go anywhere soon.

<ul><li> In 2009, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToddHoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToddHoward">Todd Howard</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">who has become personally infamous for this sort of behavior</a>) stated that there were no plans for a new game in the series. After fan outrage, a statement from Bethesda Game Studios stated that "of course there will <em>be</em> another <em>Elder Scrolls</em> game." This was meant to be taken that the series simply wasn't dead. In mid-2010 Howard stated that they were working on a game that was pretty far along in development. Months later a source stated that a new <em>Elder Scrolls</em> game was currently in the voice recording stage. Not long after, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em> was confirmed. Later interviews and Howards Keynote at DICE 2012 confirmed that the game had been in the works since 2007, making Howard's original statement a flat out lie.
</li><li> In fact, Bethesda had TWO <em>Elder Scrolls</em> games in development since 2007. While Howard's team worked exclusively on <em>Skyrim</em>, they were also consulting on Zenimax Online Studio's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsOnline">The Elder Scrolls Online</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> First, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a>. Before it was revealed in 2011 to coincide with the series' 25th anniversary, a significant number of people assumed that the presence of an official timeline for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> was this trope. Even after it was revealed, some remained incredulous, as some minor issues and contractions still remained. (At which point, Nintendo basically told fans the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra">MST3K Mantra</a>.)
<ul><li> When an IGN editor correctly speculated that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em> would involve Link turning into a wolf, Nintendo denied it with "wanna bet?" to cover up any surprises. The IGN editor won the bet.
</li><li> The N64 game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em> was designed to have things added to it by a disk for the N64DD add-on to the system, codenamed <em>Ura Zelda</em>. This was never released in the end. Years later a special edition of <em>Ocarina of Time</em> was made, called <em>Master Quest</em>, which had the insides of dungeons altered and was otherwise the same. In an odd example of the trope, Nintendo said that this is what <em>Ura Zelda</em> was supposed to be but many fans don't believe it, claiming that Ura was said to change more than this. Conversely, Nintendo might have simply lied about how big the changes for <em>Ura Zelda</em> were going to be. So the assumption is that Nintendo lied...but fans are unsure <em>how</em> they lied.
</li><li> After the Nintendo Switch, then only known by the codename NX, was announced, Nintendo said that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em> would be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a> exclusive rather than a dual Wii U/NX release, only to go back on this later.
</li><li> On a non-Zelda note, Nintendo and Nvidia claimed that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a> will contain a Nvidia Tegra X1 SoC that has been customized to their exact needs. When Tech Insider got their hands on a sample of the CPU and proceeded to analyze the silicon, they found it to be a stock X1 with no modifications whatsoever. On the other hand, it does have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">one customization</a> - Nintendo's otherwise-meaningless custom part number silkscreened on the package.
</li></ul></li><li> For about three weeks before E3 2010, David Jaffe said point blank numerous times he wasn't making a new <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwistedMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwistedMetal">Twisted Metal</a></em> game, and that it was foolish to think that, and that he wouldn't even be at E3. He said he did it cause otherwise there'd be no surprise to it.
</li><li> About two weeks before he was announced for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a></em>, a representative of Sega said that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic</a> appearing in the series "wasn't in the cards."
<ul><li> For the most part though, this was surprisingly averted by Masahiro Sakurai.

Play a Peter Molyneux game, and you will play a simply above average game if that. It's questionable whether this is because Peter Molyneux lies to stir up interest, or because his visions of games are too complex and too expensive to be feasible. He admitted to talking too much to the press about his grand ideas during production, and then having the game not live up to them, in an interview for Project Whateveritis, but has also admitted to making shit up to get the attention of the press.
<ul><li> It's been confirmed that he talks about ideas that are thrown around in development before it is determined whether or not they are feasible by other people working on his projects. It's an issue of him being overly transparent rather than misleading. Molyneux talks about gameplay mechanics at points in development that often occur before many developers would have even announced the game.

<ul><li> Granted, it's not so much "keeping the fans guessing" as it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler">"wanting to end the series, but constantly being roped in for another go."</a> Kojima's been at it since <em>MGS2</em>. He's also gone on record saying that he receives death threats every time he announces that he's ending the Metal Gear series, and no one really knows if that's true.
</li><li> Kojima has stated that the only reason that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain">MGSV</a> doesn't have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a> version because there's nothing he can do with the GamePad, only to announce a few weeks later that the PS4 version will have remote play capability with the Vita and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne">Xbox One</a> will have Smartglass capabilities. Perhaps he's trying to be polite and trying to avoid calling Nintendo's choice of hardware "underpowered", given that he's a fan of many of Nintendo's franchises and is also good friends with Nintendo icon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasahiroSakurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasahiroSakurai">Masahiro Sakurai</a>.

Early screenshots of the gameplay (showing the sequence in Apoina Tower at the start) and press pictures seemed to confirm this. This was a smokescreen to hide Nicholai's true "evil" status and, more importantly, the return of beloved main character Yuri from <em>Shadow Hearts</em>.

Blizzard had previously said that it would not be from an existing IP. They lied. A person on the forums correctly guessed it would be a Warcraft MMO. His message was deleted seconds later, and the forums locked in order to keep the reveal a big surprise. After the reveal, Blizzard claimed no one correctly guessed the game, and named the one poster who came closest. Liars.

So, Mikami didn't "lie" about the port; he legitimately had no plans for a PS2 port, but because Capcom had the final say about it, there was nothing he could do. He did rather over-egg the pudding regarding how he might react, though.

</li><li> Throughout the promoting of WWE12, the game's developers, Cory Ledesma, Marcus Stephenson, and "Tank" all said that a multitude of legends, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage">"Macho Man" Randy Savage</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista">Batista</a>, and most importantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar">Brock Lesnar</a> would not be in the game. However, thanks to people on message boards, it was discovered that all three of these people and more would be in the game, however the developers kept denying that they were, even with the evidence out in the public. The surprise announcement of a remake of the arcade game <em>WrestleFest</em> was also leaked, and they also deny that it exists. Someday, they'll tell the truth.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UbiSoft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UbiSoft">Ubisoft</a> has lied at least once about the presence of their <em>terrible</em> online-only DRM in their games. For example: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FromDust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FromDust">From Dust</a></em> (developed by Ubisoft) stated that DRM would not be present in the game, and, surprise surprise, come launch day, <em>From Dust</em> installed with Ubisoft's DRM.
</li><li> On March 8th, 2013, Square Enix declared that they would no longer make any "social games," instead focusing on more hardcore titles. On April 26, 2013, less than two months later, they announced a social game based off <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>.
</li><li> Ever since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2">PAYDAY 2</a></em> was announced back in March of 2013, everyone demanded that Overkill Software release beta keys for the game. People who got into the game's Secret group also expected a beta due to one of the masks having the beta symbol and the number two next to it. Eventually, Overkill did respond and said they had no plans for a beta release. Towards the end of May 2013, Overkill started to allow people to pre order the game and one of the bonuses included was beta passes.
</li><li> The lead developers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> made many promises that were broken in the actual game.
<ul><li> The Rachni, an alien race the player can save or doom to extinction, <a class="urllink" href="http://popwatch.ew.com/2012/02/28/mass-effect-3-mac-walters/">were said by lead writer Mac Walters<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to have a huge impact on the game's "final battle with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Reapers</a>". <em>You only see them once in the entire game</em> and nowhere near the final battle. As a nod to this, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ExpandedGalaxyMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ExpandedGalaxyMod">Priority Earth Overhaul Mod</a></em> adds a level event where the Rachni aid Shepard in No Man's Land if they were spared in both the first game and the "Attican Traverse: Krogan Team" mission in <em>3</em>.
</li><li> It was said that it would be possible for completionist players to get a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a>", and that said ending would not require any hours to be put into multiplayer. There is no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a> in the actual game, and the closest you can get is a 15-second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">Stinger</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that consists of someone in damaged N7 armor, implied to be Shepard, taking a breath</span>.
<ul><li> Concerning not having to play multiplayer, the game determines your Effective Military Strength (which determines what endings are available and how hopeful they are) by multiplying your war assets by a percentage. The base percentage is 50%, and is increased by playing multiplayer. The most war assets that can be obtained through the base game is 7700, so the most EMS a player who exclusively plays single-player is 3850, and the stinger requires <strong>5000 EMS</strong>. That means it is impossible to get "the best ending" through single-player without modifying your save files. The percentage also drops a few points each day, so anyone who stops playing multiplayer for a few weeks will have to play a few hours to bring it back up. One match takes an average of 20 minutes and will increase the percentage by 3-4%.
</li></ul></li><li> Casey Hudson stated that the endings would "have a lot more sophistication and variety in them", would not be about using a "long lost Reaper off-button", and not be like simple A, B, or C endings. The fans have agreed with them on the latter statement. Instead, they refer to the endings as either red, green, or blue. An ending comparison can be seen <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPelM2hwhJA">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> lie was that the endings would provide closure, that they would be "triumphant and uplifting", and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare">BioWare</a> was not going to "Pull a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>."

</li><li> The Extended Cut DLC has improved some things. It lowered the EMS requirement to 3100, meaning you need a minimum of 6200 war assets to get them without playing multiplayer. All the endings have also been fleshed out with additional dialogue and scenes, the cinematics have been changed to imply less of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">Pyrrhic Victory</a> (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFzrRz6Dc0Y&amp;t=9m40s">the Citadel is left intact and only the rings of the mass relays are blown apart<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, as opposed to the previous cinematics where <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o43tVHs-Ns&amp;t=8m05s">the entire relays and Citadel are destroyed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></span>), and some plot holes (e.g. your disappearing teammates) have been filled. The DLC also adds a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">The Bad Guy Wins</a> ending, which BioWare claimed would be in the game in pre-release statements.
<ul><li> BioWare also lied about the DLC. They repeatedly assured those who were satisfied by the game's original endings that there would be no retcons, only additions.

</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">According to Sega</a>, Sonic and Knuckles' levels and stories take place at the exact same time in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a></em>. Fans cried bullshit since there was tons of evidence within the game itself that Knuckles' story is <em>after</em> Sonic's story. Examples include Angel Island Zone Act 1 showing only the sky in the background instead of the ocean, Eggman's Death Egg is missing in the background for Launch Base Zone and Lava Reef Zone Act 2, the ghosts in Sandopolis Zone Act 2 are already wandering around at the start (you later find the container that held them was already broken by Sonic), and Metal Sonic appears to fight Knuckles at the end of the game since he didn't explode when Sonic defeated him previously. Either Sega wasn't sure about when the stories took place or they just made everything up.
</li><li> When backlash occurred from the always-online DRM in the 2013 version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SimCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SimCity">SimCity</a></em>, EA attempted to calm the flames by saying it was an absolute requirement in order for the game to function, since there were supposedly calculations done on the server side so there wouldn't be too much load on the computers. Hackers quickly discovered this was completely false (the servers function just like any other online multiplayer game) and proved an offline mode was entirely possible with almost no effort. On a side note, there were also claims that the AI would be very sophisticated, with traffic being fine-tuned to find the best paths and every Sim having its own AI. This was also false; the traffic often got very congested because it prioritized short paths over everything else, regardless if the road was clogged or the shorter road was a dirt one instead of a freeway. Sims also would take the path to the nearest home instead of being assigned to one, so if you had one isolated home closer to industries than an entire neighborhood, the Sims would all travel to the one home. This has since been fixed some, but these two reasons are why nobody sides with EA when they claim the online aspect is not DRM.
</li><li> Dennation Games has stated that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HotlineMiami2WrongNumber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HotlineMiami2WrongNumber">Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number</a></em> will be the last game in the series, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a> carries a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a> in the form of a "Hotline Miami 3" title screen (complete with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the remnants of the thoroughly-nuked Miami skyline in the background</span>).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMansSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMansSky">No Man's Sky</a></em> was found to be missing a considerable number of promised features upon release. These include multiplayer interactions, an extensive trading and faction system, ships that have different features and specialisations, siding with specific factions being key to progress and important to develop for certain playstyles, customisation of player appearance, landing on asteroids, a persistent gameworld economy, giant fauna, planetary physics and realistic orbits and being able to simply fly and eventually reach a new system, all of these were specifically and clearly stated by creator Sean Murray to be in the game, even up to the last few months before release.

Then for the October 2018 Halloween event they added a mode with submarines proving fan speculation that the last one was an outright fabrication. For its part Wargaming admitted they lied about the last one because they didn't think fans would appreciate the difficulties the other challenges posed.

Once people got their hands on the game, they saw that not only the models did not change at all from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a></em>, most of the animations were recycled as well on top of the games themselves coming up short both graphics and content wise. And later, even though Gamefreak where adamant on the topic of not adding the cut Pokemon back in at a later date through patches or the like, they announced DLC expansions that would reintroduce some of the missing Pokemon despite their prior statements.

<ul><li> Derrick J. Wyatt got mistaken for this due to "Store 23" featuring present Feedback, despite him stating several times he wasn't in the new Omnitrix. It was actually a diffusion error: that episode was supposed to take place after "Showdown Part 1" and "Part 2" where Ben would reacquire Feedback.
</li><li> He also states that Zombozo was no longer a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">Joker</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a>. When Zombozo shows up in "Special Delivery", he still uses the same Joker-esque gadgets from <em>Ultimate Alien</em> rather than his more supernatural powers from the Original Series. To be fair, his <em>personality</em> is less like the Joker now, although it's also not the same personality he had in the Original Series.
</li><li> Way Big's ability to shoot cosmic rays was stated to be caused by an Ultimatrix glitch that wasn't present in the current Omnitrix. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yet he still uses it against Malware in the arc 2 finale and has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamOWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamOWar">Beam-O-War</a> with a Waybad in the arc 3 finale.</span>

In "Vilgax Must Croak" he plays Vilgax and in "Mystery, Incorporeal" he's also back as Ghostfreak and in the "Galatic Monsters" arc, he's back as Ghostfreak's source, Zs'Skayr.
</li><li> Albedo was stated by Derrick to no longer possess the innate, at-will transformation ability gained in Ultimate Alien, instead relying on an Omnitrix again. In the show however, Albedo explains that he <em>does</em> still have it, and that his Omnitrix-looking device is merely a stabilizer to help him maintain his transformations longer.
</li><li> "Ben 10,00 Returns" is stated to no longer be in continuity. However, while that version of Ben 10,000 is no longer treated as Ben's true future, everything else about the episode is adhered to (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse">The Multiverse</a> and Eon's true nature as an alternate Ben, introduced in that episode, come back in <em>big</em> ways in <em>Omniverse.</em>)
</li><li> While Chromastone's flight ability and Primus's existence are said to have been retconned, Chromastone's one appearance thus far was indoors and nothing has happened with the Omnitrix that would be impossible in light of Primus's existence, though a lot of fans <em>have</em> wondered if we'll ever see Eunice again. It's not a contradiction because we've not seen <em>either</em> way, but basically... by this point it's clear that Wyatt didn't write a show that would make absolutely <em>no</em> sense at all if you missed a single Formspring post of his and were foolish enough to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">take past episodes into account or something</a>, which is what we feared would be the case.

However, at the end of the play, Linda reveals that the killer was her character, pissing off the audience since that means she lied at the start of the play (she considers the lie to be a twist).
</li><li> Prior to the show's premiere, previous "official" information about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DragonBooster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DragonBooster">Dragon Booster</a></em> portrayed Connor Penn (the father of Artha, the main character) and Mortis as two separate people. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, the second season finale contradicted that by portraying "Mortis" as merely being a "secret identity".</span>

</li><li> When Season 9 was coming, Butch Hartman said he wanted to explore Timmy's relationship with Trixie in that season. Trixie ended up becoming a victim of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">Chuck Cunningham Syndrome</a> in that season, only occasionally appearing in group shots, although this may have been due to her VA having retired and Butch deciding not to recast her.

</li><li> Jim Miller was <a class="urllink" href="https://trixiebooru.org/916117">rather adamant that Lyra and Bon Bon weren't a couple<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Since the two's interactions were so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomoeroticSubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomoeroticSubtext">overtly romantic</a> fans either never bought it for a second or adopted the phrase "just friends" or "best friends" to mean "lovers" (or in some cases both). <a class="urllink" href="https://trixiebooru.org/2158574">Sure<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://trixiebooru.org/2158574">enough<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnewIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnewIt">nobody was surprised</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Originally, the reason given for the reason Bulkhead was used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em> was because they were originally going to use Ironhide, but the version they were doing was so similar to Bulkhead from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> that they opted just to do Bulkhead instead. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> On the Season 1 DVD set, it was revealed that Ironhide's death in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersDarkOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersDarkOfTheMoon">Transformers: Dark of the Moon</a></em> was the reason, saying they didn't want to confuse viewers and suggesting the reason given earlier was a lie to prevent spoilers.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>:
<ul><li> Voice actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JesseMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JesseMcCartney">Jesse Mc Cartney</a> claimed that his character, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing">Dick Grayson</a>, wouldn't have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a>. However, halfway through season one it became apparent that he has a crush on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Zatanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Zatanna">Zatanna</a>, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregWeisman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregWeisman">Greg Weisman</a>, the co-creator) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeasingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeasingCreator">has hinted</a> that there might be something between him and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl">Barbara Gordon</a> too. (To be fair, maybe McCartney meant he wouldn't <em>officially hook up</em> with anyone, which he hasn't.)
</li><li> As season 2 approached, fans asked whether there would be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>. Weisman's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a> were that "season 2 would start exactly where season one left off." In the end, you get <em>one</em> short scene set directly after the finale, and then a time skip.

<ul><li> Descartes pondered if it was possible that we live in a universe with a deceptive god pumping images into our brain. It's what caused him to be an all-doubting idealist, leading him to say the famous line "Cogito ergo sum" (I think therefore I am), it being the one thing a person in such a situation would know is true. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix">The Matrix</a></em> is based largely on his writings. He even left some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaselWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaselWords">wiggle room</a> on that seemingly ironclad detail: on the off chance that he does not exist, then that means he cannot exist in the capacity of being wrong.
</li><li> James "The Amazing" Randi blurred the lines between Lying Creator, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">Trolling Creator</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMan">Con Man</a> when he conspired to present his friend Jose Alvarez as the channeler "Carlos" to the world, as detailed in the documentary <em>An Honest Liar</em>. By way of a completely fabricated press package, Carlos became an overnight sensation in Australian media, with numerous television and live appearances. The truth of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhonyPsychic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhonyPsychic">hoax</a> was revealed on 60 Minutes a week later. He did it again with "Project Alpha", coaching a pair of "telekinetics" to deceive serious researchers—who were supposed to be observing <em>Randi's own completely legitimate experimental protocols</em>. Randi, throughout his career as a stage magician and mentalist, tended to explicitly call himself a liar, before he gained a reputation for vigorously debunking any "psychics" (such as Uri Geller) who refused to admit the same.
