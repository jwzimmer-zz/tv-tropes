</p><p>The main reason for this can be so the player has a shot at things like multiple pathways and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">Multiple Endings</a>. Indeed, playing through the game twice or thrice may be the best way to power up so you can face the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a>. A more basic reason is getting over the initial "hump" of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstTown">First Town</a> playthrough. Another possibility is making the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">hopeless boss fight</a> at the beginning of the game anything but, and getting a nice bonus reward for beating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBossPreview" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBossPreview">Final Boss Preview</a>. Plus, it is always nice when you don't have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">grind yourself numb</a> to make the character the badass hero that they are supposed to already be.

You can also just pretend that New Game + mode is playing a new game while averting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring">With This Herring</a> trope since you start off this time with much better gear. On the flipside, the early game becomes a cakewalk unless the enemies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelScaling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelScaling">are beefed up accordingly</a>.
</p><p>In some special instances, going through a New Game + run is the key to fighting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a>, either by taking advantage of options that were not available the first time around or simply because NG+ makes certain changes to the narrative to allow for a fork unique to this run.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI">The Legend of Zelda I</a></em> takes it the farthest. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">The developers flubbed the math</a> and only used up <em>half</em> of the available cartridge space for the game, and so had room to make the second quest an almost entirely new game, with the overworld and actual dungeons rearranged. It's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">harder</a>, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam">Sword Beam</a>-firing Stalfos, ways to <em>permanently lose heart containers,</em> and just generally more dev team sadism. You can also access this quest by just entering "ZELDA" in the name selection screen, which contributed to the origin of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotShazam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotShazam">I Am Not Shazam</a> for this series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeldaIITheAdventureOfLink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeldaIITheAdventureOfLink">Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</a></em> allows you to replay the game from the beginning with all of Link's accumulated experience; once you max out all of your attack, life, and magic levels, any additional level ups will give Link an extra life.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS">Nintendo 3DS</a> remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em> implements the <em>Master Quest</em> version (originally separated in physical form from the original game, despite both being bundled together), as an unlockable mode. In addition to having the dungeons altered, the entire overworld is flipped as in the Wii version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">Twilight Princess</a></em>, and enemies do twice as much damage as before.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames">The Legend of Zelda: Oracle Games</a></em> have a variation on this:
<ul><li> When you beat one of the games, you can input a long, in-depth code to the other version (if you have two Game Boys and a link cable you can just link them up to do so). This allowed you to begin the second game with 4 hearts instead of 3, and very commonly, characters would give you secret codes, which could be used in the first game for some extra sidequests. Not only that, but the second game you play actually acts as a continuation of the story, and includes a different final boss. You can also bring over all the rings you'd collected in the other game.
</li><li> There's also the "Hero's Secret" which is a more typical example. You start either game you played over, with all your rings from before, plus the extra heart even though you're starting at the beginning.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>'s</em> New Game Plus featured Link playing through the game in the blue outfit he starts the game in (at the point where you would get the green tunic, you get invisible clothes instead). Also, text that was previously in the "ancient" language would be translated into English, revealing very interesting conversations (such as when the King of Red Lions boat is talking with Jabu, about Link, knowing he can't understand them). As a third bonus, Link would start the game with the Deluxe Picto Box, making the picture-taking sidequest easier to complete. Beware, though, as unlike most games, you can only replay this one once.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</a></em> has Hero Mode, which carries over the treasures and bugs you've collected (allowing you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting">upgrade your equipment and potions</a> sooner), changes some dialogue (mostly tutorial-related, or to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow">As You Know</a>), allows you to skip all cutscenes from the start, and gives you the fully-upgraded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam">Sword Beam</a> from the beginning, but you take double damage and enemies don't drop any hearts randomly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkBetweenWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkBetweenWorlds">The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds</a></em> also features Hero Mode. If you thought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> wasn't a thing anymore, just know that you take <em>quadruple damage</em> in this mode. Until you get the Blue Mail, a lot more attacks become strong enough to take you down in one or two hits.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansion">Luigi's Mansion</a></em> has the New Mansion mode, unlocked when the game is cleared for the first time. Here, the Poltergust 3000 (Luigi's ghost-sucking vacuum) will be more powerful and be capable of capturing ghosts more easily by depleting their HP faster (this also applies to the bosses); however, the ghosts will also hit much harder. The PAL version (Europe and Australia) adds extra perks for a better incentive: More valuables dropped by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime">Speedy Spirits and Gold Mice</a> so the overall amount of money available is higher (this is necessary since the required amount for the Rank A tier is much higher in this version than in the NTSC and Japanese ones,meaning that it's impossible to reach in the first playthrough), revamped boss battles, Boos with higher HP (or lower HP but being faster), fewer recovery hearts, and the whole mansion being mirrored, among other minor perks. The Hidden Mansion in the 3DS version of the game inherits some of these changes and adds others (relocated Speedy Spirits and most of Mario's possessions, more HP for the Portrait Ghosts and a Platinum tier for their paintings, almost all recovery hearts being replaced by Poison Mushrooms, etc.)
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider">Tomb Raider</a></em> series (with the exception of Chronicles and Angel of Darkness) the player could start a second run with all their weapons, flares and medipacks right after finishing a normal game, on the PSX versions they also unlock a level select option. The second series by crystal dynamics could also emulate a New Game+ option via unlockable cheats, the Reboot trilogy brings back a more standard form of New Game+.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em>
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a></em> has two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game Breakers</a> only available in a second playthrough, the Duplicator and the Ring of Varda. The Duplicator, at the cost of a prohibitively expensive price tag and reduced stats, gives you unlimited usage of usable items and effectively ends all semblance of difficulty once you find a Pentagram. The Ring (and yes, it's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">that</a></em> Ring) is an uncommon but not prohibitively rare drop that gives an absurd boost to all your stats (It boosts your overall attack higher than all except a few of the strongest weapons in the game), and you can equip two of them at once or combine one with the Duplicator to negate its stat penalty.

The approach areas and fortresses are identical to those in the first quest; however, things are naturally more difficult this time around, and the destinations of most of the warp pipes are scrambled (radically altering your path through each fortress).

However, playing New Game+ will not allow you to earn Trophies or Achievements at all. So if you missed any during your first run, you have to replay an older save to unlock (assuming you have multiple saves to begin with). Originally, the Challenge Rooms DLC ($9.99 USD) was exclusive to only PlayStation 3, but as of the <em>BioShock: Ultimate Rapture Edition</em> re-release of <em>BioShock</em> and its sequel, the Challenge Rooms became available for the Xbox 360 version as well specifically through this compilation. The only difference the PlayStation 3 that the version's of the DLC has over the Xbox 360 is that it has extra Trophies.

The fun part is that you can switch between the two playthroughs at any time, meaning that by the end of the second playthrough, you can kill the toughest enemies in the first with a pistol shot to the foot. You'll also be much more likely to face Badass (or in this case, <em>Badmutha</em>) versions of enemies in Playthrough 2, as well as facing more (and tougher) enemies. After playthrough two is completed, the game is ramped up a second time giving access to better quality rewards but without adding another playthrough option or resetting the quests already completed, which makes all those double-powered up versions of one-time only quest rewards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">lost forever</a> (better save those side quests until after the end fight).

A DLC was later released for Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode, which as well as featuring the standard ramped-up difficulty and increased drop-rate of better loot, increased the level cap further turned Loot Midgets into Legendary Loot Midgets, who are likely to drop Legendaries, E-tech relics, and the new Pearlescent items, and allows raid bosses to drop Seraph Crystals for purchasing Seraph weapons.

DLC reintroduces Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode, although the framing story is the same as TVHM, and there are some slight differences from <em>2</em>; the difficulty increase isn't quite as great, and there are no OP Levels, Legendary Loot Midgets, or Pearlescent or Seraph items.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Borderlands3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Borderlands3">Borderlands 3</a></em>, aside from TVHM you can also activate "Mayhem Mode", which boosts the difficulty based on a ranking from 1 to 10 but also dramatically increases drop rate (as well as certain Mayhem Mode-exclusive weapons). You also get to carry over the Eridian upgrades you collected in the normal playthrough, letting you crack open Eridian crystals and decipher Eridian Texts that you were constantly passing by.

To gain access to this class, you must have already played a normal character to at least level 55. Upon doing this, you may then create a Death Knight character, who starts at level 55 in a zone unique to the class, with a full suite of equipment. After you complete that starting zone, though, you enter into the same leveling cycle as everyone else, with the exception that you've skipped all of the classic content.

<ul><li> Unusual in that the reason had nothing to do with rewarding individual players - Death Knights were given a higher starting level both because of their origin story and because the developers wanted the new class to quickly have a presence in the end-game community (as content would now be created with them in mind). Being unlocked by leveling another character was just to prevent new players from skipping the beginning of the game.
</li><li> In addition, <em>Wrath</em> saw the addition of heirloom items, armor and weapons that you purchase at maximum level and mail to alts, which scale with them as they level and are on par with or superior to the best available equipment for the level. To a point, a character will frequently run into cases where an individual piece at or near their current level is superior, and once you got to 80, much of the gear you would be getting was superior. Mostly, it was a way to quickly grind a new character.
</li></ul></li><li> Once you reach a high enough level in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BillyVsSNAKEMAN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BillyVsSNAKEMAN">Billy vs. SNAKEMAN</a></em>, you get the option of looping into a new Season, resetting you to the starting rank and level, but you keep most pickups that wouldn't directly cause <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">Sequence Breaking</a> (as well as a few that do), a chance to change your basic bloodline, and (the first, second, third, and tenth times you loop) unlock some additional content.
<ul><li> This gets turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">up to 111</a> where you hit the cap at Season 111, and receive the appropriately named "Enough Already" Trophy

A player's legacy begins with completing the first "Chapter" of any class's storyline, at which point the player may decide on a server-unique last name which will be given to any and all other characters on the same server as that character. From this point a player begins to earn "Legacy Experience" towards "Legacy Levels" and may also unlock special abilities and emotes, as well as unlocking certain other bonuses, such as EXP bonuses or other convenience bonuses.
<ul><li> Attaining level 50 with a certain race can Unlock that race, allowing a player to play as that race for classes which do not normally allow that race, such as making a Chiss Jedi. Attaining level 50 with a Human (which can be used for all classes in the current game) adds a small Presence buff for all characters.
</li><li> Completing chapter 2 of a class's storyline unlocks the class's buff ability (each class has a unique buff gained at level 1), this buff can now be used on any character within that Legacy.
</li><li> Completing Chapter 3 of a class's storyline (the final chapter for the class-unique storyline) unlocks a special ability which may be used whenever a player's Heroic Moment ability is active. These abilities are usually considered to be powerful or class defining. These moves are said to be learned from other members of the character's "Family", their Legacy.

This is useful in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManPoweredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManPoweredUp">Mega Man Powered Up</a></em>, as you can unlock playable Robot Masters and different versions of Mega Man.

<ul><li> Players are presented with the option to begin a new game on the same save file, and are allowed to keep their ultra-powerful weapons and ammo. Considering how much currency the average player accumulates over the course of the average game (and subsequently spends on weapons and ammunition), this is the only feasible way for most players to get the first game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity Plus One Gun</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">RYNO</a>.

Also occurs in the rebooted continuity of <em>The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night</em> in which completing certain tasks allows you to replay the game with access to the Dark Spyro ability which shortens the playtime considerably (amusingly, Spyro also appears in his "dark" form during the cut scenes).

The mobile release of the original Sonic game saves the emeralds you collect, so you don't have to worry about collecting them all again in one go if you happen to fail the task on your initial playthrough, you can also start a new playthrough without worrying about earning the best ending since you already have all emeralds, finishing the game also unlocks Tails and Knuckles as playable characters, complete with their full move-sets from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles">Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles</a></em> and a few new exclusive areas for them in some zones.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicMania">Sonic Mania</a></em> follows a similar format, after beating the game you unlock the ability to replay any zone you want, with the option to start from Green Hill with all emeralds, or starting with all the characters already rescued in the <em>Encore Mode</em> DLC, there are also extra features for getting enough gold medals in the Blue Sphere <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusStage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusStage">bonus stages</a>, such as the ability to enable the <em>Super-Peel out</em> move from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicCD">Sonic CD</a></em> or the <em>insta-shield</em> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles">Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles</a></em>, as well as a debug mode and <em>&amp; Knuckles</em> option, however you don't need a cleared game to enable these extra options.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros1">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> allows you to play the game with all of the Goombas in the game being replaced with Buzzy Beetles, some of the bigger moving platforms being made smaller, and random bullet bills being added to tree levels that didn't have them originally. In the original NES version, this is accompanied by a level select, but in Super Mario All-Stars, they're treated as another set of worlds (given an asterisk to distinguish them), and so must be played through in order once again, though you can still flip back to any world in the original set on the same save file.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBrosTheLostLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBrosTheLostLevels">Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels</a></em>, if you play through the main game without warping, you access the secret World 9, in which you only have one life and no continues to complete. Furthermore, each time you play through the game, you earn a star. Once you get eight stars, you go to Worlds A through D, at the end of which you finally find the Princess. The <em>All-Stars</em> version averts this, as you don't lose all your lives in World 9 and you can continue after a game over, and you go straight to Worlds A-D after the first loop (in fact, to replay the previous worlds, you need to choose them manually before resuming your playthrough).
</li><li> If you start another game on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em> immediately after beating it once, the game starts with an inventory full of P-Wings, which gives you infinite flight for one level after activating it, then turns into a regular raccoon suit afterward.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioLand">Super Mario Land</a></em>: Beating the game once unlocks the harder mode. Beating the game again after this allows a stage select. But since the game has no saving whatsoever, both of them are of questionable use.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a></em>, if you get 120 stars, you're given the chance to play through the game again- as Luigi. Luigi jumps higher than Mario, but he has an annoying tendency to slide when he stops running. Get 120 stars again, and you'll unlock Grand Finale Galaxy, where you can get the 121st and final star (with both Luigi and Mario).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a></em>, getting 120 stars will unlock the 120 Green Stars, and getting those will unlock the Grandmaster Galaxy. Beating it will unlock "The Perfect Run".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby">Kirby</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysDreamLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysDreamLand">Kirby's Dream Land</a></em>, an "EXTRA GAME" opens up after you've beaten the game (actually, you can get to it at any time, but beating the game tells you the cheat code to activate it). It features harder enemies and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyLevelsHardBosses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyLevelsHardBosses">massively ramped-up bosses</a>, with not only more health, but much faster, more erratic attack patterns. Beating <em>that</em> lets you see an enemy reel.
</li><li> <em>Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land</em> for the GBA (a remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysAdventure">Kirby's Adventure</a></em>) gives you one if you beat the original game 100% (which means finding all the hidden bonus switches), where Kirby has half his normal health. Beating THAT 100% unlocks a mode where you can play the game as Meta Knight.
</li><li> The Meta Knight campaign is also featured in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbySuperStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbySuperStar">Kirby Super Star Ultra</a></em> after completing the Revenge of the King subgame, covering the original main subgames in the SNES version.
</li><li> Extra Mode is unlocked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysReturnToDreamLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysReturnToDreamLand">Kirby's Return to Dream Land</a></em> after you beat the normal mode for the first time. Here, there are much more enemies, bosses have new patterns, attacks, and different color schemes, and Kirby has half his normal health. Also, there's one additional boss fight. Beat that and you unlock the True Arena, a variant of the normal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Arena</a> where every boss is the EX version, healing items are much less effective, and there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> near the end.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted in Tale of Tales' artpiece <em>The Graveyard</em>. You play an old woman who visits a graveyard. The full version of the game is exactly the same as the trial, except, every time you play she may die. The typical "new game" button shows up then, but if instead you prefer to quit the game, you'll find out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> there is no built-in option for that: you have to crash the game from the OS or reset the computer</span>. If you do so, when you enter the game again, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she will still be dead</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostsNGoblins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostsNGoblins">Ghosts 'n Goblins</a></em> and its sequels, defeating the final boss of the first loop gives you the message "this room is an illusion" or something like that, and sends you back to the start with a higher difficulty. To reach the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a> and ending, you must find a certain weapon along the way.
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakIIRenegade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakIIRenegade">Jak II: Renegade</a></em> onwards, <em>Jak</em> players can access Hero Mode as an unlockable extra, in which you go through the game with all your big fancy weapons and power upgrades. In <em>The Lost Frontier</em>, the only game to offer it as soon as you finish rather than shortly afterward, there is a special plane - the Jaguar - that can only be accessed in Hero Mode. Hilariously, unless you are a <em>very</em> dedicated grinder or have almost superhuman ability to streamline your purchases, you will likely be unable to afford the maximum upgrade to the Armageddon <em>even after going through Hero Mode once</em>.
</li><li> Mirror Mode in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountryReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountryReturns">Donkey Kong Country Returns</a></em>, available after finishing the game and completing the bonus levels (including Golden Temple). When playing a level in this mode, all items you collected (puzzle pieces and KONG letters) remain as such, so your goal is to simply reach to the end. Easier said than done, however. Donkey Kong cannot be helped by Diddy or the inventory items, and he only has one HP. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountryTropicalFreeze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountryTropicalFreeze">Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</a></em>, there's a similar mode simply called Hard Mode, which disables all checkpoints and still forbids inventory items, but allows you to play as any of the four venturing Kongs, still retains the collectible items gathered (in fact, it <em>adds</em> the blue-colored KONG letters), and no longer reverses the levels.
</li><li> The WiiWare and Steam versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory">Cave Story</a></em> have Curly Mode, which lets you play through the game as the main character's partner, Curly.
</li><li> If you got gold on every level in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/HarmoKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/HarmoKnight">HarmoKnight</a></em>, the game lets you play those same levels, but <em>fast.</em> (This is optional and only required for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>).
</li><li> The NES <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarus">Kid Icarus</a></em> started the game over but with Pit as powered up as he was at the end of the game after the end credits.
</li><li> The second game of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ApeEscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ApeEscape">Ape Escape</a></em> series had this. Pressing L1+Start on New Game after capturing all the monkeys and beating Specter, would start the game in New Game+. You played as Spike, the player character in the first game, started out with all the gadgets and a secret version of the Monkey Net accessed by pressing R1 on the net in the Gadget menu. You could also get things from the Gotcha Box that you would have to beat several levels before being able to receive in a normal game. (Such as the minigames.)

After completing the main game, the player can play it through a second time, without hints and with access to rooms they couldn't view on their first run. These second runs grant access to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusMaterial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusMaterial">bonus material</a>. From the third game on, the games have instead contained a bonus chapter which expands upon the main game's story, and unlocks the bonus material upon its completion.

It is still possible to do the final combo, which still triggers the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue">Playable Epilogue</a>. In other words, you can restart the game with all catalogs unlocked from the start.

</li><li> If you replay <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PonyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PonyIsland">Pony Island</a></em> after beating it, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lucifer and Hopeless Spirit will call you out on doing this stuff again</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFace">And then there is Louie...</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TowerOfTheSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TowerOfTheSorcerer">Tower Of The Sorcerer</a></em> lets you keep your stats (but not inventory) and play again against a tower where all enemies and powerups have been multiplied by 44. If you have reasonably good stats, this is more or less comparable to your first playthrough, although you may have a slight edge.

However, you will eventually unlock a research subject that gives you the adventure equipment (usable items such as bombs and medicine) from your last playthrough. Additionally, the true ending requires you to have finished the games as both Escha and Logy, making it only available during New Game Plus.

First, in any game you may load characters from a different game, meaning you can load your end-game character at the very beginning of a new game, giving you access to awesomeness from the beginning and letting you level further than the normal game allows. The second way is that if you beat the game on certain modes it will provide you with new characters and also the Extreme difficulty level, which lets you use your end-game characters and has the same creatures as in the other difficulty setting but with levels high enough to challenge you. Level 25 rats, anyone?
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em> exported your character data (equipment and inventory included) immediately after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> goes down. You could then start the game all over again with your leveled-up character. It is fun to try but since you've probably already reached the level cap on the first play-through and the game is balanced so that with a right character build, you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs">insta-gib</a> most starting enemies from the onset, you probably won't need it. That character export is actually intended for you to import in the sequel so you can start with your familiar character rather than having to create a new one.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bastion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bastion">Bastion</a></em>'s NG+ mode lets you keep all of your experience points, weapons and weapon upgrades from your previous playthrough, as well as most of the Vigil rewards (you still have to redo Proving Ground challenges for them to count in your NG+). You can also restore some of the late-game buildings, such as the Shrine and the Vigil, at any time you want. This is also a rare example of the NG+ being justified in game, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the NG+ all but says outright that the Bastion's Restoration function failed to stop the circumstances leading to the Calamity, trapping the characters in an endless cycle of saving the world until things somehow go right or they use the Evacuation function.</span>

Both games has <em>Score Attack</em>, where you get points the lower your level are compared to a boss when you beat it, and Cthulhu adds Overkill (a single battle is enough to get you to level 40) and Highlander (only one character can be in play at any one time, but XP gains are massively raised) modes. The PC version also add an alternate campaign, <em>Cthulhu's Angels</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireDragonQuarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireDragonQuarter">Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter</a></em> took this a step further with its Scenario Overlay system. You can restart, or return to your last savepoint at any time, losing party levels and story progress, but keeping money, equipped items, skills, and stored items. In fact, the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">expects you to lose and restart multiple times,</a> so it uses New Game Plus to make multiple playthroughs easier.

Additionally, in <em>Second</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">this becomes a major plot point. At the end of Chapter 4, the moon is destroyed by Anne and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Ba'als</a> are free to terrorize the world. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a>, restart from the beginning, <em>with all of your memories and powers intact</em>.

This means you can fight the final boss almost anytime, required to get the various endings. The DS version of <em>Chrono Trigger</em> also add <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Bosses</a> that can only be fought in New Game Plus.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross">Chrono Cross</a></em>, this is the only way to get all of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">40+ playable characters</a> at once. <em>Cross</em> also gives you two extra items: one lets you switch Serge for another character in battle which you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantDropTheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantDropTheHero">otherwise can't do</a>, and one lets you speed up or slow down the game speed, which is a godsend. The North American version also added New Game Plus-only boss battles.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkChronicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkChronicle">Dark Chronicle</a></em>, if the player acquired any of the alternate clothes for the characters (which they wear in cutscenes), a new game can be started with any of the acquired clothes, so long as a game save that has them is present on the memory card. You can also save pictures into an album (found in Max's house from Chapter 2 onwards), which can be accessed in any save game where the album is in the inventory. If you save certain ideas and scoops into the album, you can invent and build things that you wouldn't have been able to until later chapters, like the Ridepod's best equipment, or some particularly powerful weapons for Max and Monica.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em> (and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne">Bloodborne</a></em>):
<ul><li> The games all have enemies become noticeably more difficult in the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> run with slight increases in difficulty afterwards, up until your 7th cycle where enemies stop getting buffed up. To make things slightly easier, New Game Plus allows characters to retain all of their equipment (barring key items), stats, and Souls/Blood Echoes, and in the first game bonfires retain their kindling level. In most games, at least three runs are required to obtain every achievement in the game. Depending on the game, NG+ can either just be a harder version of a regular new game (as is the case with <em>Dark Souls I</em> and <em>Bloodborne</em>) or have changes that shake up the game a bit.
</li><li> New Game Plus in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII">Dark Souls II</a></em> doesn't just make enemies harder, it adds more in the form of NPC phantoms, sometimes in the middle of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlunkyBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlunkyBoss">boss fights</a></em>. A very large number of items (including special souls necessary for unique items) are only available from these phantoms or the New Game Plus versions of bosses and merchants. To compensate for this, the game adds the "bonfire intensity" mechanic: by using expendable items called bonfire ascetics, you can make it like a <em>specific area</em> is in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>: all bosses and other enemies that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiGrinding">you killed too many times</a> will respawn and most collectable items are restored, though changes to the map (like unlocking doors or opening shortcuts) aren't reset like if you did a full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>. However, this cannot be reversed and if you go into full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> that area will still be one level higher (i.e. an area you used one ascetic on will be bonfire intensity 2 in New Game, but intensity 3 in New Game Plus).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII">Dark Souls III</a></em>, while it doesn't have as many drastic changes in NG+ as <em>II</em> did, does replace certain items with upgraded forms of rings that you can't obtain otherwise, with the best versions only being obtainable on the second NG+ cycle or higher.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls">Demon's Souls</a></em> starts your character back at the beginning of the game after beating it, with all the stats, items, and equipment you had at the end. However, all the enemies are considerably tougher as well, in a game not known for being very forgiving in the first place. Going through the game more than once is actually necessary (barring the use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">a glitch</a>) to collect all the weapons and spells that exist in order to get some PlayStation 3 Trophies. Subsequent New Game Plus runthroughs, after the first, also increase the difficulty, but not as much as the first time. By your third playthrough, you'll notice enemies are not as tough, and by the fourth playthrough, you're likely to be breezing through the game.

<ul><li> Obtaining certain DLC achievements in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> rewarded you with powerful items, which were given not only to the character who obtained them but also to every new character you create for that account. Which made the supposedly dirt-poor, lowlife characters start the game with massively overpowered artifacts and tons of gold (once you reach the first vendor at Ostagar) in their backpacks. Another small benefit for subsequent play-throughs is that specializations only need to be unlocked once across your account, so the player character can learn any specialization upon reaching level 7, instead of having to find a trainer for the skill (Some of the trainers being being well through one of the main quests, or requiring rather repugnant moral choices to unlock).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> mediated this a little: while the bonus starting items remain powerful, they all cost next to nothing at vendors and quickly grow obsolete, since all loot now scales with the character level.

You are, however, allowed to keep all Party Levels you have already gained (either Party Level 5 or Party Level 6 depending on whether you visited a certain optional dungeon) and also keep all music pieces from the game to listen to in the menu, as well as all Score Pieces from the Score Piece sidequest. Additionally, in the PS3 version, you get to keep all of the alternate character costumes that you've found. You also get to keep the Hero's Crest item that opens up the previously mentioned final dungeon. Finally, playing Encore Mode opens up a number of new sidequests by providing you access to a portal device that allows you to revisit all areas you've been to previously. (In the first playthrough, this device allows you to travel to a particular area to continue the plot, but the part of it that would allow you to travel back to other places is broken down).

A more traditional form of <em>New Game+</em> happens in the <em>Soul of Rebirth</em> dungeon from the <em>Dawn of Souls</em> (and later) remakes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII">Final Fantasy II</a></em> where the main cast would start with all of the stat upgrades, learned spells, and any items that were equipped to them in the main game.

If you mastered the language in a previous playthrough, this makes early scenes easier to understand. It also lets you get the special item from Rin's quest earlier. Furthermore, the non-American released International version of the game contains a glitch in the end-game that allows the player to replay the last third of the story with all their new weapons, powers, and equipment. It is performed by beating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> and then glitching your way past an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPCRoadblock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPCRoadblock">NPC that blocks</a> the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">now-destroyed Al Bhed home</span>.

After playing through the game once, it saves after the cinematics. You can then use the New Game Plus option to starts a new game, being reset to level 1, but retaining all your obtained Dress Spheres, Sphere Grids, Accessories and Completion Percent. This is an essential part of obtaining the Perfect Complete ending (requiring 100% or more) as there is a choice in the middle of the game that limits your game choices. On your first play through one path gives up to 100% completion, while the other gives up to 99.2%. In fact, if you complete both paths completely, you technically get 105%, but the game only lists 100%.

New Game Plus is achieved simply by beating the main game, and while nothing carries over, all characters start at level 90, making the game substantially easier (though not as much as you think, as the game is extremely gear-dependent for damage and defense). New Game Minus is unlocked for completing Trial Mode, and puts all characters at level 1 and have them gain no experience. The completion requirements were removed from the PC, Xbox One and Switch versions of the game, allowing you to choose the New Game Plus/Minus modes from the start.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV">Final Fantasy XV</a></em> gained this after the 1.03 patch, allowing players who completed the game to play it again with all their previous progression, except for story progression and hunter ranks.

This is the only way to complete <em>Golden Sun: The Lost Age</em> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>, as certain items and djinn aren't available in the second game.
</li><li> Completing <em>The Lost Age</em> unlocks the game's Easy mode (you keep all acquired experience) and Hard mode (tougher bosses).
</li><li> If you have a friend with a GBA (or if you have two of them), you could link them together and do a simple transfer. Also, The Lost Age's easy mode isn't too much easier; without your Djinn, your party is pretty weak.

The player's Folio Magi (wizard trading cards) collection is also kept. At least two playthroughs are required to complete the collection since only one of two decks is able to be chosen at the start.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IcewindDale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IcewindDale">Icewind Dale</a></em> series has "Heart of Fury" mode, which was designed for characters that have completed the original campaign. In this mode, enemy stats go through the roof. While it's possible to start Heart of Fury with level 1 characters, successful completion is another matter.

</li><li> The PC version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire">Jade Empire</a></em> has Jade Master mode, essentially allowing you to import the character you finished the game with back to the start with all his stats, styles and techniques retained- but back at level 1 for experience purposes. Weirdly, the initial "training" fight appears to be set up to ignore stats- so a trainee at your character's school can quite happily deal over 1000 damage with a single attack...

This effectively gives you access to virtually every command and ability in the game from the get-go if you're willing to grind a bit on the Water Barrel minigame. The hardest difficulty level "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Critical Mode</a>" also becomes available.

However, the Keyblades are all reset to their base level, including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Ultima Weapon</a>.

But it also buffs the level and experience of bosses and big enemies, sometimes much higher than the characters' stats, so it won't make the game any easier (especially since the party members have a level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">Cap</a> at 99 that can't be surpassed, while the bosses and big enemies <em>can</em> exceed that limit).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ragt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ragt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ragt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Fortunately, the level increase only happens once, so a third playthrough will be the same as the second in that regard.

You also can choose harder difficulties, including Nightmare (enemies' levels are 30 levels higher) or No Future Mode (all enemies are Level 99!). You also get to keep any of the special locations you acquired for your home, like the Workshops and any pets you gained for the ranch.

Also, they can use <em>any</em> of the playable characters to participate in any battle (save for a few).

</li><li> Each game in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> series has this:
<ul><li> Once you have won the game once, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em> lets you start a new game with the same character, inventory, and experience, so you aren't forced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">use a new character when playing on the newly-unlocked Hardcore difficulty</a>. The game even increases the level cap from 50 to 60 for both old and new characters. Similarly, winning again on Hardcore unlocks the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Insanity difficulty</a>, with the same ability to play using an old character. Furthermore, some unlockable bonuses let you give a new character a bonus ability or weapon they cannot normally use—for example, giving assault rifle training to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Adept</a>, or giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">Singularity</a> to a Soldier.
</li><li> The New Game Plus in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> is, to many, of very questionable value. You keep your level, your weapons (including heavy weapons), armour pieces, and you receive 200,000 credits and 50,000 of each resource. Problem is, you don't keep your Paragon/Renegade levels, you don't keep any of your upgrades, and, since the game scales relative to the player's level, the game is significantly harder. The Paragon/Renegade checks are much higher, meaning it is nearly impossible to resolve the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Miranda/Jack and Tali/Legion</span> fights without being close to or at 100% of either level. Compare to starting a new game with a level 60 import from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em>: you start at level five (out of thirty), already have a decent number of Paragon and Renegade points, have <em>350,000</em> credits, and <em>60,000</em> of each resource. Worst part? <em>The 200,000 credits and 50,000 of each resource are available for all new games once the game is beaten.</em> It's actually best for you to just play your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus">Old Save Bonus</a> again.
</li><li> Beating <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> allows you to start a New Game Plus using a previous save, which starts you off with your level, weapons, armor, and weapon mods you've obtained in that save, as well as increasing the weapon level cap from 5 to 10.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a></em> keeps the theme going, the player starting a new game with Ryder still using all the weapons, armor and mods they acquired. It'll take two-and-a-bit New Game Pluses just to get Ryder to the full level cap (of 137), and max out all their abilities. Unfortunately, the game implements <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelScaling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelScaling">Level Scaling</a>, making additional levels of questionable use at best.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiDreamTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiDreamTeam">Mario &amp; Luigi: Dream Team</a></em> gives you Hard Mode after you beat the game. All enemies become stronger, the time window for pulling off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionCommands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionCommands">Action Commands</a> becomes smaller, and you can only hold up to 10 of each item.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelUltimateAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelUltimateAlliance">Marvel Ultimate Alliance</a></em>: The game allows you to load characters from your other save files when you start a new game. Good thing, too, as you will have a hell of a time getting through hard mode with fresh characters. Costumes and unlocked characters are also retained between playthroughs, which is quite useful given that some can only be unlocked at the end of the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER3">Mother 3</a></em> has a strange form of <em>New Game+</em> via a glitch, sometimes by copying your first save file into the other save slot, then starting a new playthrough over it, has the possibility of the previous data from the last game not being erased properly, you get to maintain Lucas' equipment for the duration of the prologue (leading to the comedic side-effect of seeing an younger Lucas dealing massive damage), and Salsa's equipment during his chapter, however if you unequip any of these items, they dissapear permanently, certain equipment also doesn't work properly, as weapons like the Real Bat don't give the PP boost that is supposed to give. There is, however a good side-effect, Kumatora and Lucas get to keep all of their learned PSI attacks throughout the whole game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShouldntKnowThisAlready" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShouldntKnowThisAlready">even before Lucas actually learns any PSI abilities.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights">Neverwinter Nights</a></em> allows you to export your character at any time during the game, to be used in other modules. But you can also start a new game again in the main story using your leveled up character. The game does spawn tougher enemies in the early game if you use a character that isn't low level, but if you've reached a high enough level they aren't a real challenge.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NieR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NieR">NieR</a></em>'s New Game Plus allows the players to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">understand the Shade's speech as well as hear Tyrann</span> along with the usual extra endings. The result is that it makes the entire game a mix between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard">You Bastard!</a>. It also starts you at the half way point of the game. Nier and the others will also comment on weapons received through playing the main quest that he already has because of the New Game+.
<ul><li> The New Game+ playthroughs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/NierAutomata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/NierAutomata">NieR: Automata</a></em> lets you carry over all the experience, equipment and cash you earned as well as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">giving you a new playable character with each subsequent playthrough</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NocturneRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NocturneRebirth">Nocturne: Rebirth</a></em> requires the player to either beat the weaker version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> at level 40 or less or beat their stronger version at any level.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdinSphere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdinSphere">Odin Sphere</a></em>, you can replay all of the character's stories (and the last one) after they've been completed. Considering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">how difficult it can be</a>, it's probably a good idea to do this.
</li><li> Once <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PandorasTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PandorasTower">Pandora's Tower</a></em> is completed (regardless of the ending triggered), it's possible to not only restart a new playthrough on the same file, but also choose from which part of the game to do so. The first option is the beginning, the second starts with the sixth tower, the third starts with the eleventh and the fourth and last starts with the finale (but since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Elena is taken by force right after the completion of the 12th tower</span>, it won't be possible to get a different, thus better, ending to that gotten in the first playthrough, so this last option is pointless unless the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a> was already unlocked). In addition, Mavda will put into sale numerous new items, including gifts to keep increasing the affection with Elena, as well as a special key that can open all of those red doors in the towers that could never be opened in the first playthrough, giving access to rooms with unique treasures.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParasiteEve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParasiteEve">Parasite Eve</a></em> has new game plus in the form of EX Mode. EX Mode starts you off with the weapon and armor that you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICallItVera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICallItVera">gave names to</a> in your previous play through, which are extremely overpowered for the start of the game. The mode also has you racking up BP at each new day so you can power up your items even further. EX Mode also unlocks the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Chrysler Building</a> which is made up of 70 floors and 10 bosses, along with a super boss which gives the true ending if you beat it. You can beat the game in EX Mode as many times as you want and power up your gear to their capped levels.
</li><li> Frequently averted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>, though some games provide workarounds that allow you to invoke this trope:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2">Pokémon Black 2 and White 2</a></em> feature a New Game+ option in the form of the Key System. This allows players to select "keys" which set which legendary golem is obtainable, if their game will have Black City or White Forest, and most notably, set the difficulty of their game. However, only certain keys are available in each game. Black 2 features Hard Mode, Black City, and the legendary golem Registeel, while White 2 features Easy Mode, White Forest, and the legendary golem Regice. Players could unlock the keys from a different version by linking with the other copy.
</li><li> The only way to preserve your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll">collection</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mons">mons</a> is to trade them into another copy of the game, and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pokémon Black and White</a></em>, you can't even do <em>that</em> until beating the first Gym in the new copy. However, there are some exploits that let a player create a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> style experience: 1) Use TMs in the old game to teach powerful moves to the new guys before trading them in. 2) Use Pokémon from the old game to mule items and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash">Vendor Trash</a> over to sell. Since the game gives you the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Dragon trio's</a> Orbs for free, you can send them across (assuming your Dragon trio has theirs already) and sell them for a cool P15,000. Full Restores also make a good store of value for transferring your endgame money, since they are the most expensive purchasable and tradable item at P3,000, and sell for P1,500. 3) Since they're traded, your new team will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrind">Level Grind</a> faster, though this can be a problem early on, as their levels will outstrip your badge collection and cause disobedience.
</li><li> It is possible to do in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">the first generation</a>, with the help of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonStadium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonStadium">Pokémon Stadium</a></em> or <em>Pokemon Stadium 2</em>, which allow you to store Pokemon on the console game and transfer them easily. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">second generation</a> games have to wait until they've caught 150 species of Pokémon before taking transfers from different cartridges, and the console-based storage programs for all the later generations locked out the option completely. The more optimistic way of thinking would be that this was because Game Freak thought having an easy method of mass-transferring Pokémon within a generation would be too much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>; the more cynical perspective would be that they wanted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevenueEnhancingDevices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevenueEnhancingDevices">force people to buy the game again if they wanted to replay without losing everything</a>.
</li><li> A feature called Pokémon Bank got introduced in Gen 6 to allow people to store massive numbers of their Pokémon and carry them to different games, which can be used to enact this trope. You can't transfer items this way, though.

The second was the New Game Plus mode, where you started from the beginning, but with all your demons, inventory, level, etcetera—however, your partner would be returned to its first stage, so doing this over and over again is the only way to see all its stages. <em>Finally,</em> the game offered you a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue">Playable Epilogue</a>, which not only <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> brings all your friends back from the dead</span>, but allows you to get <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">muddafriggin' SATAN</a></span> as one of your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mons">Mons</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> had a new game plus that is considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gamebreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gamebreaker">Gamebreaker</a> by fans of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a></em> series (which is normally considered much more difficult than other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPG">RPGs</a>) by the virtue that the new game starts with the main character at the level he was in the final save, all his weapons, money, and a record of all the Personas that have been created.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a>, <em>Persona 3: FES</em>, allows the player to import the main character's status (his non-combat skills, that is), any items gained from maxing out a social link, and a record of all personas registered in the compendium. Needless to say, this made maxing out social links the second time <em>much</em> easier, as well as saving a <em>lot</em> of time building up personal skills. <em>Persona 3 Portable</em>'s New Game Plus also includes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the option to choose which person you spend your dying moments with at the end, provided you maxed their Social Link and for the Female Protagonist, made it romantic.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a>'s</em> new game plus only allows the player to keep his money, characteristics, persona compendium, and the max social-link items, starting him at level 1 as always. This essentially renders Izanagi-no-Okami (the ultimate persona of the game) a useless novelty, since the player would STILL need to grind to level 91 to actually summon it. However, while you can't fuse high level Personas right off the bat because of your low level, the compendium has <em>no such limits</em>, so if you've got the cash (and if you've finished the game with a lot of money, you'll have enough) you can go ahead and summon that Trumpeter with immunity or better to everything you fused last game. (You still have to grind for Izanagi-no-Okami since you can't actually fuse him until NG+, however...and he can't be registered in the compendium anyway).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em> keep your social parameter stats, Persona compendium, cash, and equipment.

</li><li> Many people are unaware that the version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona2">Persona 2</a></em> released in the USA (<em>Eternal Punishment</em>) was actually the second half of the game, and if you played through the first half (<em>Innocent Sin</em>), you could import your Tatsuya character to EP with his stats intact (not possible with anyone else for obvious plot reasons). His last name, if changed from its default (Suou) would also change for EP, along with changing his brother's last name to the one that you chose. However, since the PS1 version of <em>Innocent Sin</em> was never brought over, the feature was removed in the American version of <em>Eternal Punishment</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigitalDevilSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigitalDevilSaga">Digital Devil Saga</a></em> lets you keep your mantra grids. So you might actually have a character with all mantras mastered...if you money grind like mad for 2 or 3 playthroughs. There are also extra bonuses in each game - In the first, you would then have the option to fight <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Demi-fiend of <em>Nocturne</em></span> at the end of the game, while in the second, you unlock Hard Mode if you didn't get it as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus">Old Save Bonus</a>.

Also, beating the Grave Run and going to the first Burial Chamber in a New Game Plus would give the Demi-Fiend an extra Press Turn.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiStrangeJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiStrangeJourney">Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey</a></em> lets you start with your money, weapons, compendium, unlocks new apps and lifts the level cap for fusion. It also unlocks three new quests: A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Boss Rush</a> where you fight the seven major bosses and then, depending on alignment, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mastema, Pillar Zelenin, Soil Jimenez, and/or both forms of Mem Aleph</span>; a quest for treasure that leads to fighting <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alitat</span>; and a follow-up to that quest where you fight <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Gnostic Demiurge</span>.

Some quests are unlocked only in specific paths in a new playthrough
</li></ul></li><li> This is done in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicChronicles">Sonic Chronicles</a></em>. You have to unlock all the characters again, but you can re-choose their stats and abilities they they would have earned up to the level they are at. The main point of this particular game is that you can take different dialogue choices, and use different characters without worrying about having the best party for each particular area.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTillTheEndOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTillTheEndOfTime">Star Ocean: Till the End of Time</a></em> has a special, separate save that is made at the beginning of the game for battle trophies. When the player collects a certain number of battle trophies, they will unlock new rewards. Since this file exists as a separate save, the player can take on a boss multiple times, first to get one trophy, then resetting the game after the battle and fighting the boss again for another. During subsequent playthroughs, the player is allowed to carry over their battle trophies..
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenIV">Suikoden IV</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenV">Suikoden V</a></em> also have included the option of a New Game Plus, though SV's is more of a bonus. While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenIV">Suikoden IV</a></em> only lets you keep money and items in your inventory at the end of the game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenV">Suikoden V</a></em> let's you keep not only those, but Party SP (though oddly enough, not the personal SP of your characters, which is reset to 0), items in your storage, epic skills you've acquired, formations, the various skill manuals (which allow your party's combat and magic trainers to raise your skills to higher levels) and even allows you to run faster than normal when holding the Triangle or R2 buttons. The only downside is that neither game transfers over the equipment or runes your characters had currently equipped (everyone has their normal default equipment instead), which is quite obviously the best stuff you'd have. Also, weapons are all back at level 1.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SummonNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SummonNight">Summon Night</a> Swordcraft Story 2</em> features a New Game+ system that basically carries over everything that won't break the game. You get to keep Craftknight rank, fishing points, money, you get some cool extras depending on what you did in-game, as well as an equip at the beginning that raises the amount of EXP you get. You don't get to keep your level for some reason(if you're taking advantage of the New Game+ system here to begin with, you really don't need to), but to make up for it, inside the Fire Fortress are 5 chests; these chests can store 5 weapons of your choice, as long as they weren't made with the Gem of Light. So basically, you can store your incredible elite weapons that can take down the final boss in 20 seconds for the future you to gush over, and proceed to murder the last 2/3 of the game with. Much exploitation then follows.
</li><li> The "Grade Shop" is a staple of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries">Tales Series</a></em>. A player's performance in battle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoringPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoringPoints">earns either positive or negative amounts of Grade</a>, and a player's Grade total can be spent at a Grade Shop when starting a new game. These typically include bonuses a player can buy like increased experience gained, carrying over items, armor, and skills, as well as perks like more Grade and higher item capacity. A few of them also make the game more difficult, such as reducing experience earned. New Game Plus-only dungeons have become pretty common in the series as well.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em>'s New Game Plus allows players to keep the previous game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">Relationship Values</a>, recipe ratings, techniques, etc., or raising/lowering grade and experience growth rates.
</li><li> On the second playthrough of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss">Tales of the Abyss</a></em>, each character gets a second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Mystic Arte</a>. A couple sidequests and dungeons also open up, and you have to play through at least twice to get one hundred percent completion (as there is one sidequest where you choose what reward you get, and two aren't found anywhere else).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfBerseria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfBerseria">Tales of Berseria</a></em> has a few Grade bonuses that change the level system a bit, such as changing what stats increase depending on which title the character has equipped. Also, the player can choose to carry over items like the venite and glacite which provide in-battle bonuses, and carry over items that allow the player to warp out of a dungeon or to a town at no cost, provided they found the items on the previous playthrough.
</li></ul></li><li> Multiple variations in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TitanQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TitanQuest">Titan Quest</a></em>. Like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a></em>, <em>Titan Quest</em> allows you to take the same character through three different, successive difficulty levels. In addition, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a> adds a 'transfer stash' that allows you to transfer items between completely different characters. This can result in a melee character finding a good bow, placing it into the transfer area, and starting a new game as an archer character. Assuming the archer meets the items' requirements, he/she can then start out the game much more powerful than he/she could have had they been the player's first character.
</li><li> The RPG Maker game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGrayGarden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGrayGarden">The Gray Garden</a></em> has a few minor bonuses on the second playthrough (aside from the <em>Bonus Room</em>), such as not having to collect any apples in Apple Park to proceed, a <em>666 ticket</em> item in Froze's house that summons a passing demon to help in battle, a side area in the Evening Forest that was formerly blocked by plants will also unlock, a Mogeko there will give Yosafire the choice to get her party fully maxed out and receive rare Prosciutto equipment which makes an already fairly easy game into a total joke in terms of difficulty.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wadanohara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wadanohara">Wadanohara</a></em> after clearing the three main endings you unlock a <em>Bonus Room</em> in the next playthrough, located in Wadanohara's room, it is very similar in format from the other games created by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeepSeaPrisoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeepSeaPrisoner">Deep-Sea Prisoner</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Torchlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Torchlight">Torchlight</a></em> lets you start over after beating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>. The first re-start opens the infinite dungeon. Every re-start lets you improve one item and gives you one free fame level (skill point), plus the same storage that lets you pass items between characters works across the generations.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em> inverts this: you can reset the game at any time, and the characters' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory">Ripple Effect-Proof Memory</a> will result in dialogue changes up to whatever point you had reached, depending on your actions. Only by seeing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a> can you do a "True Reset" and <em>not</em> carry over this information.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VagrantStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VagrantStory">Vagrant Story</a></em> allows the player to restart after beating the game; Ashley will have the same stats, weapons and armor he had at the end of the last playthrough, and is also given the ability to unseal the 'rood inverse' doors that were locked during the first run, allowing access to various bonus dungeons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile">Valkyrie Profile</a></em>:

Each crystal makes the enemies slightly harder.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfileCovenantOfThePlume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfileCovenantOfThePlume">Valkyrie Profile: Covenant of the Plume</a></em> requires you to get all three endings to unlock the bonus dungeon. You also get to keep skills gained from granting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath">Final Death</a> to your allies, as well as any of your endgame equipment, and equippable and usable skills, and you gain up to 2 additional skill slots for every character with each additional playthrough.

It also gives you the opportunity to defeat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> at various points in the story for additional endings; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says this was directly inspired by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em>. However, one stipulation is that certain treasure chests (mainly those containing the rare crystals and Nightmare Dimension rewards) do <em>not</em> reset, so you can only ever have one copy of their contents. This is likely because four copies of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">Luminous Armor</a> would be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidequest">Sidequests</a> don't reset either, so you can't farm the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Bosses</a> or the pig arena for their special equipment.

</li><li> Possible in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms3">Wild ARMs 3</a></em> as long as you collect at least two EX File Key items during the course of the game.

Geralt starts with all the gear he acquired, apart from Gwent cards, bestiary entries, and plot relevant alchemical recipes. The initial equipment is scaled to his level, as are all the enemies in the game.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AWitchsTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AWitchsTale">A Witch's Tale</a></em>, the entire first playthrough is a dream brought on by Queen Alice to test Liddell. The New Game Plus is the real adventure, and contains story elements not seen in the first one.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou">The World Ends with You</a></em> has a version of New Game Plus that's even better than most: once you've beaten the final boss, you can jump to any chapter of the story at any point, even if you're in the middle of a different chapter, with your level, your items, your pins, your friendship levels, and so forth intact. They also let you skip through conversations at super-speed by holding down a button. Which is helpful, considering how talky most of the characters are. And since you can pick your partner at any time that you're not in battle and take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity Plus One Equipment</a> that you only get at the end of the game into earlier chapters, <em>WEWY</em> 's New Game Plus takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a> to a whole new level. For example, you can play as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Joshua</span> in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the first week</span>, even though you don't meet him until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the second week</span>, or easily demolish bosses in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless Boss Fights</a>...only for the following cutscene to depict your characters as getting their behinds handed to them!

You're also given <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">The True Monado</a></span>, which is the single most powerful weapon in the game. However, the game warns you that it's a one time only item. Meaning, if you clear the game again without having it equipped, or unless you opt to carry it over to your next game, <em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">it's gone for good.</a></strong></em> Also, a New Game+ file allows you to carry over a set number of equipment and earn additional affinity coins, but all heart-to-hearts, sidequests (including the rebuilding of Colony 6), and the in-game achievements will have to be redone.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a></em> included this feature in an update patch. You carry over party levels, skill tree progress, all Blades except the generic tutorial Blade, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Roc, Aegaeon, Nia, and Poppi's upgraded forms</span> and their skill tree progress, items and money, area Development Level, Mercenary Ranks, <em>Tiger! Tiger!</em> score and levels, and Unique Monsters defeated. You can deploy any Blade on Merc Missions, even ones normally required to be on your team at all times. You also have access to unique skills, specials, and bonuses, the ability to <em>decrease</em> levels, and special shops that sell items limited in the regular game. Additionally, you can recruit several special Blades only available in NG+, including the Blades used by the Torna members and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">some of said group <em>themselves</em></span>. However, quests, skip travel points, heart-to-hearts, quest Merc Missions, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rex's Master Blade ability</span> don't carry over.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XMenLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XMenLegends">X-Men Legends</a></em> allows you to pick different "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes">skins</a>" for the characters after the first playthrough. Meaning you can have Wolverine in his yellow spandex, or even a human Beast. The pictures and in-level cutscenes will reflect any costume changes you make.

That's right, nine endings. The only thing that makes this sort of a New Game Plus however is the first level changing two times when the mode is completed several times.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius">Gradius</a></em> games have New Game Pluses in the form of multiple "loops"; after beating the game once, you start over again, with the game at a higher difficulty level.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Raiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Raiden">Raiden</a> IV</em> must be played through two loops to access the true final stage and boss. "Light" difficulty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyModeMockery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyModeMockery">only allows you to play the first loop</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RadiantSilvergun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RadiantSilvergun">Radiant Silvergun</a></em> has Saturn Mode, which, given the superior hardware of the Saturn (as opposed to the ST-V original), adds in voice-acting, cutscenes, extra bosses and what have you. Relevant to the trope, though, is how it saves the levels of your weapons — <em>Silvergun</em> powers up your weapons depending on how many points you rack up with them, and higher levels are far more powerful — allowing you to start a new game with fully-powered weapons, making the game a bit more of a breeze. However, continues are not allowed.
</li><li> If the player completes <em>Hydorah</em> the surviving space-navy personnel are shown celebrating. Starting a new game thereafter provides the player with shields, doubling his hitpoints from one to two... but starting a new game right away changes the intro. Initially your commander gives an short inspiring speech as your fightercraft leaves the mothership. In a immediately-started new game he is disheveled and can't form an unslured, understandable sentence.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ExZeus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ExZeus">Ex Zeus</a> 2</em> allows you to purchase upgrades and power-ups for Minos and they carry over in subsequent playthroughs.

This also unlocks Free Mission(s) — fly any mission in the game, any difficulty (that you unlocked), and if you're looking for that elusive "S" Rank or an Ace kill, it counts towards your campaign unlockables! (You only have to play the Campaign to <em>buy</em>/sell those unlockables, and to get the money for that).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackAndWhite">Black &amp; White</a> 2</em>, completing the game allows the player to start over while retaining access to all the building designs, miracle options, and other abilities that they accumulated during their first playthrough.
</li><li> In the iOS/Android game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GameDevStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GameDevStory">Game Dev Story</a></em>, after completing a 20-year campaign, you can start a new game with the same levels for the genres and game types that you had with your previous game, as well as points accrued toward game direction. Everything else (staff experience levels, consoles, etc.) has to be unlocked all over again, though, since you're starting over as a year-one studio.

Your child starts with the cash you have plus a 10k bonus, level 3 skill in all tools, and most portable goods (like furniture), but not livestock or the buildings themselves.
</li><li> <em>Animal Parade</em> has one as well, but you don't start over as your child (genetics would get hairy); instead your child goes and meets a new rancher on a new, identical island. But cash and items don't carry over; you start with full stamina, Goddess-level watering can and hoe, and <em>one singular item</em> from your old game. And the <em>one singular item</em> is only if you gave your child a gift before they left. If you didn't give them one, (you can probably read that as you didn't know you could) then there's no real link to the first game at all.

All playthroughs after the first use a more difficult "Enemy Deployment 2" version of each mission, but in Training you can select which enemy deployment you wish to play against.

You can start the game with up to two items that you have unlocked in the past, and any unused Pedigree Paper you earned in the past is not erased (other items however gets wiped). However, unlike <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GameDevStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GameDevStory">Game Dev Story</a></em>, any training you have given your hired jockeys remain permanent so that if you do hire the same jockeys, you don't have to train them again.

Get both endings, and you can playthrough the game the third time in a tuxedo, plus keep both special items (and, for some reason, the color scheme on the Cyborg Ninja's armor will be different). The sequels only ramp this up further, often with even tougher requirements.

However, the digital camera allows you to save the images to your memory card instead. It also features, in addition to the stealth camo and bandana from the last game, a series of wigs that Raiden can wear to gain the same effects as the above, plus giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperNotDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperNotDrowningSkills">Super Not-Drowning Skills</a> or infinite grip while hanging, acquired by holding up a certain number of guards and getting their dog tags.

You can also start a new game with Ocelot's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolversAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolversAreJustBetter">Single Action Army</a>, assuming you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">picked the right gun in the duel at the very end.</span>

Killing all the bosses non-lethally and collecting dolls after their fights also awards the player with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Boktai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Boktai">a weapon powered by sunlight</a>.

For those who didn't, it was quite the shock to lose the weapon you've spent the entire game building up. Likewise, all weapons, armors, and items that Wayne held onto you will also be carried over in your next new game plus the next time you spoke to him. This was practically one of the few ways to power up your equipment if you were planning to tackle the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Chrysler Building.</a>

</li><li> Most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> games allow you to start with an extremely powerful gun once you unlock it, usually by clearing the game really fast, with a very high score.

Each has two different scenarios, all stemming from which way the car at the start crashes. To begin with you can just play Claire A or Leon A, both of which show the character ending up on the left hand side of the crash. Beating Claire A gets you Leon B, while beating Leon A gets you Claire B, showing what the other character got up to during whatever A game you just beat. The game is also affected by what decisions you took in your A game, for instance, picking up a pouch that allows for extra items to be held means it's not there in the subsequent B game. The B games have different bosses, and a few more enemies here and there. Doing well in these and getting a top rank unlocks some new weapons to be found in chests, each with unlimited ammo. Furthermore, completing all of these (beating the game four times), unlocks The Fourth Survivor mode, a minigame where you guide an Umbrella agent named HUNK through the Raccoon City Precinct to the helipad on the roof. This isn't so much a New Game Plus, but rather a new mode, recycling old level data, but it's worth noting that doing well in this unlocks a new character, Tofu (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">which is literally a giant block of Tofu</a>), who serves as something of a Hard Mode for this already hard bonus, as while Hunk is armed with several guns, Tofu just gets a combat knife and a couple of herbs.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising2">Dead Rising 2</a></em>'s New Game Plus is similar to the first game's, as the only things that carry over is money, level, combo cards, and keys.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killer7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killer7">killer7</a></em> gives players the chance to revisit any and all previous levels after beating them, with all the character upgrades the player has gained until that point. However, at the end of the game the player can no longer generate serum for character upgrades, so their levels are locked in place for individual level replays. Beating the game, however, unlocks <em>killer8</em> mode, which lets you start over with an even higher difficulty level than before, as well as a new selectable player character, and beating <em>that</em> unlocks <em>hopper7</em> mode, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillinessSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillinessSwitch">allows you to play the first level with most of the enemies swapped with giant grasshoppers</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace">Dead Space</a></em> goes so far as to have "Round 1" marked on the save slot during your first playthrough, as well as awarding some nice bonuses for game completion that can be used in round 2. And believe us, ripping through the game's early enemies with a fully upgraded Line Gun is <em>incredibly</em> satisfying.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace2">Dead Space 2</a></em> lets you change the difficulty when you start your next round, allowing you to jump into Zealot difficulty with a full arsenal and a store full of extra ammo.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace3">Dead Space 3</a></em> allows you to start over with your custom weapon from the previous playthrough, as well as opening up a lot more upgrade options.
</li><li> After beating <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFrame1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFrame1">Fatal Frame</a></em> in Normal Mode and getting the canon ending you unlock Hard mode with a bonus ending.

These save files display the protagonists' face sprites with a small orange cross in the corner.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheEvilWithin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheEvilWithin">The Evil Within</a></em> allows you to carry over all weapons, ammo, green gel and stats from your first playthrough, along with doubling all new green gel pickups to make upgrading even faster and enabling a chapter select option. The only catch is that you're locked in at or lower than whatever difficulty level you picked; if you cleared the game on Casual, you'll have to start over fresh on a harder difficulty to unlock <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> for it.

This causes the game's first arc to be an accelerated version of the events of Unlimited in which Takeru liberally "cheats" with his experience and knowledge of the future... up until him using said knowledge to prevent one of the incidents that happened in the previous game causes some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">unforeseen consequences</a>, at which point the timeline diverges and his remaining knowledge of the future becomes worthless.

You can replay the Island/School Mode any number of times; the number of Free Time Events already seen is carried over, as are the characters' leveled-up skills at collecting resources.

Also any upgrades will be carried over between the two modes. <strong>However</strong>, enemy configurations will be changed (meaning that you'll see tougher enemies sooner rather than later), enemies themselves get tougher and more aggressive. Also, you get no counter indicator. In other words, New Game+ is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> when compared to the regular game. Not to mention this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> can only be used on normal and hard difficulty, you can only have a single New Game+ per save file and can't start it over again and to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>, you need to finish all other sidequests in both the main file and the New Game+.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamOrigins">Batman: Arkham Origins</a></em> makes a slight change; all gadgets need to be reacquired, but their upgrades still stay. Additionally, the game has a second NG+ called 'I am the Night' mode which is even harder, as you only have one life, but thankfully it doesn't have to be completed in one sitting- the game has autosaves that kick in at predetermined points so long as you don't die.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamKnight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a></em> continues the tradition, and even adds to it. Now, you'll lose your fear takedown charge if you are seen in predator, and you get bonus points in combat; The latter can even be turned on in challenge maps, turning off counter icons but allowing higher scores.
</li><li> The bright side of NG+? You can use the big head mode and extra costumes without beating the story. However, Big head and Skins can be toggled in Knight without any limitations other than requiring a certain patch.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DriverSanFrancisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DriverSanFrancisco">Driver: San Francisco</a></em> features one after completing the main story which allows you to fully explore the entire city with your highest level of shift and abilities and carried over your vehicles, garages, willpower points, ability upgrades, etc.

All your learned abilities carry over, as do unlocked costumes. Playing through again with the Joe Fixit skin (which makes the Hulk quip and snark constantly, but you probably won't unlock it until after the story) has the bonus of Joe/Hulk making comments during boss fights and such.
</li><li> It's not pointed out, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria">Terraria</a></em> has an informal new game +. Due to characters and worlds being separate, it's possible to start a new world with an end level character capable of flattening all the easy mode, the pre-boss world, enemies there. Can also be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">done in reverse</a> and start a new character in a hardmode world, possibly set up so nothing is unlocked before the world is forced into hardmode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMansSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMansSky">No Man's Sky</a></em> does this rather sneakily: Upon completing the game's <em>goal</em> of traveling to the centre of the galaxy, the game warps you to the edge of a new galaxy, with all your unlocks available, and your gear in need of repair. Furthermore, the AI in the new galaxy have far greater intelligence than before, and the planets you visit are mostly dangerous, upping the difficulty level. To top it off, this can be repeated again and again, visiting more and more galaxies with each playthrough.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HorizonZeroDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HorizonZeroDawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a></em> does this with a twist: your New Game+ inventory can be determined at any time after completing the final story quest. As such, you can either go for New Game+ right away or complete <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">The Frozen Wilds</a></em> to get its gear to prepare for an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Ultra Hard</a> run. In New Game+ proper, the prologue as young Aloy is skipped, you can earn special Adept equipment, and the difficulty setting is locked.

</li><li> Winning <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/SafeCracker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/SafeCracker">Safe Cracker</a></em> involves beating the computer opponent and entering the Vault, whereupon the player is rewarded with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchThemAll">collectible token.</a> If you use one of these tokens (instead of a quarter) to start a new game, you can play "Assault On the Vault," which gives you 90 seconds and four balls to hit as many targets and shots as possible.
