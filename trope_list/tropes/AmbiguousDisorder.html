</div></div><p>This character's behaviour is bizarrely outside the norm — it's <em>way</em> beyond mere <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander">ordinary quirkiness</a>. No reasons are given for the strange behaviour. No specific diagnosis is ever mentioned in the story. In fact, any resemblance to any real disorder is likely accidental; the character's symptoms are exactly those symptoms the writer wants them to have. It is a case of Ambiguous Disorder.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>The disordered behaviour will often be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>. This technique is generally used to avoid writing yet another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatientOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatientOfTheWeek">Patient of the Week</a> story about some specific disorder and to focus on the laugh-producing elements without having to deal with the serious issues. Or, less generously, to mock the kooky outer aspects of mental illness without the risk of getting angry letters.
</p><p>In the instances where this trope is played seriously, the character usually overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpock">The Spock</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinocchioSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinocchioSyndrome">Pinocchio Syndrome</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinMan">Tin Man</a> and the focus is on this character's struggle to befriend people or otherwise fit into society.
</p><p>A lot of mentally ill people in classical literature, especially from the 19th century and earlier, tend to be this; psychiatry was a very young field back then (and, until a certain point in history, didn't exist at all), and so there was no manual to turn to if you wanted to give your character odd quirks. Even if an author did <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">do the research</a>, psychiatry has changed greatly and rapidly, meaning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">their work is very likely to be invalidated by the passing of time anyway</a>. Also, the lack of psychiatric expertise during these periods means that many historical figures might have had undiagnosed conditions (<em>vast</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">Wild Mass Guessing</a> exists about this topic). Even today, due to difficulties in pinpointing an exact diagnosis, this is also often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. That said, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/NoRealLifeExamplesPlease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/NoRealLifeExamplesPlease">No Real Life Examples, Please!</a> We don't want to start any sessions of "armchair diagnosis," since that kind of speculation about real people inevitably leads to controversy. Also please note that in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, most mental health diagnoses require that the behaviors the diagnosis purport to explain contribute significantly to impacted functioning in one or more domains of daily living. Plenty of people behave oddly from time to time without meeting the criteria for any major mental health diagnosis, and Occam's Razor applies to the diagnostic process. Personality quirks and variations are perfectly normal, even if they may seem very strange or downright unrelatable to outsiders. <strong>Basically, as a rule of thumb: If your behavior doesn't significantly and negatively impact your quality of life, well-being and desired relationship with others, you don't have a mental disorder.</strong> Additionally, if the observed behaviors are best accounted for by an explanation that does not invoke a major mental health disorder, clinicians generally don't invoke a major mental health disorder.

<ul><li> Marv from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinCity">Sin City</a></em> is often considered stupid and insane, an opinion that he shares. He did poorly in school, has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">No Social Skills</a>, gets "confused" a lot, and often has violent blackouts, although he has mentioned fighting in a war and suffering from traumatic symptoms. In his first story, he mentions that he has always been good at puzzles, implying that he's capable of solving complex mysteries. He was certainly intelligent enough to go up against a powerful crime family. He also cares a lot about his friends and family, is friendly towards complete strangers, and is something of an awkward gentleman with women. On the other hand, he often displays bizarre emotional responses, most prominently a near-sociopathic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy">Lack of Empathy</a> — there have been multiple instances of him remaining <em>genuinely</em> perfectly calm during moments of intense chaotic violence, and he's capable of cool, calculated cruelty and a complete lack of queasiness or discomfort while casually torturing people to death (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch">not that his victims didn't deserve it</a>).
</li><li> Cammi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Annihilation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Annihilation">Annihilation</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersArena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersArena">Avengers Arena</a></em> seems incapable of feeling empathy and has absolutely no verbal filter. Numerous characters remark how incredibly bizarre this behavior is for an 11-year-old girl.
<div class="indent"><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nova">Nova</a></strong>: Oh, this is Cammi. She says out loud stuff most people just think.
</div></li><li> Brian of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/KnightsOfTheDinnerTable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/KnightsOfTheDinnerTable">Knights of the Dinner Table</a></em>. He has a job that involves running an online service from his home (which he is said to not clean) and painting model figurines. He has a savant-like memory of obscure roleplaying game rules, yet sometimes forgets his own phone number. He is stated to become very uncomfortable when any social group exceeds four to six people, especially when it happens away from the context of a shared interest. He rarely speaks unless dealing with gaming, and has a face and body language that is usually unreadable. And finally, some things that would annoy other people seem to have no effect on him at all, while something that others would take in stride can send him into a sudden and brutal fury, typically involving flipping over the gaming table in rage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em>:
<ul><li> Nico is shown to have issues dealing with stress, loss, and rejection. In the first story arc, she mentions having "this thing with stress and eating". Later, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Karolina leaves to marry Xavin</span>, Nico sits in her bedroom, with a pile of her clothes scattered around her. She later notes that she has a tendency to throw herself at "the nearest warm body" when she's upset or confused (kissing Chase after a near-death experience, even though he's dating Gert, reacting to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gert's death</span> by sleeping with Victor, etc.) All of the characters act in different ways to cope with the stress of growing up as the children of supervillains, but Nico is the only one who feels her behavior is unacceptable.
</li><li> Later member Klara talks to plants, is prone to weird moods, and occasionally blurts out appallingly rude things. Whether her behavior is due to her traumatic background, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfTemporalWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfTemporalWater">Fish out of Temporal Water</a> nature, some sort of neurological issue, or just a consequence <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">of the inconsistent writing</a> that plagued the series in its later arcs has never been explicitly stated.
</li></ul></li><li> It was implied for years that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan">Hank Pym</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></em> likely had some sort of mental illness, as he displays obsessive behavior, sometimes goes through violent mood swings, and is prone to frequent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames">identity crises</a>. After years of this, Marvel finally dropped the "ambiguous" part and made it canon that Hank suffers from bipolar disorder.
</li><li> Rufus Whedon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LockeAndKey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LockeAndKey">Locke &amp; Key</a></em>. He's definitely "special" in some way, but he seems too articulate to be handicapped or have Downs. His first appearances made him appear to have some sort of disassociative identity disorder (he only talked through his action figures) but later ones had him talk on his own and say that was just pretend.
</li><li> Sonic from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheComic">Sonic the Comic</a></em>. He cannot express his feelings well, which results in him bullying and acting cruel even towards his loved ones. Back when he was younger, he was asocial enough to rely on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHuman">Token Human</a> of their world (instead of other animals) for companionship. Sonic also seemed to only care for running when younger.
</li><li> Herbie Popnecker from the <em>Herbie</em> comic is extremely uncommunicative, has no interest in social interaction of any kind, usually shows absolutely no visible emotions, and seems utterly indifferent to what other people think of him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyclops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyclops">Cyclops</a> is introverted to an unhealthy extent: the people he interacts with outside of work can be counted on one hand. This trait is compounded by his difficulty with expressing emotion and extreme dependency on his few close friends - <em>all</em> of whom, not coincidentally, are telepathic. Everyone else perceives Cyclops as colder than he actually is. Growing up with a deadly superpower that could kill anybody you <em>look at</em> unless you wear special glasses will do that to a man.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TwilightGuardian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TwilightGuardian">Twilight Guardian</a></em>, the titular heroine is obsessive about her patrols, goes to absurd lengths to protect her secret identity, and is convinced that her comic books are sending her messages. It's frequently mentioned that she used to be on medication (which she has long since stopped taking) but it's never mentioned what specifically the medication was supposed to treat.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2000">Batgirl (2000)</a></em>: Cassandra Cain has been claimed as neurodivergent by some writers and certainly seems like it, but it's ambiguous as to how much is credited to the canonically confirmed parts (dyslexia and a bad upbringing) and how much is something more. Among other things, she's extremely socially awkward, frequently obsessive, acts on impulse, taciturn even in terms of the little language she does know, and seems highly sensitive to attention. James Tynion IV, her writer in <em>Detective Comics</em>, has refused to nail down anything on the basis of not wanting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAutism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAutism">make her a stereotype.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarveyComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarveyComics">Harvey Comics</a></em>: Little Dot, whose entire personality revolves around the fact that she is obsessed with polka-dot patterns (and by extension, virtually anything circular), to the point that she paints dots on everything, even other people's property. Her only rationale for her impulsiveness is "dots are beautiful". She gets upset to the point of distress if her handiwork is removed or ridiculed, as in one story where Little Lotta pointed out numerous things that were troublesome despite being dot-shaped.

The narrator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonSmartass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonSmartass">Jericho</a> has one of these. While his behavior is often kooky and generally silly (like monologing his life aloud), at times he gets downright evil (being mentally unable to comprehend how beating a girl into unconsciousness was wrong). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> states Jericho has a real condition, but the author refuses to admit what it is.

</li><li> A recurring theme in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/GenderConfusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/GenderConfusion">Gender Confusion</a>, during one arc, is the author attempting to find a credible diagnosis for some of the characters using <em>Zetsu</em> as the resident psychologist.

<ul><li> When Yukari had gone insane, remaining like that for about two stories, she was prone to wandering around, which occasionally involves searching for Ran like a lost pet, screaming at random periods (whether or not that is part of it is left up in the air), going ballistic at a moment's notice (according to Amoridere), rambling, and generally incoherent most of the time. By the time of Gensokyo 20XXV, she seems to have regained her sanity, aside from the bouts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOohShiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOohShiny">Attention Deficit...

It was also noted that she seemed to have some sort of psychosis, which is made more apparent in chapter 115, where she starts clawing at mirrors, claiming to see messages in them.

At one point the narration lampshades this by explaining how his friends honestly think Naruto has an undiagnosed attention disorder.

Lewis' parents took him to many, many psychologists and psychiatrists as a child, trying to figure out exactly what was going on with him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says they eventually concluded he had <a class="urllink" href="http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/dissociative-identity-disorder-multiple-personality-disorder">Dissociative Identity Disorder,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> but his mother Beatrix eventually realized that there was more to it.

She seems to be aware of her changing emotions, however, and she appears to be able to at least control it to the point she doesn't go from loving to murderous around those few she really cares about. This may have originated from having grown in an abusive home in a heavily polluted part of a polluted city, though given the mood swings of her possible uncle Capriccio, genetics may also play a part (though none of her other possible relatives have shown these behaviors.)
</li><li> The aforementioned Black of <em>Pokemon Adventures</em>, in this case, Black Gaiman, shares his canon selves odd behavior pattern and need of a psychic type chewing on his memories to focus on them. Without the focus, he talks fast and needs prompting from White to stay on task. However, when his mind is focused he is highly observant and clear.

This obsession led him to hate Death the Kid, seeing him as a symbol of what he could not have. Inversely, when Gopher dresses him up as Maria, Noah seems to genuinely think that he is Maria.

He also reacts to being touched by his boss, his reaction to a door slamming shut being similar to sensory overstimulation. Along with his often social miscues noted by Ganabati. To further complicate it, he's been noted to scream out at night from Noodle Incident of Romania that Ganabati describes as having been...horrific.

He is obviously high-functioning, competent, intelligent and even intellectual, but <em>something</em> is definitely not right about him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ValesUnderground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ValesUnderground">Vale's Underground</a></em>: Officer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY">Penny Polendina</a> is a rather strange individual. She has trouble picking up on social cues and tends to blurt out inappropriate things at times that might not be the best without thinking. She's incredibly friendly and wants to make friends with everyone, but she's not very great at conversing with others. She also has a fascination with macabre things and is <strong>way</strong> too willing to share it. The writer says they didn't have a specific disorder in mind when writing her and encouraged any readers to try to diagnose her.

She's been destructive and antisocial since childhood, which leads to her peers rejecting her. Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend">Only Friend</a> is Nyamo and even then she doesn't completely trust her. Yukari turns to drug usage, which soon spirals into addiction. It's also mentioned that Yukari gets much of her personality from her mother (who is so bombastic that even her husband prefers to avoid her).

Sunset goes through periods of depression, as well as periods of mania. In her depressed state, she displays lethargy, suicidal ideation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfHarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfHarm">Self-Harm</a>, and a lack of self-care. She's had these symptoms for years, maybe even dating back to her time in Equestria, but can't afford therapy.

Amoridere did state in the end note that whatever is wrong with Ragyo or Satsuki (who is suffering from a kind of psychosis in the former's POV) when the perspectives are flipped, is anyone's guess.
</li><li> Satsuki in <em><a class="urllink" href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/6938392/chapters/15898753">The Mysterious Lady Kiryuuin<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> is implied to have some kind of a disorder, likely one relating to social anxiety, considering that she is so <em>painfully</em> shy and seems to have some agoraphobic traits, considering that going outside scares or, to a lesser degree, upsets her. There's also the fact that she doesn't interact with her new house-guests directly and her mother's ghost described her as "fragile in mind", along with having been like that since she was a child. However, while her condition is, to some extent, debilitating, it doesn't keep her from being a caregiver to her younger sister, Ryuuko, and a child she adopted, Nui.

She can pretend to be emotional, but describes herself as feeling "flat", and finds her feelings to be shallow. She also dehumanizes herself a lot. Terra frequently calms herself by imagining herself dying violently and also had suicidal thoughts.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhenMarnieWasThere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhenMarnieWasThere">book</a> starts with her acting incredibly detached from other people, enjoying spending time alone, limiting interactions with the family she lives with, and sending postcards to her guardian that are only a few sentences long. She views the world as being a circle with people on the "inside" and on the "outside", believing herself to be on the outside and separate from everyone else. At one point, she goes into a fury over an insult which everyone, even the narrator, considers to be silly. She also doesn't seem to have many friends, but the people she does meet and bond with (Marnie <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and, later, the family that moves into her house</span>) she's able to form very close ties to. Some of her behavior can be attributed to her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">fearing that her foster mother is only keeping her for the money</span>, but her reaction to that still comes across as unusual for an upset child.

He still has no friends and no idea what he wants to do with his life - after all, he prefers lying in his parents' swimming pool to going out into the Real World. Harold, unlike Benjamin, <em>actively resists</em> interaction with other people. For example, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFetishist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFetishist">enjoys horrifying girls with fake suicide attempts</a> whenever his mother sets him up on a date.

He was a very early reader as a child, and in a deleted scene Hee-bong recalls Gang-du reading from a calendar when he was never taught the Korean alphabet. He also has a specific interest, but that interest is in his daughter and being a good father to her, even though he's hapless at it. He has no medical history of a mental disorder, but it's likely that his family hadn't been able to afford a diagnosis for his behaviour.

Many have theorized that Todd has signs of autism or some kind of developmental disorder due to his undeveloped, almost deficient social skills. On the other hand, having a sociopathic monster as an uncle and father figure (Jack), it is almost inevitable that he was going to develop a ruthless side anyway.

He has Eidetic Memory, which means he remembers every little detail about everything. He also shows a disturbing lack of empathy, obsessive behavior, and an unusual number of phobias. Sheldon also displays some form of synesthesia- certain sequences of numbers glow red to him, and he claims to be able to taste the speed of light. Additionally, Sheldon is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatureOfHabit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatureOfHabit">a huge fan of incredibly strict schedules and rules</a> and has even made a timetable containing his and Leonard's allowed time in the bathroom, much to Leonard's dismay, since he's ONLY allowed to go to the bathroom during those three timeslots. Aside from that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">he feels a constant need to control everything</a>, to the point where Leonard had to sign a several dozen pages long Roommate-agreement and later a just as long <em>Neighbour-agreement</em> and Amy had to sign first a friendship-agreement and later a relationship-agreement. He also consistently displays narcissistic behaviour, having convinced himself he is the smartest in the group, and completely dismissing any other member's achievements. Even when one of them <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> becomes an astronaut</span> he still maintains he is the most esteemed member of the squad. Oh, and he's kept literally everything he's ever owned, locked up in a storage facility.
</li><li> Leonard rather noticeably struggles with keeping eye contact in a conversation and fidgets with his fingers constantly. Besides Raj (who is unable to speak in front of a girl) he is the one with the most trouble actually trying to communicate in an unfamiliar social environment. Unusual for this trope, these things are downplayed as the series progressed, factoring a lot of his issues into his low self-esteem at the beginning and showing a great deal of personal growth.
</li><li> Raj was shown to be almost biologically unable to speak in front of a woman without some sort of anti-anxiety medication or alcohol to calm his nerves. This ended up actually being, well, diagnosed in the second season by Leonard's mother as selective mutism.

Some of her <em>oddity</em> stems from the show playing her demisexuality for laughs.
</li><li> Before Amy was introduced, fans saw Leonard's mom as a "female Sheldon". She's cold, detached (to the point she's only ever had sex to procreate and Leonard was forced to build a <em>hugging machine</em> that his dad borrowed), has no problem with treating her son as a test subject and embarrassing him (despite, ironically, studying and understanding human behavior is her <em>job</em>, which also makes this a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCobblersChildrenHaveNoShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCobblersChildrenHaveNoShoes">The Cobbler's Children Have No Shoes</a>), and several weird Sheldon-esque traits such as demanding her coffee be made a certain impossibly specific way and announcing "I have to urinate" every time she gets up to go to the bathroom. From dialogue, it's possible her own mother deliberately held her back from socializing with other children when she was growing up or else, Beverly was born the same horrible person she is in the show and was never once in her life interested in socializing because of Avoidant personality disorder and instead dedicated her life to science and studying.

<ul><li> Viserys: First, there's all his mood swings which range from intense calmness to manic twitchiness. There's also his uncontrollable rages, bouts of depression, and extreme self-delusion. His sister Daenerys says that the worst of it only started after they were forced to sell their deceased mother's crown to survive, but considering he's the son of "Mad King" Aerys Targaryen and there's an in-universe saying that the Gods flip a coin when a Targaryen is born as to whether they'll be destined for "insanity or greatness" this makes sense, and centuries of incest probably haven't helped.
</li><li> Daenerys shows no emotion while watching her brother <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">be killed via molten gold to the head</span>, and later unflinchingly <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ties the woman who killed her son to Khal Drogo's funeral pyre</span>. From there on, she's shown as being extremely focused on her goals, occasionally to the point of foolishness (for example, badgering merchants for ships, without considering that she has no way to pay for them). While she certainly shows more empathy for those in her care than Viserys did, including putting her own goals in jeopardy for the sake of freeing slaves on several occasions, she also is shown to be capable of violently dealing with anyone who tries to hinder her without showing any signs of being bothered. A major source of dramatic tension with her character is what side of the coin for the Targaryens she'll end up being.
</li><li> Joffrey, a product of incest himself, displays a disturbing fondness for violence. At times he even seems to be <em>sexually aroused</em> by it. He shows no signs of empathy whatsoever, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil">is extremely impulsive</a> (ordering a crowd of peasants slaughtered because someone threw a cow pie at him), derives joy from inflicting random cruelty on others, and is convinced that everyone loves him.

Despite having a relatively successful career as a teacher, she had an odd habit of seducing her son's friends if they were mean to him and her method of getting a promotion was to lock the other candidate up to try and bring on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperOCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperOCD">Super OCD</a> attack.

Also, if most Doctors manage to hide/ignore their PTSD, this one (coming right off of <em>900 or so years</em> spent just defending one little town in his previous life) certainly doesn't — he has a marked dislike for soldiers with only a few exceptions, doesn't want to be seen as an officer either (preferring that anyone who does anything to help him exercises their free will rather than just following orders), and questions his own actions, especially his mistakes past and present, surprisingly often.

<ul><li> Obviously, young Bruce Wayne is not in the best headspace after watching his parents get killed right in front of him, but there's something else going on with him that's distinct from the trauma. He demonstrates hyper-awareness and has some obsessive-compulsive tendencies, he has difficulty relating to and socializing with children his own age, and his speech patterns are overly formal and precise, bordering on unnatural-sounding. And we viewers know that these tendencies are only going to deepen as he gets older and resolves to put them to use.
</li><li> Nobody knows what's up with Ed Nygma (the future Riddler), but even by Gotham City standards, this young man is extremely eccentric.

After he gets sprayed with it, though, he becomes even more sociopathic than Jerome. While Jeremiah, himself, believes that the insanity toxin didn't really do more than bring out long-repressed criminal tendencies in him, perfectly normal people who were exposed to a more potent version of it were first driven to mad laughter, and then driven to attack anyone standing too close to them, so it's possible that the toxin just damaged his mind so much that he lacks the self-awareness to realize how much he's changed. He was either a sociopath before his exposure to the gas, or hes suffering from some kind of toxin-induced brain damage that causes him to act like one, but it is never made clear on the show which interpretation of him is right. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast">Considering that the Jokers past has traditionally been a mystery</a>, the writers may have kept his characterization purposely ambiguous.

He eventually dates a woman who is <em>explicitly</em> on the autism spectrum. She lampshades this by mentioning she can't tell if he's autistic or not.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurdochMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurdochMysteries">Murdoch Mysteries</a></em>:
<ul><li> Murdoch's interests tend toward a specific type of scientific bookishness, coupled with a mechanical aptitude, as opposed to literature or sport (though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">he has recognized quotations from Shakespeare and played sports well enough on occasion</a>).

Later in the series, he speaks positively about the anonymity of living in a hotel, since it allows him to avoid "useless" conversations with his neighbours. Some of his personal conversations (even those with his beloved Julia) end abruptly when he sees something that brings his mind back to his current case, and he hastily takes his leave to follow up an idea, with the others reacting to his sudden departure. All that said, his colleagues and friends seem to regard him as merely a bit unusual. Even Julia tells him, "You're not the only one who lives inside your head." It must also be said that Murdoch's continual studies (and the deep concentration to pursue them) have provided him with highly useful expertise, though when asked about this in court, he merely replied, "I am <em>an</em> expert, yes."
</li><li> Detective Watts never maintains eye contact for long, is constantly fidgeting with things, has an unusual method of solving crimes, doesn't have many friends and got forced out of Station House One because he wasn't liked enough, is very smart and accomplished for his age (he was already a detective at age 26), and seems to have underdeveloped motor skills (he can't really hold a fork properly and his handwriting is very messy).

Later in the series, the characters find out that much of her trauma stems from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the destruction of her amygdalae and the revelation of the Miranda experiment</span>. This still leaves some questions open, though.

<ul><li> The various versions of Harrison Wells all exhibit poor social skills, trouble understanding or reading the emotions of others, a very task-oriented mindset, and a tendency to babble at length without realising that they're doing it, which are all traits that are often exhibited by people with autistic spectrum disorders.
</li><li> Eobard Thawne also has a lot of similar traits. He struggles to understand or relate to the emotions of others, has a very particular way of speaking and tends to repeat certain phrases, has very rigid internal rules and plans things far in advance, and fidgets a lot while stressed or thinking. The intensity of his obsession with the Flash is also very similar to the special interests that autistic people often have.

Strangely, he was also not diagnosed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">on Earth before ending up in Oz in 1992</span>. He has a hair-trigger temper, doesn't trust anyone, can't <em>stand</em> anyone being better than him (which fuels his hatred of magic), and has an inflated sense of his own importance. He has no trouble claiming credit for things he didn't do and tends to act (rather violently) on his suspicions, even if they're unfounded (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">like shooting his potential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> when he suspects she might be working against him, even though she was the only person on his side</span>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Travelers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Travelers">Travelers</a></em>: Original Marcy's disability is described as a "congenital underdevelopment of her brain" which, despite being a meaningful diagnosis, could refer to any of dozens of disorders. Even after this, the Traveler who takes over possibly has something as well, since she's very surprised at David's reaction upon finding her performing minor surgery on herself, acting like this is perfectly normal.

When JD is shown having a fantasy from another character's viewpoint, he abruptly stops talking, stares off vacantly into space for up to a minute and then spouts off a non-sequitur unrelated to the preceding conversation, which is bizarre behaviour by any measure. He is also shown to have no conscious control over his fantasies, sometimes seeing imagery that legitimately frightens or disturbs him while being apparently powerless to stop thinking about it, and on one occasion, when a sexual fantasy is interrupted, he complains that he "missed it" as if he couldn't simply imagine it at any time. Also, while most follow from JD's train of thought, some are involuntary and are triggered by something he sees, hears or experiences, to the point that his friends have learned to set them off on cue. At least one episode has taken place almost entirely inside JD's head without him realising until the last second, meaning he can potentially hallucinate a full day of his life. It's all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, but neurotypical people do not experience random, frequent and vivid waking visions.

</li><li> Farah Black. It's not entirely clear what psychological issues she's dealing with, but there are some there. She tends to immediately put all the blame on herself regardless of circumstances and is pretty paranoid, although considering the fact a body-swapping cult is involved, the paranoia is appropriate. Some of her mannerisms and insecurities also suggest she may have an autistic spectrum disorder or some kind of social anxiety disorder.

She's prone to wild mood swings and deep depression, is obsessive about the people she fixates on and often totally ignores anyone else, and has a tendency towards very extreme impulsive actions - the plot of the series itself kicks off when she totally abandons her successful career in New York to move across the country just because she encountered her ex-boyfriend and found he was living there. Her erratic behaviour is commented on by a number of characters throughout the show, and she's explicitly linked to depression, but in season three this trope is done away with as she is formally diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder.
<ul><li> Also deconstructed in the first episode of Season 4, where Josh is certain that he must have one condition or another that explains his obliviousness and immaturity. It turns out that no, he really is just oblivious and immature - not every character flaw is an undiagnosed disorder.

He lapses into believing he is still in the military, salutes an imaginary officer, and follows imaginary orders. After Emel's death, he sometimes hallucinates she is alive and even has conversations with her. He is prone to manic episodes and physical outbursts. He is described by another character at being unable to stand the pressure of responsibility and crumbles under the stress, though he excels at tasks he pursues at his own volition. He is acknowledged as mentally ill, but the narrative never assigns him a specific diagnosis.

<ul><li> One of the biggest examples is Lorna, who likely has some sort of delusional disorder. Most of her outright criminal behavior (Ebay scams aside) stem from a warped worldview and an inability to discern motives.

In the first episode, he shows up at Rand Enterprises ragged and barefoot and claiming to be someone thought dead for years, and yet he somehow didn't expect everyone to react like he was some crazy hobo. At first, viewers are led to believe this was due to him having lived as an ascetic monk for so long. But then we get flashbacks to his childhood and it turns out he was <em>always</em> socially off, spending all of his time at his parents' office and apparently not having friends except the two children of his parents' business partner. And even when we see flashbacks to his life at K'un L'un, its inhabitants demonstrated a level of decorum that did not explain Danny's odd behavior and obliviousness to his appearance in the series premier, especially since his arch-enemy Davos is able to blend in with Western society when he wants to, despite being <em>from</em> K'un L'un. Still, Danny's only established mental disorder is aviophobia (understandable given his backstory). This trope is downplayed in the second season; it's implied that living life on his own terms and being with Colleen allowed him to become better adjusted, though the reality is that he was simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurprisinglyImprovedSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurprisinglyImprovedSequel">written with a more consistent personality</a>.

Overall, his inability to express emotional state in any way, let alone a noncondescending way triumph even Sento Kiryu (mentioned bellow) and led to him being described as "emotionally constipated". Ever so rarely his reactions range from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngerBornOfWorry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngerBornOfWorry">angry</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyRabbitIdealismIsForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyRabbitIdealismIsForKids">outbursts</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">frothing at mouth</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILetGwenStacyDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILetGwenStacyDie">rage</a>. The series never resolves the chicken or egg sort of question whether he actually has some underlying condition or if it's a coping mechanism that he adopted to deal with the crushing societal pressures and expectations put on him for most of his life first as a son of hospital director and later as a talented surgeon. Even when he learns to relax a little and enjoy being a person instead of medical equipment, he is still immensely awkward unless going through the motions of what he knows to be acceptable social etiquette and absolutely terrified of getting ever slightly close to anyone.

While not lacking in the social skills department per se, he is brutally honest in informal settings, predictable liar to anyone who knows him and prefers scientific solitude. Also, he loathes interpersonal drama and all the weird hijicks his family engages in. His adoration of science can be unhealthy because he skips food and sleep in favor of working on his inventions and devolves into a manic ball of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squee">Squee!</a> that forgoes things like inappropriateness, empathy and aversion to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a>s.

It's hard to pinpoint exactly what's wrong. Even if his dissonantly cheerful persona doesn't give people the creeps (and it mostly does), they usually avoid him because he is obssesed with overlords and wants to be one himself. Despite being a skilled manipulator and strategist, he has the social graces of a sledgehammer. His apparent innability to form any social ties causes him to latch on whoever is willing to tolerate him. Said people are two time travelers who arrived from the future to prevent him from becoming an overlord and a herald of his future self working against them.

Laura also has a lot of trouble making eye contact with her high school crush when he comes over to the apartment. Laura is also intensely fixated and knowledgable on her glass figurine collection and plays her father's old records, usually to keep herself calm.

He frequently uses extreme force when dealing with mundane tasks, (especially in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf">matters involving his family</a>) is anti-social, and appears to suffer from a Lack of Empathy. (If the player kills a couple NPCs, and then goes to Michael's therapist, he'll acknowledge the killings, saying that he "Doesn't even care." His tone of voice even indicates that he feels guilty, about NOT feeling any guilt.) His therapist diagnoses him differently depending on how you play.

This discomfort with regards to his upbringing in the Chantry is referenced again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSilentGrove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSilentGrove">The Silent Grove</a></em> when he notes that <em>screaming prisoners</em> remind him of being forced to listen to the chant during his studies with the Templars, and how claustrophobic it made him feel.

</li><li> Despite being a spirit that can read the hearts of people to immediately know their memories, feelings, and thoughts, Cole exhibits curious and slightly unsettling behaviors that allude to a damaged psyche. In <em>Asunder</em>, he exhibits signs of disassociation and amnesia. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Inquisition</a></em>, on one of the occasions when you approach him in Skyhold, he becomes extremely unnerved and overwhelmed when surrounded by many suffering people. If you speak with him after <em>Wicked Eyes, Wicked Hearts</em>, he expresses confusion as to the purpose for the facades that the Orlesian nobility put on for one another, and party banter from then on may further touch upon this sentiment; and difficulty in recognizing the subtleties underlying certain questions that other companions ask him. His default outfit includes a wide-brimmed floppy hat, which he uses to shield his gaze from others when speaking; it is rare for him to make eye contact with others. He also displays childish behaviors that seem out-of-place due to his form's supposed age being 20 years old, which could be chalked up to his being a spirit unused to the physical world, the original Cole having possessed a mind predisposed to such behaviors, or a mixture of both. Examples of this include speaking with a child-like wonder about the hats worn at the ball in Halamshiral and, in the initial cutscene where the player character decides if Cole should stay or leave Skyhold, being found sitting on the ground catching what may be insects. Above all, Cole is extremely adamant about his way of viewing others: Those who help are good and those who hurt (even if they had good intentions, like the Grey Wardens) are bad. After his personal quest, in which he resolves his biggest trauma and fully embraces either his human side or spirit nature, he settles down considerably.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> games, due to having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a>, tend to have a number of characters exhibit odd mannerisms and quirks:

</li><li> Bernadetta is an incredibly shy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NervousWreck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NervousWreck">Nervous Wreck</a> with poor social skills, only indulging in special interests when people aren't looking.
</li><li> Felix has difficulty expressing emotions, a near-single minded focus on swordfighting, and a self-admitted dislike of making eye contact when talking.
</li><li> Ferdinand is energetic, has a short attention span, and has a tendency to go over the top to get people to like him. He also has a borderline obsession with outdoing Edelgard.
</li><li> Annette is scatterbrained and clumsy but also obsessed with learning magic, and an early sidequest with the Blue Lions involves giving her some herbs to help her be calmer and more careful.
</li><li> Marianne has low self-esteem, is generally antisocial, and lacks focus. If not recruited before the timeskip, she never shows up again, with no reason being given.

Yet, he's very resourceful and is perfectly willing to do sociopathic things to achieve his ends. He has no problem talking to complete strangers, but is hopeless around Elaine, to the point where even after he's marries her, he does whatever she says and she handles his business whilst he furthers his interests in being a pirate. Guybrush manages to alienate almost any friend he makes.
</li><li> Otis, the prisoner, is just a little strange - he says he was jailed for stealing a flower, fails to notice the fact that a cake is hiding a file despite it weighing more, says he would do anything for his freedom before proceeding to do absolutely nothing when Guybrush invites him onto his ship.
</li><li> Stan is extremely self-serving - his response to his businesses getting a bad reputation is to simply change the nature of his business, and his attempts to be friends with Guybrush are always a flimsy excuse to sell something.
</li><li> Wally is good at cartography and hopeless in every other situation. He's admittedly based on nerd stereotypes.
</li><li> In "Curse Of Monkey Island", the Shakespearean actor Slappy Cromwell seems to have no issue playing to an audience entirely of monkeys.

While other Ta-Matoran do their work, he's out practicing the art of "walking quick by moving slow" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GassHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GassHole">and farting</a>) in a creepy, dead forest. He doesn't stop practicing even when conversing with the player, and casually asks if you're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">the Makuta</a> or not. He's slow (except when performing his technique), deliberate and unnervingly calm among all the hot-headed, fiery Ta-Matoran. Kopeke from the same game also shows signs of this trope, being coldly antisocial, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne">quiet</a> and emotionless in his rare moments of talking, doing his work with robotic precision.

He insisted on his palace always being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeatFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeatFreak">kept clean</a> and (perhaps apocryphally) was said to defecate on the floors to keep his servants busy.

He'd frequently strip naked in public and, toward the end of his life, would attack and bite visitors. His madness is theorized to have even been something supernatural left behind in Castle Solitude by his mad aunt, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">Wolf Queen Potema</a>, but it remains a mystery. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod">Sheogorath</a>'s quest in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Dragonborn</a> posthumously cure Pelagius of whatever madness ailed him by ridding him of his night terrors, combating his fear of his mother and strengthening his self-confidence.

The reason why she becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> to begin with is because being around her beloved Senpai was the first time she ever felt happiness.

In the third game, he has a conversation with Alette in which he is uncharacteristically lucid and straightforward for a moment before reverting to his usual self. During this conversation, he confides in Alette that he knows there's something wrong with him and that he attempts to treat his condition by focusing on objects of personal importance.

He can be found waking up in a cold sweat thinking the Injuns are coming to get him. He worries he will end up with the same dementia that his dad had that caused him to lose his mind. He is implied to be gay living in the not accepting of being gay 1890s, meaning hes likely dealing with a lot of shame and self-loathing. Its not clear what exactly is wrong with him but its no wonder hes so troubled.

In addition, he's highly talkative and vocal when "in the zone" despite not being especially interested in interacting with others unless he wants something from them; his way of speaking, body language, and facial expressions are all (somewhat clumsily) performative even if no one's necessarily paying attention; he's got a rarely-blinking, near-constant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThousandYardStare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThousandYardStare">Thousand-Yard Stare</a> that wanders frequently and seldom focuses on eye contact; and he's very intelligent in the sciences, but has something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplexityAddiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplexityAddiction">Complexity Addiction</a>, going out of his way to turn anything he can into a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame">game</a>" or "toy".

She does not have this problem with flowers, of which she is obsessed with; she speaks with them freely, takes long, detailed journals about their growth and daily activities, and even personifies them, giving them names, personalities, and as evidenced by one in-game event, the ability to be jealous.

Season 2 and beyond have also shown that he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> tendencies bordering on the fetishistic, and Season 11 has him even displaying some tendencies normally associated with <em>senility</em> while stuck in Crash Site Bravo.

Several episodes have heavily implied that he might be somewhere on the autistic spectrum, and it's been also all but stated that he suffers from at least one learning disorder. That being said, the ambiguity is kept intentionally vague for Caboose since he's also the only character in the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWallObserver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWallObserver">to be cognizant of the fact that he's fictional</a>, which makes it hard to tell how much of his craziness is him being an idiot and how much is him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroughTheEyesOfMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroughTheEyesOfMadness">trying to put what he's seeing into the proper frame of reference for everyone</a>.

He also lacks coordination and has to wear a helmet to avoid injuring himself.
</li><li> Jake was raised in almost complete isolation on a deserted island by his grandmother and shows poor social skills that make him nearly oblivious to the feelings of others to the point it comes off as this, especially his tendency to ramble on about his issues without regard for the feelings of the person he's talking to, which actually causes Jane to destroy her computer out of frustration after he <em>yet again</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">fails to realize she has feelings for him</a> and causes his boyfriend to break up with him.

</li><li> Clubs Deuce/Courtyard Droll is very childish (despite being a grown man who's part of a gang), gets easily excited at the smallest victory, and has difficulty paying attention to people or focusing on a given task. He also seems convinced that his fellow gangsters are just his eccentric and lovable family.
</li><li> Caliborn/<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lord English</span> is undeniably a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">sociopath</a>, but also admits finding it very hard to think clearly, often overlooks obvious solutions to his problems in favor of unnecessarily complex workarounds, has very poor social skills, lacks impulse control and self-awareness, and admits to "thinking in colours", suggesting he views the world in a fundamentally different way. At one point he does mention that he has a learning disorder.

He sits on his haunches, sleeps in strange places and for extremely long periods of time, scratches doors rather than knocking when he wants someone to open them and has engaged his teammates in social grooming. However, in spite of all his strangeness, Lalli is a pretty well-adjusted human being (apart from having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">No Social Skills</a> and being somewhat of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolander</a>) and has found a way to turn his quirks into a useful career as a night scout.

Her roommate Amber has tried to help her read social cues with mixed results.

This often involves physically attacking the people around her, though sometimes it is just shown in her sudden personality change, and her inability to be reasoned with. It's never played for laughs. Also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Professor Baek hinted that Jung had some kind of disorder, but never specified what that was.

</li><li> Ethan from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/CtrlAltDel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/CtrlAltDel">Ctrl+Alt+Del</a></em> just doesn't seem to be capable of functioning as a normal human being. He's so obsessed with gaming that he suffers actual withdrawal symptoms if deprived of any means of gaming for more than an hour or so, his behaviour to his friends is often deeply insensitive, and his behaviour towards people he doesn't like can be downright sociopathic, to the point where he inflicts potentially murderous levels of violence against his co-worker Rob for the heinous crime of liking <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CounterStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CounterStrike">Counter-Strike</a></em> and saying "bro" rather a lot.

At first, she just comes across as taciturn and undemonstrative, then when the bar burns down she continues to be taciturn and undemonstrative, eventually explaining when Clinton congratulates her for being calm "I'm not ... great. With emotions", and the stress is actually making it hard for her to talk at all. Later, her friend Renee says she's "not great at working out people's intentions", and she says needs a new routine now that the bar is gone. She also says she has trouble interpreting facial expressions at one point.
</li><li> At the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheStupiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheStupiders">The Stupiders</a></em>, we are told that everyone has at least one problem or quirk, but what exactly those problems are is left up to the reader to discern.

</li><li> According to her description (from 2012), Madgie has issues but it's not said what they so happen to be, besides her being "psychologically backwards", leaning toward destructive impulses, and having alternate personalities. Bunny thinks she should be institutionalized.

<ul><li> Razelle has some sort of psychosis if her backstory is to go by. Unfortunately, in her fits of delirium, she is prone to committing violent acts if left unrestrained, although that could be part of some underlying impulse problem, worsened by said psychosis. Despite either of the two, be she coherent or not, she can be described as pleasant.
</li><li> Coriander, according to her deviantArt description, is a rather eccentric sort with bizarre obsessions of counting to nonsensical numbers, plants, beaches, and nature in general, along with suffering a short attention span and is generally unaware of where she is, even in familiar territory, in which case, she may remember or she may forget.
</li><li> Gas is described as being "not right in the head". However, considering what she does normally, which is playing with chemicals and making gases from them, this can be seen as a result of brain-damaging side-effects.
</li><li> Frankie, as per her profile, is described as being "ambiguous and erratic", along with the fact that she is friendly, yet tends to disregard others, and that she seems to lack some understanding of her actions.
</li><li> "Nuclear Blast" Nova's page describes her as "not being right in the head" and states that she doesn't have a comprehension of her actions and is "painfully reckless" with a small burst of rationality. It's not said if she was born that way or her mental state was caused by a brain tumor.

<ul><li> Jake has a very short attention span and often blurts things out without thinking as well as a tendency to do things without thinking about consequences or the impact on others, both physical and emotional. (Though he can probably be excused by the fact that, anthropomorphic or not, he's still a dog)
</li><li> Marceline is overly flirtatious with others, displays mild sociopathic tendencies, and seems to have trouble understanding other people's emotions. At the same time though, she is also a vampiric cambion (heck, her dad is the ruler of Ooo's version of Hell, the Nightosphere) and it's later revealed that beneath her cheerful and easygoing exterior, she has suffered a lot of personal losses and fears getting too close to people as a result, despite desperately wanting to.
</li><li> Lemongrab, in particular, could keep a team of psychologists busy for weeks, with his wildly exaggerated emotions, total incomprehension of other peoples' emotions and thought-processes, extreme arrogance, constant suspicion of others, and ability to switch from pathetic to frighteningly vicious on a dime. Interestingly, his clone Lemongrab II still has issues but is much gentler and more moral.
</li><li> "Bonnie and Neddy" introduces Princess Bubblegum's brother, Neddy. He's an enormous candy dragon who's also extremely neurotic and afraid of seemingly everything except his sister. Specifically, Neddy's dislike of touch, discomfort around new or harsh stimuli, drawing comfort from repetitive actions (sucking the tree root) and special rhythmic sounds made by PB, and difficulty with people are all evocative of Autism Spectrum Disorder. PB is well aware of how different Neddy is from most people.

Roger even lampshades this with his response to Steve's plan to exact revenge on a bully by dressing up as a girl and seducing him: "Yes, let's keep that plan between you, me, and the string of therapists who won't be able to help you."

Though the real Barry still shines through sometimes ("Let's kill his parents next! Let's kill them all!").
</li><li> Roger often displays signs of mental disability himself. One episode reveals there's an imaginary little boy in the attic who he talks to, he developed a Split Personality in "The One That Got Away" and in "Oedipal Panties" he freely admits to Francine, "I don't know what's real."

Also, he is very insistent about a box that Teacher Harriet wants everyone to play pretend with being just a box, at least at first, and mostly just ignores the whole situation in favor of his reading, at least until he finally decides to play race car.

Pinkie has shown that she is aware of how annoying she can be, but is either unwilling or incapable of altering her behavior. She is also implied to create the machines that she uses and has displayed incredible memory and eye for detail.
</li><li> It seems to run in the family because Pinkie's sister, Maud Pie also displays eccentric behavior of her own. She shares her sister's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded">literal-mindedness</a>, but unlike Pinkie, she displays practically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl">no emotion</a> whatsoever. She also talks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyMonotone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyMonotone">in monotone</a> and has a narrow-minded obsession with rocks. This general behavior makes her so un-relatable to Pinkie's friends that they don't really know what to make of her and don't seem to "click" socially speaking. Maud is cognizant of this, though.
</li><li> The official portrayal of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBystander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBystander">Derpy Hooves</a> shows her as ignorant to the scale of dangers and also simple in how she treats things, giving the impression that she's a bit... off.

She's seen using breathing exercises to keep herself in check by the later episodes of season three and has learned to interact with other ponies less clinically, but it's clear that even in-universe this is a real problem for her that she's working on getting better at dealing with.
</li><li> Fluttershy is almost never seen with other ponies besides the other members of the Mane Six, preferring the company of her many animal friends. She has severe anxiety if she has to socialize beyond basic business transactions and small talk, with full-blown panic attacks (complete with hyperventilation and hallucinations) if ponies laugh at her.

She also shows extreme paranoia and distrust of those different from herself, to the point of not even <em>trying</em> to get to know the rest of her town until she'd convinced them to give up their Cutie Mark or outright stolen it (as Sugar Belle's plead with her attests to). And when something enrages her, she goes from calm and composed to explosions of anger and psychotic rage <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to the point of nearly attacking, and then <em>actually</em> attacking others who were supposedly friends</span>.
