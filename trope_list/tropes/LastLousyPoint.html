</p><p>While most, if not all, of the other points that count toward completion are relatively straightforward or easy to get, there always seems to be one (or more) that just, well, <em>isn't.</em> This could be because the puzzle is just far harder than the other puzzles in the game (and possibly harder than the developers intended).

Certain parts of the map you would never need to explore are thrown in just to make 200% a daunting task. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">Some need glitches to access</a>, making the true total <a class="urllink" href="http://worldbeyondwalls.free.fr/portal.php">425.5% and rising.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

<ul><li> For getting 100% of all monster souls, there's Sky Fish. This monster only appears in two obscure and optional rooms, and appears so briefly that you'll have to stop time to kill it. To get the ability to stop time, you have to obtain the Chronomage's soul, which in turn requires you to obtain Galamoth's soul, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">which requires you to defeat Legion.</a>
</li><li> The Tsuchinoko. Unlike the Sky Fish, you <em>can</em> kill it without stopping time, but it's really difficult because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">it has a buttload of HP</a> and it tends to disappear the instant it sees you. Equipping the Nemesis soul helps with the latter, but it's not a sure thing.
</li><li> For getting 100% of the map explored, there's a secret area. To get into this secret area, which is behind <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a waterfall</span>, you have to equip the soul that lets you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> walk on water</span> while equipping one of the few souls in the game that lets you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">transform into a monster that charges forward through almost anything, including waterfalls</span>.
</li><li> For getting 100% of all items, there are a few items that can only be found on hard mode and a few items that you get for beating boss rush mode ridiculously fast.
</li></ul></li><li> The legendary Pokémon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRumble">Pokémon Rumble Blast</a></em> are the bane of anyone seeking to collect every Pokémon. For starters, you only have a 5% chance of running into one instead of the usual boss at the end of a level. On top of this, most of the levels have multiple potential legendary Pokémon who can appear, meaning that even if one does decide to show up, it won't necessarily be the one you need. This is made even worse by the fact that the game counts each form of a Pokémon as an individual entry in the collection, as Arceus has a whopping 17 different forms it needs to be obtained in.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames">The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages and Seasons</a></em> have Seed Rings, of which there are 64 and several of them are of questionable or no use. Four to six rings out of the lot stand out as especially irritating to get ahold of.
<ul><li> The first pair are two of the five Trophy Rings, which just say that you've done something and otherwise have no effect. In particular, the Rupee Ring and 100th Ring, requiring you to obtain 10,000 Rupees overall (not at once) and appraise 100 Rings (including duplicates), respectively. These are simply grindfests, plain and simple, with even the best ways of acquiring Rupees and random rings leaning on slow for the amount of each required.
</li><li> The second pair is from <em>Ages</em> specifically; the Light Ring L-2 (which allows you to shoot sword beams even if you're missing up to three hearts) and the infamous Bomber's Ring (which lets you have two bombs on screen at once). The Light Ring L-2 requires you to complete a shooting gallery minigame with a score of 350 or higher. Sounds easy, but it's complicated by the fact that the odds of actually getting the ring are <strong>abysmal</strong>, and you're much more likely to get one of a number of easily acquired trash rings instead, with it usually taking over ten attempts to get the Light Ring L-2. The only bright side is that all the trash rings you'll end up with will help with the aforementioned 100th Ring. The Bomber's Ring, on the other hand, has a much higher rate of actually appearing, with the complication being that it can only be obtained from the hardest level of the Goron Dancing minigame, which is strict to the point of frustration. To top that off, it's once again <strong>not</strong> a 100% chance to get it, and you might end up with the Protection Ring instead, which not only is of debatable utility (all damage taken is one heart, whether it was originally higher or lower), but can easily be picked up by other means.
</li><li> The final pair is a more meta example, those being the GBA Time and Nature Rings. On the original cartridges these Rings are trivial to obtain, being sold for 100 Rupees as long as the game is in a Game Boy Advance. The problem arises in the 3DS Virtual Console versions, where the games are emulated as if being played on a Game Boy Color, leaving the Advance Shops where you'd buy these rings permanently locked away. The rings are still possible to get by messing with passwords, but given that neither of them do anything in the first place, whether or not it's really worth the effort is up to interpretation.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a></em> has a minigame where Link is sparring with his teacher, Orca. The goal of the game is to hit Orca as many times as you can before he hits you three times. The last tangible reward is given at 500 hits, but if you manage to get all the way up to 999 hits, you get a brief cutscene where he tells Link he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpassedTheTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpassedTheTeacher">surpassed him</a> and starts calling you Master (he also asks Link <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">if his index finger is tired</a>). Orca's AI becomes increasingly more aggressive and counter-happy the more hits he takes, so good luck.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkBetweenWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkBetweenWorlds">The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds</a></em> has the Cucco Ranch minigame, where the player must dodge swarms of angry Cuccos who are attacking Link in a small, enclosed space. You lose instantly if any of the Cuccos touch you. To get the Piece of Heart you need to last for 30 seconds on the hardest difficulty, which is a decent challenge but nothing too ridiculous. However, completing this also unlocks Endless Mode, and some sadistic developer decided to put <em>another</em> reward for lasting 999 seconds (~17 minutes) on Endless. It's mostly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">Bragging Rights Reward</a>, not needed to max out Link's stats (all you get is a giant Cucco that sits on the world map and gives you hearts when you talk to it), however, it all but ensures only the most insanely dedicated players will be able to truly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% the game</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em>: The Korok Seeds. There are 900 of them. You only have to find a little less than half of them to get all the upgrades, but all 900 count towards your file's completion rating, so if you want that to say 100% you have to collect them all. Bizarrely, the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience">seems to taunt you</a> for actually doing this, as your reward for finding every single one is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a literal pile of golden shit that does absolutely nothing. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ljw2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ljw2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ljw2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">On the bright side, if you know a bit of Japanese puns and gift choices, it's at least a pretty straightforward good luck (or <em>unko</em>) charm.</span></span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts">Psychonauts</a></em>:
<ul><li> The only way to unlock some of the cutscenes is to wander around the campgrounds; when you get to certain locations, the scene will be triggered. But there's nothing that tells you this, and in fact, you're encouraged to use the camp's Fast Travel system to get around quickly instead of going on foot. And to make matters worse, once night falls, you lose the chance to see them ever again. Thankfully, this doesn't count toward 100% completion in the game—but it DOES show up on your menu screen, leaving players to wonder how on earth they're supposed to fill in the missing movies.
</li><li> The figments of imagination. The levels are filled to the brim with collectibles, and while finding them all can be challenging sometimes, they at least have the mercy of being easy to see and not terribly numerous. This is not the case with the figments: there are literally <em>hundreds</em> of them in each level, so even though they're handed out like candy at first, you can literally rack up hours of searching once you're down to the last dozen or so. What's worse is that they're semi-transparent, usually not very big, and can sometimes be in hard-to-reach places or even <em>move around</em> the level. The worst part, though, is that they're all very brightly colored. That may be all well and good in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberatelyMonochrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberatelyMonochrome">Deliberately Monochrome</a> levels like Sasha's Shooting Gallery, but it's an absolute <em>nightmare</em> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazingTechnicolorWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazingTechnicolorWorld">Amazing Technicolor Worlds</a> like Milla's Dance Party and Black Velvetopia, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">where using a guide is borderline necessary.</a>
</li><li> Rank 101. Not only do you have to get every collectible and figment, you also need to go back into Basic Braining and redo the combat training repeatedly, with it getting more difficult each time.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostPig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostPig">Lost Pig</a></em>, which deliberately riffs on the years of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonCrawling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonCrawling">Dungeon Crawling</a> IF games with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KleptomaniacHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KleptomaniacHero">Kleptomaniac Heroes</a> that followed <em>Colossal Cave</em>, has a single-point achievement that can be easily missed if you play it like a standard IF game, but is easy to achieve if you try (and there are several hints toward what's required if you pay attention). The final point required for 100% Completion is achieved by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">demonstrating to the dungeon's custodian that you're not a kleptomaniac hero, by not taking anything out of the dungeon when you leave at the end that doesn't belong to you</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sierra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sierra">Sierra</a> adventure games are somewhat infamous for this:
<ul><li> For instance, looking at a six-pixel tall jogger who appears intermittently in the background (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeisureSuitLarry2LookingForLoveInSeveralWrongPlaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeisureSuitLarry2LookingForLoveInSeveralWrongPlaces">Leisure Suit Larry 2: Looking for Love (in Several Wrong Places)</a></em>); searching every bit of evidence, sometimes twice (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PoliceQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PoliceQuest">Police Quest</a></em>), defeating every single type of random encounter at least once (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGlory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGlory">Quest for Glory</a></em>) and performing every required action at the earliest opportunity (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuestVTheNextMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuestVTheNextMutation">Space Quest V: The Next Mutation</a></em>).
</li><li> One almost-cruel example is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuestIVRogerWilcoAndTheTimeRippers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuestIVRogerWilcoAndTheTimeRippers">Space Quest IV</a></em>, where you have to pick up an unstable ordnance, and then <em>immediately put it back</em>, in order to get maximum points, in a genre where you are encouraged to pick up anything and everything you can find.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldRush">Gold Rush!</a></em> pulls no punches, making it possible to win the game and easily miss <em>100 points</em> in a 250 point maximum, while providing multiple solutions to puzzles and only giving max points for one specific solution.
</li><li> Even the two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EcoQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EcoQuest">EcoQuest</a></em> games, designed for a younger audience, have pixel-hunting puzzles that require you to keep your eyes open in EVERY scene if you want <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>. The second game is much worse with this, as you sometimes only get one chance to record an item into your in-game encyclopedia, and they can be pretty obscure within a scene. And yeah, each item is worth one point.

Here are the requirements in a nutshell: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jayden, Madison, Lauren and Hassan have to die; Ethan has to get arrested permanently, Madison and Ethan need to fornicate (with Ethan forgiving Madison), and The Origami Killer needs to walk off free.</span> Oh, and you can't skip any chapters while doing this.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn">Point of No Return</a> doesn't help either. Might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a>, as getting all the points unlocks <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an additional, spoiler-heavy end cutscene</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAmazonTrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAmazonTrail">The Amazon Trail</a></em> has a few last lousy animals when it comes to photographing all the animal and plant species.
<ul><li> That darn Amazonian Manatee. It only pops its head out for a few seconds and that's it. You miss it, and it's gone for good. Time to head back to the boat, and try again. It's even hard to tell whether or not it spawned at all since the manatee doesn't appear immediately.
</li><li> The Boto, or river dolphin, is another annoying creature that spawns rarely, but it's not as bad as the manatee. Unlike the manatee, the Boto initially sits under the water with its back protruding from the edge of the screen. Eventually it jumps, and sometimes it disappears for good after it jumps. The good news is that it takes a while for the Boto to jump, so you have ample time to photograph it (if you don't mind a poor quality picture).
</li><li> The pirarucu in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishingMinigame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishingMinigame">Fishing Minigame</a>.

Each gem in turn requires 4 CTR tokens and then a win in a four race tournament. The tokens and gems do count toward completion percentage, though. There's also the Oxide time trials. You don't even get Oxide for beating all of them, just a shortcut to the scrapbook.

</li><li> The Last Lousy Decal in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplitSecond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplitSecond">Split Second</a></em> requires you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus">have a save file</a> from Blackrock's previous racing game <em>Pure</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">This is the only decal that doesn't have an associated Achievement.</a>

The last road tends to be some tiny off-ramp interstate or a dead end road buried in some parking lot in the middle of nowhere. Players have to go over all of the map at maximum zoom to find the unexplored road.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Forza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Forza">Forza</a> Horizon</em> and its sequels are another Last Lousy Road examples since each game has an achievement tied to driving on every single road on the map. The third and fourth games are arguably the worst. Some of the roads are quite off the beaten path, and some dead ends and even driveways count as roads. Not only that, but such roads are depicted as a dotted line on the map making it even more confusing. Good luck trying to find that last single grayed out dash. The fourth game also has a Last Lousy Barn Find that only appears once you purchase Bamburgh Castle for 10 million credits.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeetleAdventureRacing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeetleAdventureRacing">Beetle Adventure Racing</a></em> has nine multiplayer courses - three available right away and six that can only be played by acquiring all 100 bonus points from each track. What the last one takes will make you want to tear your hair out. It requires finding all 100 bonus points in Wicked Woods, the last and hardest track in the game. This is <em>much</em> more difficult than it sounds, since many of the points require pixel-perfect aim and all the ramps have slight lumps that will send you tumbling in completely the wrong direction since they're so cunningly placed. What's worse, the track is so crazy, you cannot afford to turn around and get anything you've missed - it's all or nothing if you want to get them all AND finish with a rank that will allow the points you've collected to count. If you miss a point crate on first pass, you might as well start over. If you've <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">unlocked the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">police car</a></span>, you're only halfway to being able to do it.
</li><li> In <em>Riptide GP Renegade</em>, the Easter Egg for the Tropico circuit is far more difficult to collect than the others, requiring the player to launch their (preferably fully upgraded) jet ski off the halfpipe at just the right speed and angle.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BurnoutParadise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BurnoutParadise">Burnout Paradise</a></em> requires you to find all the Smash Gates, Billboards and Super Jumps in order to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>. Most of them are easy to spot (even if sometimes not that easy to <em>reach</em>), but some are tucked away in hidden places, such as a particular hard-to-see rooftop in Downtown Paradise. Thankfully, the stats screen breaks down the yet-undiscovered secrets by district, so you don't have to search the <em>whole</em> map (though the individual districts aren't exactly small by themselves.) DJ Atomika lampshades this during the game:

<ul><li> The Diskun Trophy in <em>Melee</em> is not worth the effort, and wouldn't be, even if the game paid you by the hour to complete it. Ignore that trophy, you'll thank TV Tropes. It requires you to get every single point bonus in the game. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/gamecube/file/516492/15051">Click here for the list of point bonuses.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> It's worse than it looks, since many will never occur in a normal match and are difficult to get even when it's all you're trying to do. It's obscene.
</li><li> Young Link's Target Challenge is notably more difficult than the other ones; most of the targets are spread out very far and behind obstacles. But that's not the worst part: there's a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> at the beginning when you have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallJump">Wall Jump</a> out of a pit. Nothing in the game even mentions wall jumping, it's a rather difficult maneuver to pull off, <em>and</em> this is the only challenge of any kind in <em>Melee</em> where wall jumping is even useful, let alone required.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel">Subspace Bomb Factory (lower)</a> in the adventure mode of <em>Brawl</em>. There are two specific treasures which are difficult to get. One requires using a character who can wall jump in an inconspicuous hallway next to a switch which clearly shows that you're supposed to turn around. The other involves going through a moving door in a dangerous scrolling section, bouncing on a trampoline off the top of the screen (which would normally kill you), using your double jump to get even higher, then attacking to break open the box. Both boxes randomly generate a trophy, which you probably already have, so they don't really do anything other than letting you have a 100% completion score.
</li><li> There's also the trophies that you have to beat every mode in the game (except Subspace Emissary) on the highest difficulty setting to get (which you can't just use a Golden Hammer to forcibly gain), as well as the Meta Ridley trophy, which requires you to get close to beating Meta Ridley in Subspace Emissary, then wait for a trophy stand to spawn (keep in mind the fight is on a timer,) then throw the trophy stand at him, and then jump off the Falcon Flyer that you've been riding the whole fight that's your only platform and <em>grab the Meta Ridley trophy out of the air</em> before it disappears off the bottom of the screen. Not to mention the Stickers trophy, which you only get after obtaining at least one of every sticker in the game, of which there are over six hundred and are all allocated by RNG.
</li><li> One of the challenges in <em>Smash 4</em> is to get 300,000G. It's quite easy to get G by playing Classic, All-Star, or Smash Tour modes, as well as completing certain Event Matches and getting some of the other challenges... but by the time you find out about the challenge, you've probably spent most of the money you can earn on trophies, and to get the achievement, it's not enough to simply have earned 300,000G over the course of the game, you need to have that much available to spend at once.
</li></ul></li><li> The Story Modes of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueCalamityTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueCalamityTrigger">first</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueContinuumShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueContinuumShift">two</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BlazBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BlazBlue">BlazBlue</a></em> games tracks what percentage of the cutscenes in each character's story you have seen. However, the story mode for <em>Calamity Trigger</em> includes the cutscenes that play when you lose a match in that percentage, even when all it leads to is a Game Over screen. Since each character's Story mode contains multiple branching paths, each with their own fights, you basically play it all for the story and then do the <em>entire</em> thing again to get the defeat cutscenes. There is, at least, a text skip option - whether that does enough to make it worthwhile is down to the sheer patience of the player. Thankfully, <em>Continuum Shift</em> removed those cutscenes from the percentage.

And of course it will take you at least 25 seconds to get there, assuming that you start the instant the level starts, know <em>exactly</em> where the secret is, and <em>run</em> all the way. There are also a few other levels throughout the game where 100% can't "officially" be obtained, but those are mostly due to bugs/misplaced monsters and zones.

</li><li> A thankfully tiny number of <em>Doom</em> custom levels, such as <em>Eternal Doom</em> Level 5 and <em>2002: A Doom Odyssey</em> Episode 1 Level 9, contain secrets that can only be obtained after five minutes of playing time have elapsed. As soon as the clock hits five, a door opens for about 10 seconds, and then closes. If you didn't get the secret before the door closed, you're out of luck! Start over from your last save (if you made any!). At least <em>Eternal Doom</em> actually hints at this near the secret in question.

The Ice Shriekbat from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">the first game</a> is an infamous example. Like all Shriekbats, these are difficult to spot and dive bomb Samus and explode as soon as soon as Samus gets near them. Unlike all other Shriekbats, they never respawn (except in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegionalBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegionalBonus">PAL version</a>, supposedly). They also only appear in one room and are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">gone so quickly that you probably won't even know they were a unique creature.</a> As some sort of cruel joke, their Logbook description suggests using the Thermal Visor to spot them, an item which you don't even have at that point in the game. In the rereleased version in the <em>Metroid Prime Trilogy</em> compilation on the Wii, the Ice Shriekbats respawn. Both a nice surprise to people who missed them the first time around and a nasty shock to the people who never expected to see them again.

Thus, if you want to scan it, you'll likely have to let them attack the vessel where you are.

You could unlock special pictures with certain goals. Some would be like taking hundreds of pictures, trading tens of pictures to males AND females, or any other of random tasks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonSNES" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonSNES">Harvest Moon SNES</a></em> not only has several hidden mechanics for calculating your final Ranch Master Rate, but some of them contain bugs. To reach the maximum of 999, each girl's affection level must be between 496 and 511; if you instead raise their affection to 999, you'll miss out on one point for each girl, ending up with a maximum Ranch Master Rate of 994. To make matters worse, you can't simply raise your wife's affection to 511 and then leave it there, because maximising your score requires you to have two children, which can only happen if her affection reaches at least 650. To get the last Ranch Master point, you have to actively <em>lower</em> her affection after having your second child, typically by giving her gifts she dislikes such as weeds.
<ul><li> Getting the maximum score for your crops is also challenging, although not quite as counter-intuitive; you can get the maximum score by shipping <em>either</em> 496-511 of a crop, or 1008-1023. Ship 512 instead of 511, though, and you get a zero for that crop.

Seeing how the game in itself is a RNG, achieving Real Platinum God (or 1001%) is gonna take some time and luck:
<ul><li> The alternate form of Gemini, Steven, gained a ridiculously rare unique drop: the item Steven was removed from every drop pool except for Steven's, and Steven is far more likely to drop Little Steven. The <em>Afterbirth</em> DLC made Steven a lot more common by adding it to the Gold Chest item pool.
</li><li> Both Meat Boy and Bandage Girl require fighting all four of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse bosses in one run. And while having the Book of Revelations helps guarantee you a fight with a horsemen, the fact that Death can be replaced with Conquest (who only drops the White Pony item) makes this even more luck-based. Again, <em>Afterbirth</em> makes this a <em>lot</em> easier using a trick involving the Box of Friends.
</li><li> Any of the Secret Room exclusive items (1up, Black Lotus, Skeleton Key, Missingno, and Raw Liver), simply because Secret Rooms so seldom spawn items in <em>Rebirth</em>. The best you can do in Afterbirth requires a time-consuming method that involves infinite money, item restocking, and item pool randomization.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DonkeyKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DonkeyKong">Donkey Kong</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry1">Donkey Kong Country</a></em>, the 101st percent can be obtained by reaching a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusStage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusStage">Bonus Stage</a> hidden inside <em>another</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusStage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusStage">Bonus Stage</a>. The first bonus stage is a matching game where you time your jumps to match three objects. You can only get to the second bonus stage by winning the worst item (a single banana), which causes a barrel to drop. You then have to grab that barrel and crash through the wall before the "celebration fanfare" is over. And you can only use Diddy, because he holds the barrel in front of his body (whereas DK holds it over his head, and you don't have enough time to throw it and then enter the resulting opening).
</li><li> <em>Donkey Kong Land</em> has several, but the worst is probably in the "Spiky Tire Trail" level, in which to get to a bonus stage you have to jump down what looks like a bottomless pit, with no real indication that it's anything <em>but</em> a bottomless pit.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64">Donkey Kong 64</a></em>:

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HubLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HubLevel">Hub Level</a> itself has five golden bananas for each character, as well as an extra one earned after you've caught all Banana Fairies in the gane.

</li><li> There's also one final Battle Arena Crown that you can find, located in Hideout Helm. To get to it, you need to use Diddy Kong's barrel jetpack to fly to the top of the Blast-O-Matic machine that's (on your first visit) counting down to blow up DK Island. People who don't know about it will probably not think to look up there because the key to the last boss battle is available, Hideout Helm lacks many other collectibles contained in other stages (like Bananas and Coins) which can lead to people not thinking it has a battle arena (unless they dig into the pause menu), and it's entirely possible to get said final key without it (getting the key requires 4 Crowns, and there are 10 total in the game).

Fortunately, neither of these levels are necessary for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>, but only for <em>10<strong>5</strong>% Completion</em>.

To get it, you need to complete a series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">Timed Missions</a>, one right after the other, involving slowing down propeller blades, tiptoing above bottomless pits, and swimming through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimyWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimyWater">Grimy Water</a> all within a short timeframe to nab it.
</li><li> The other Last Lousy Jiggy is easily missed, since it's up the top of the giant tree in the level Click Clock Wood, at an altitude that is only reachable while the player is transformed into a bee and that you never normally have to go to. There's also the whole note issue. Click Clock Wood has four variations of the level, and you have to survive all 4 to get the hundred notes with the clincher being that you have to start from 0 if you die.

Once you've collected it for each level, there are still two more to collect. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The first you get for having an A rating or better for the combined time of all stages, and the second you get by choosing to interact at a certain moment in the ending cutscenes that can only be interacted with if you have all the other Gold Gems, including the one for the combined stage times.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2">Sonic Adventure 2</a></em>, you will automatically get an A Rank if you collect all of the rings in a level. They don't make this easy, though.
<ul><li> Metal Harbor has a single ring sitting completely by itself in a place you wouldn't check unless you knew it was there.
</li><li> Pumpkin Hill contains a pair of rings floating in an arbitrary, obscured part of the abyss around the level, away from everything else of importance. They're also below the point in the pit that registers as a death, so the player has to use a magnetic shield, which can only be obtained rarely by digging at random around the level, and pull out at the last possible second in the fall. Some levels may have a ring or two placed outside normal reach just to make an A Rank impossible through that method. (Mad Space and Pyramid Cave are listed examples, discovered using Action Replay.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby">Kirby</a></em>:

</li><li> Also in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyTripleDeluxe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyTripleDeluxe">Triple Deluxe</a></em>, to get 100% Completion, you need to collect all of the keychains. There is one rare keychain per level, and there is almost no indication whether or not you are missing a level's rare keychain (Unlike regular keychains, rare keychains are fixed, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">unless you use a guide</a>, you're not gonna know which rare keychain you have or haven't obtained in which level).

Other than that, it's just as tedious.
</li></ul></li><li> A phrase "Veni, Vidi, Vici" reminds a lot of players of the extremely difficult to get Shiny Trinket in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VVVVVV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VVVVVV">VVVVVV</a></em>. Not only is it an order of magnitude more difficult to reach than any other trinket in the game, but your goal is separated from your start location only by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsurmountableWaistHeightFence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsurmountableWaistHeightFence">one waist-high block</a>, which any sane videogame protagonist would step over.

<ul><li> In nearly all of the games, the skill points will be a mystery until you earn them (you didn't even know their names until you'd beaten the game once in the first game; there are also some games that subvert the "Not Seeing the Skill Point description" thing, namely <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetDeadlocked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetDeadlocked">Deadlocked</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankAll4One" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankAll4One">All 4 One</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankIntoTheNexus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankIntoTheNexus">Into the Nexus</a></em>) and most of the challenge is figuring out what to do. However, there's almost always some skill point that's just plain hard, even if you know what to do (like in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankGoingCommando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankGoingCommando">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Going Commando</a></em>, where a Skill Point on Dobbo requires the player to kill all of the enemies with weapons from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2002" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2002">the first game</a>, which are MUCH weaker than the new game's weapons). Some of them are almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Permanently Missable</a> in Challenge Mode, since the criteria for the point also sometimes set the bar higher. Particularly annoying in <em>Size Matters</em>, where the point requirement for a space shooter minigame is set a lot higher in Challenge Mode...so much, in fact, that the best course of action may be to <em>start a new game</em> for 100% completion. The hoverboard race time trial skill points are also subject to this.

It involves getting tossing a Groovitron at every Enemy and NPC in the game to make them dance. Yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll">ALL of them.</a> The problem is, some enemies only appear in very specific places, and several are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Permanently Missable</a>, making them Last Lousy Points within a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastLousyPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastLousyPoint">Last Lousy Point</a>.

</li><li> "Vandal" in <em>Into the Nexus</em>. You have to break all of the windows on Planet Silox, which is hard because certain areas get blocked off after you complete the planet, and the windows you need to break are only different from the unbreakable ones due to being brighter blue, requiring you to always be looking everywhere in case one of these windows is not like the others.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> examples:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em> has 96 exits all up. Most levels after the first world have two possible exits. The hardest to find is almost certainly the exit that leads to Soda Lake in Cheese Bridge Area: you have to fly <em>under</em> the exit gate (without going off the bottom of the screen, of course)—going above it will end the level—and come to a landing on a platform <em>behind</em> it. It's not that hard for a skilled flyer, but you have to somehow figure it out or have a remarkably happy accident before you even know that's where it is. You can also use Yoshi to make it easier, but good luck maneuvering through the moving sawmills to reach the exit in the first place (Mario can't use the ropes when he's mounting Yoshi).
</li><li> Still having trouble finding exits in <em>Super Mario World</em>? Have you considered the path between Forest of Illusion 1 and Forest Ghost House? Both levels have a secret exit towards the other level, and both count towards the 96, which means the only path you might be "missing"... is a path you already have.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64">Super Mario 64</a></em> rewards the player for collecting 100 coins in any level with a star. That's all well and good, but some levels have <em>barely</em> enough coins to meet this requirement, including coins that only exist temporarily (one level has only 104 coins total). This leaves very little margin for error and often results in fruitless searches through the entire level to find those last few coins.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a></em>, the absolute final star, only available after collecting all 241 previous stars, amassing 9999 star bits, and beating the final boss twice is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">without question the hardest level since</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBrosTheLostLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBrosTheLostLevels">Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels</a></em>. It's an even harder version of Grandmaster Galaxy (the hardest level in the game) with Daredevil Comet in effect (meaning Mario has only one hitpoint) and no checkpoints. Six sections, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">three miserable Boomerang Bros</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell">zero mercy.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DWorld">Super Mario 3D World</a></em> requires you to beat all stages with all characters to get the maximum amount of completion stars on your profile. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And one of them isn't even available until you beat a certain level.</span> Of course, you can always play every stage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocializationBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocializationBonus">with friends</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but the five characters compared to the four-player limit still forces you to play them at least twice.</span> And before that, you have to complete Champion's Road, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of Grandmaster Galaxy. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And you have to complete it at least one more time.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioMaker">Super Mario Maker</a></em>, any of the five Mystery Mushroom costumes unlockable only through 100-Mario Challenge in Super Expert would count. The Super Expert difficulty was created a few months after the game's release to separate out the courses people were having a tough time with in Expert. Most Super Expert courses have clear rates below 2%, and you have to clear 6 of them in a row without losing all 100 of your Marios.
</li><li> Due to the sheer number of Power Moons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em>, it was inevitable that a few would end up in this territory. There are several candidates:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSidequest">infamous</a> 100 Jump Rope Challenge, and to a lesser extent, the 100 Volleyball Challenge. Most can get around 50-60 jumps before losing due to the extremely tight timing that requires nigh perfect regularity, and after one or two fails, most just don't feel like going through the whole thing again. Same largely goes for volleyball, except it is more forgiving, more manageable, and easily exploitable by using the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">two player mode to trivialize it</a>. The 100 Jump Rope Challenge can be trivialized even harder using a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">glitch</a>, but that's if you know that it exists and can pull it off.
</li><li> On The Eastern Pillar in the Sand Kingdom in the post-game. Not only does it require thinking seriously outside of the box (who would think to Capture a Bullet Bill and fly it that far out of the way?), it's quite the task to figure out how to maximize the Bullet Bill's range to reach it, and then you have to actually do it. Expect to run out of steam a split second before you hit home more than once.
</li><li> Hidden Room on the Flowing Sands in the Sand Kingdom. Fortunately, unlike most of the others on this list, it isn't difficult or tedious, just very hidden, but the Talkatoo and Hint Toad/Uncle Amiibo hints don't help much. For those who don't want to resort to a guide, this is one of the most elusive moons in the game.
</li><li> A Treasure Made of Coins in the Wooded Kingdom for the sheer cryptic nature of it. Who would think to Capture the Coin Coffer (which is difficult to spot in the very dark area in the first place) and then spit 500 coins onto a random plant in the pond? And since it's in the Deep Woods, its location hint doesn't even give you the exact location, only that it's in the Deep Woods.
</li><li> Almost every moon on the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dark Side</span> save for the hint art ones. First, a boss rush against all of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Broodals</a>, including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">their giant mech</span>. If that doesn't sound too hard, doing them back to back with little to no health refills in-between is several magnitudes harder than any individual fight. Most players resort to abusing amiibo, trudge back to the Odyssey after each one (each trip longer and more tedious than the last), or switch on Assist mode to refill health between the fights. And the other moons are from remixed challenges from earlier in the game, but with a twist that <em>seriously</em> ups the difficulty. The three hardest are probably Invisible Road: Rush! (traverse invisible platforms with harmful poison being spewed from Pirahna Plants as your only guide without Cappy to help clean up or jump over said poison), Vanishing Road Challenge (get through, on foot, platforming sections designed for the moped with a <em>very</em> strict time limit with no checkpoints without Cappy), and Breakdown Road Final Challenge (hope you can do 8 perfect long jumps in a row... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">without Cappy</a>, just for good measure).
</li><li> Long Journey's End, a middle ground between <em>Galaxy 2's</em> The Ultimate Test and The Perfect Run (you have more than one hitpoint, but no checkpoints). It's long, several sections are incredibly precise, and even experienced players will find their health eaten up right before the end thanks to the fourth-to-last challenge.
</li><li> Souvenir Savant, an Achievement Moon that requires you to have found almost all of the purple coins, which themselves are very subject to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastLousyPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastLousyPoint">Last Lousy Point</a>. By the end of the game, you will probably have at least several levels that are missing only one group of purple coins - and unlike the moons, purple coins aren't tracked on the map and the only in-game hints to their location require a Bowser amiibo. Without one, you'll have to either scour the levels or look up a guide and go through each and every one until you find the ones you missed.
</li><li> The 119 moons you have to buy from shops to max out the moon counter will eat up a wallet that's already been drained in the post-game due to the expensive costumes. Even by the time you get all of the normal moons, you will likely have to grind hard to get the 9999-coin costume piece, only to then grind again to get enough for all the moons (which come to 11900 coins - more than you can hold at once). Hope you like doing Luigi's Balloon World and/or that one mission in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bowser's Kingdom</span> dozens of times over, since they're the fastest ways to fill up on gold.

Many of them are just lying around, so exploring the dungeon will find them (in fact, it's hard/impossible to get <em>no</em> bones at all). Some need to be sniffed out and dug up. Some are gotten by killing enemies. Some by completing sidequests. And then, in the <em>first level</em>, are some bones that can only be gotten by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> herding pigeons towards a pigeon statue.</span> No hints are given that this is something you might want to do.

</li><li> The final Life Jewel in the Dimensional Corridor. You have to ride up to a platform on a miniboss' back, climb up to the screen above, stop a block at a very specific point with the Lamp of Time, and then pull off several tricky jumps through a spike-lined room to get it. You can't warp out of the Dimensional Corridor, you can't leave the room without killing the miniboss, and the Lamp of Time takes three minutes real-time to recharge after every attempt. Also, killing the miniboss will make it much, much harder to reach the upper screen where the Life Jewel is.

The number is written on your save so it's going to haunt you until you do! Well you're going to have to beat every stage in the game three times, once in each difficulty. Also, you'll have to beat all 8 Robot Masters with your buster to unlock them as playable. Then you'll have to beat every stage in the game three times with each Robot Master. Also, you'll unlock three alternate versions of Mega Man, one of which is deliberately terrible, and you'll have to beat the game three times each with those as well. Oh, and you'll also need to download Roll and beat the game three times with her, and either download or win Proto Man and do it three times with him. It doesn't matter if you download Proto Man or unlock him, because you unlock him by clearing the brutal Challenge Mode, and that's required for 100% as well! And then there's the unlockable level editor features. Oh, and even though it's a separate save file, you'll probably want to beat Classic Mode, a reskin of the original Mega Man, as well. To recap, you need to beat an insane challenge mode, fight the Robot Masters without weaknesses, find a mess of secrets, and also clear the game <em>43 times.</em>

Each racer also has a special movie that unlocked when you win a cup with them on Master Class difficulty. There are 41 characters, meaning you have to beat the hardest difficulty 41 times.

<ul><li> For <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a> of the compendium of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3: FES</a></em>, you need to unlock Orpheus Telos and fuse him. However, to actually get the ability to fuse him is that you must have every single social link maxed by the end of the game. It's nigh-impossible to complete this task <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">without a guide</a>: The game takes place over a typical school year with interruptions, and specific social links are only available on conflicting days — doubly so for the "girlfriend" social links, which break apart if you try to do multiples at once. In the original game, this involved spending every single day in the game in a very specific order (and intentionally getting one character angry at you); in the expansion, you have a few spare days at the end, but still cannot deviate from a <em>very</em> specific plan.
</li><li> The main obstacle to completing the Compendium in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PersonaQShadowOfTheLabyrinth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PersonaQShadowOfTheLabyrinth">Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth</a></em> is the "secret fusions", which don't appear in the compendium until you've made them and can only be fused by one specific combination of Personas. And some of Q's secret fusions weren't secret in earlier games (like Michael and Pale Rider), which might throw some players off.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> There are one or two special <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Legendary Pokémon</a> per game which are not available normally. These are usually obtained by storyline events, and with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGameForThePriceOfTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGameForThePriceOfTwo">One Game for the Price of Two</a> mechanic, you usually have to trade for the last one. Some normal creatures are also version-exclusive. That's not the Last Lousy Point. The Last Lousy Point for <em>Pokémon</em> games are the Mythical Pokémon- those Pokémon you cannot get without outside help, usually obtained via a special Nintendo event (or, for the more opportunistic, using a cheat device). They may show up on the GTS (barring the ribbon holding mons that can't be traded) but they go FAST when it isn't someone just looking to store it there by asking for something impossible like a level 9 Haunter<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5mrbs');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5mrbs" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5mrbs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Gastly evolves into Haunter at level 25</span>. Four of them can be gotten from spin-off games at any time, which can be extended to seven with a Japanese-only bonus disk and some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">glitch abuse</a>. Nintendo later started to repeat event distributions a lot more often than they used to, but it's still quite annoying. Thankfully, your Pokédex is generally treated as complete even if you don't have the event-only creatures.
</li><li> There are some things that only evolve by trading, so you had better have either multiple copies of the game or a friend who also plays it. In the first games, Golem couldn't even be <em>seen</em> without trading<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0q90d');"><sup>Note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0q90d" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0q90d');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">Japanese Blue</a>, where it was part of a trade with an NPC.</span>, since no NPC used it and there weren't any pictures of it lying around for your character to look at. Up until Gen VI, you couldn't request anything you hadn't seen, which made this sort of thing worse; now there's also an option to just type in a Pokémon's name.
</li><li> There are also some Pokémon that can only be obtained by trading them <em>while they are holding a specific item</em> (Kingdra, Steelix, etc). Said item naturally could only be found one time at one place once in the game. However, in later games, some trade-item evolution Pokémon like Steelix are available in the wild, and some of the required items can now be obtained as prizes for minigames. Some of items can also be held by some specific wild Pokémon, typically at a rather low chance, so you can avoid minigames and just try to encounter those exact species with a 'mon at the front of your party that has the ability Frisk<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6lkfz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6lkfz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6lkfz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which automatically tells you if the Pokémon you just encountered is holding an item, and what that item is</span> and the move Thief.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7wao0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7wao0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7wao0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">allowing you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KleptomaniacHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KleptomaniacHero">take said items</a></span> However, the "robbing the wildlife" method can still take hours.
</li><li> Feebas. It's found on six randomly chosen tiles in a gigantic pool of water, and thanks to the random encounter system there is no guarantee that you haven't found its tile already but didn't notice. The evolution of Feebas, Milotic, also counts. Without looking at a guide, it would be difficult to guess that the slimy bug-eyed brown Feebas would evolve into the beautiful brightly-colored serpent-like Milotic. Furthermore the only way to cause the evolution is to <em>make it beautiful by feeding it candies</em>, which is otherwise pointless outside of an optional minigame. And in order to get enough Beauty, it usually requires a Special Attack-boosting nature, decent to high quality Pokéblocks, and semi-rare berries to make the candy with. Even Game Freak realized this was too much work. In <em>HeartGold/SoulSilver</em>, due to the removal of treat making, Feebas could be evolved by getting it massaged. Of course, you can only do this once a day, for just one hour a day, and if you miss it, you've gotta wait 'til tomorrow. Possibly as an apology, in Black &amp; White, you can evolve your Feebas by trading it with an item attached, like many other Pokémon.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocializationBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocializationBonus">Socialization Bonus</a> requirement for getting Spiritomb is talking to people 32 times in the Underground. Add to the fact that one needs to leave and reenter the main part of the Underground to make repeated conversations count and it's a fairly tedious process for people who don't have anywhere near that many friends to play with. The only other way to get a Spiritomb lies within the Pokéwalker (a Pedometer with a Pokémon catching minigame built in) that was sold with Heart Gold/Soul Silver. Naturally this is still mind-numbingly hard, as you have to earn 100,000 watts to get the route Spiritomb's can be found on. At twenty steps a watt, you have to take two million steps before you unlock the route. At least this part is cumulative, once you get the route where you can get a Spiritomb, you still have to walk over 10,000 steps in a single day to have any sort of chance of actually seeing said Spiritomb, and even then the chances are still very low.
</li><li> All this just makes many a player glad they're not tasked to find the 1 in 8,192 odds of seeing the shiny form of each Pokémon. It's <em>impossible</em> even with access to every game since Generation III in which all Legendaries and Mythicals have been caught. Some Legendaries are specifically coded to never appear in their shiny form, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">said form only existing within the game's code for consistency's sake</a>. And event exclusives are distributed specifically in either normal <em>or</em> shiny form, with the event either giving out one or the other. Arceus wasn't available legitimately in its shiny form until Generation 6, and that event only took place in Japan.
</li><li> Chimecho in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire</a></em> and their remakes. 1% chance of finding it on the summit of Mt. Pyre, which you'll probably only visit for the plot (or the awesome music), and a catch rate lower than some Legendary Pokémon. And since no trainers have one outside of one place with randomly-generated battles, you may not even know it exists unless you have a player's guide or look at internet walkthroughs. To add insult to injury, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JunkRare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JunkRare">it's one of the weakest Psychic-types in the whole series</a>. Thankfully, its baby form is easily found in Generation 4.
</li><li> Another third gen problem is Skitty. It's found in one area of one route, but at only 2% chance of finding it, good luck and lots of patience are required. And in Gen IV, you had to wait for a swarm after you beat the game. It explains the fact that so few Skitty were found on the GTS up until Gen VI, when they finally became a more common early-game encounter. Occasionally Skitty swarm their route in Gen III as well, which relieves the pressure slightly.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonMysteryDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonMysteryDungeon">Pokémon Mystery Dungeon</a></em> series, you have Kecleon. You have to be level 90 or higher, have the Friend Bow (in the Rescue Team subtitles) or Golden Mask (in the Explorer subtitles, on top of Fast Friend skill) equipped. Then you need to find a Kecleon Shop, get an item and choose not to pay for it. Kecleon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyAngeredShopkeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyAngeredShopkeeper">will then call some friends to attack you</a>. You have one in a thousand (in Rescue Team) or one in two hundred (Explorer) chance of recruiting one. And in the Rescue Team subtitles, if you do get lucky and recruit one, you have to make it off the floor with your recruit alive, or else try again. Escape Orbs do not work, by the way.
</li><li> There are few other Pokemon in <em>Rescue Team</em> that can count this, not because they're hard to beat like Kecleon, but the effort to encounter just a single one in a dungeon that actually allows recruiting, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMons">Pidgey</a> who spawns 1.5% of the time on few specific floors of a single dungeons, or Ponyta who spawns only deep in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGearLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGearLevel">Joyous Tower</a>.
</li><li> In <em>Sun and Moon</em>, the Zygarde Cores and Cells are scattered throughout the games' world. Some are found inside early area houses you otherwise don't have the need to enter, and what's even worse, some are only visible only during the day, or only at night, meaning you'll almost certainly miss some of them. In fact, there are numerous stories on the internet of people missing one Zygarde Cell and had to recheck all areas with the help of a guide. In the same games, there are some Pokémon that will only show up as allies in SOS battles with other Pokémon, meaning you could go through the entire game without ever seeing one of them outside of trainer battles.

By the time you get access to weapons with the Capture ability on them, catching monsters from earlier levels is fairly easy, and you can capture monsters in later levels as you're clearing them for story purposes. There is, however, one monster called Tonberry who has the lowest appearance rate of any monster in the game. You can run around for hours in the Cavern of the Stolen Fayth without seeing even one, and you'll almost definitely have caught 10 of the other monsters<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9uvew');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9uvew" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9uvew');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">including his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">upgraded</a> version in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Omega Ruins</a></span> in the game before then.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2">Final Fantasy X-2</a></em>:
<ul><li> If you miss talking to the Moogle-Suit person (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Who turns out to be the real Yuna in disguise</span>) towards the beginning, while pursuing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the fake Yuna</span>, you'll lose 100% completion.
</li><li> The Dresspheres, and the Garment Grids - the best Dressphere in the game, the Mascot, is unlocked by talking to the innkeeper. In all five chapters. As well as get an Episode Complete in the final chapter for <em>every</em> location in the map, with every location being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> in itself, because if you mess up early in the game on the Mi'hen Highroad and don't get a specific outcome of the machine malfunctioning mystery there, you lose the Episode Complete and the chance to get the Mascot on this run.
</li><li> As for the Garment Grids, the last one you get gives you the intrinsic ability to use a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> ability - if you <em>never</em> run from a battle during <em>the entire game.</em> It is also unlocked by viewing every possible enemy in its Oversoul mode - an annoying challenge that virtually requires fleeing from enemies regularly (thank goodness the Grid and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> carries over into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>). Bottom line - Only about 40% of the game is completed if you just run through, and that other 60% is VERY easy to miss something out from, so if you want everything, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">buy a strategy guide (or better yet, check gamefaqs.com), or get ready to reset constantly.</a>
</li><li> And even if the player goes through Touching The Moogle early on and everything, the player can still end up with exactly 1% missing for the wanted 100%. All because you did not pick the 'right' choice at the beginning of Chapter 2.
</li><li> Getting all the powers for the Blue Mage is an exercise in frustration, given that some of them are specific to boss characters who can be missed in a given play-through based on which choices you made in a given chapter, and even if you made the right choice to face that particular boss, they rarely use the power.

<ul><li> The Rare Game are this trope personified. There are 80, and each of them have certain conditions to spawn in specific areas, ranging from simple (40% chance to spawn when you enter, 20% chance to spawn after killing a certain enemy) to the tedious (wait in this area for X amount of time, kill X number of creatures) to the outright batshit insane (kill all the enemies in this area before anything respawns, then leave and return).
</li><li> While not as bad as Rare Game, filling out your Clan Primer can be just as infuriating. You might need to kill 10 of a particular enemy, and only one spawns in the area you're in, forcing you to move two areas away to make everything respawn so you can kill them again.
</li><li> The monsters in Barheim Passage deserve special mention: If you want the entries for Zombies and Specters, you must allow the Battery Mimics to drain the power...and then survive the undead onslaught. You can get them later, but Zombies appear in the Tomb of Raithwall (which you won get to for another 10 or so character leves) and the Specters reappear as enemies in the secret areas of Barheim...at almost level 40!

<ul><li> Trying to get the Monster Collection fragment is particularly painful, as it requires you to defeat every enemy in the game, some of which are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Bosses</a> capable of stomping you and many rare monsters that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">pretty much require a guide to even find</a>.
</li><li> The Lucky Coin requires you to win 7,777 coins at the slots in Serendipity. Against a <em>very</em> realistic slot machine, where there's no way to game the reels, rig the machine, or really do anything unless you have superhuman reflexes and a photographic memory. And if you do what some guides recommend and put a rubber band on the 'autoplay' button, then it cuts your chances of winning anything by <em>33%</em>.
</li><li> The Travel Guide: Academia fragment. It requires you to get 100% exploration on all Academia maps. Academia 400 AF is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">That One Level</a>, Academia 4XX AF is a massive sprawling city with <em>dozens</em> of obscure little nooks and crannies, and Academia 500 AF is a <em>platformer</em> level with many out of the way platforms that are insanely hard to reach. Even worse, getting all the Travel Guide fragments unlocks the Battlemania Fragment Skill, which increases the chance of rare monsters spawning, and is something you'll definitely want to get.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game is kind enough to not keep track of completion percentage, but it STILL manages to drive the player insane by having an obscure "treasure hunter ranking" that tracks how many treasures you collect. This includes many "key items" that can be lost forever, one of which is because the guy who gives it to you needs three very easily missable key items and he DIES in the fourth disk — and no, you can't just steal it from his house. Many of the missable items are chests that, for some reason, get refilled (so you miss the chance to gain their previous contents), during periods when you have no reason to be anywhere near their locations.
</li><li> Several of those key items are only available by playing very, very repetitive mini-games that don't otherwise grant a player any other rewards beyond non-unique Tetra Master cards (which aren't good for anything beyond playing Tetra Master anyway) long past most people's patience level. The worst of all is the Athlete Queen, which has a very small window of opportunity to get, and has you race against an NPC until he reaches racing level 80. His level only increases when you win, and he eventually becomes extremely difficult to beat. Good luck trying to get the Excalibur II in a perfect game if you count the Athlete Queen, as the limited window means you can't put it off until later.
</li><li> Several of the best items that will help your party — with stats and by giving you abilities you otherwise couldn't get — have to be synthesised from weaker items that you probably already sold, or can be bought in stores that have already been destroyed, or are locked away in a town that was enveloped by giant tree roots.
</li><li> Equipment that boosts stats also boosts stat GROWTH, meaning that you have to wear it starting at level 1 to get the maximum benefit out of it. Some of the best stat-boosting equipment is only available on disc four, and to get that far still at level 1 you need to run from every battle, find special "friendly monsters" to gain ability points, and use obscure strategies for many bosses. And to make matters worse, you have to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">Marcus</a> during the short period he is in your party to level 99, because Eiko later inherits his stat bonuses, but not his level (contrary to Amarant, who inherits Blank's level). Of course this also means you can't get perfect stats and Excalibur II in the same game.
</li><li> Steiner's Excalibur II can only be found in the last dungeon of the game (the game is four disks long) and you have to get there before the twelve-hour mark to get it (else you have to keep the game on for TWO YEARS to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">overflow the game clock</a>). There's a guide online that perfected this challenge, showing that it's possible to get the Excalibur II <strong>and</strong> all missable items and remain at level 1 for stat gains. It'll take you hours to read it.
</li><li> The nearly sole reason why many treasures, items, and events are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> was due to Square releasing an online system alongside the game that told you where everything was, but to actually use the system proper, you needed a strategy guide published by Square which wasn't an actual strategy guide at all. Instead, the "guide" contained codes you used on Square's website to obtain the information.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em> has a few Last Lousy Bestiary Entries for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAchievement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAchievement">"Know-It-All" achievement</a>:
<ul><li> "General" (encountered while protecting Rydia in Kaipo) and "Captain" (encountered in the defense of Fabul) will run away if their henchmen are killed first and are only encountered during those times. You must kill them first to get their entries.
</li><li> The boss fight with Dr. Lugae and Barnabas features two mutually-exclusive entries. If you kill Barnabas first, Lugae will take control of his creation and allow you to fight his upgraded form, Barnabas-Z. However, you won't get the "Doctor" entry if you do this. Likewise, if you kill Lugae first, you get his entry, but you won't get to fight Barnabas-Z for that entry, thus requiring a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">second playthrough</a> for both "Doctor" and "Barnabas-Z".
</li><li> To get all the entries for the Calcabrina dolls, you must kill one of one type, then all three of the other type, then the fusion form.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> fight with Proto-Babil requires Edge to steal an item from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> in a previous playthrough in order to access it.
</li></ul></li><li> The Windows Phone and Steam remakes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII">Final Fantasy III</a></em> also have their share of this.
<ul><li> Similar to Final Fantasy IV, collecting all the bestiary entries and opening the treasure chests for the<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAchievement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAchievement">"Filling Up The Grotesquerie" and "I, My, Me, Mine" achievements</a>. The majority of dungeons contain encounters so rare that you may never know they exist, and towns and dungeons are filled with secret passageways, making chests easily missable. Moreover, certain dungeons can only be entered once, making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">one mistake</a> game-ending for completionists. And if that wasn't enough, the only way to review your bestiary and treasure hunting progress until the end of the game is by talking to an NPC located in an optional town in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">secret passageway of an inn.</a>
</li><li> The bestiary achievement can only be unlocked by defeating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>. But due to the unreliability of Mognet and a lack of consensus on non-DS ports of how to trigger events needed to access this boss, certain players have reported unable to finish this particular side quest.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries">Tales Series</a></em>, there is a considerable amount of this.
<ul><li> There's the usual 100% items, monsters, weapons, armor, etc. But then there are the skits. The optional, story or even completion level dependent cutscenes that pop up. They can be easy to miss, since they don't instantly start, and only give that option after a few seconds pause. If you're hurrying along, you can easily miss them. Some are only available in ONE specific room after ONE specific event. Also, they usually have their own completion counter, and when some skits only show up on certain story paths, of which there can be more than one, you have to play through the game more than once.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em> must be completed three different times to even have a chance at 100%.
<ul><li> Made worse in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> on the PS2 (Which is what the PS3 version is based off of.), where in order to get all the titles, you must complete the game a few more times with to get the new costumes for everybody (except for Raine, who gets hers from the Casino.) And what's worse is that certain characters will give two titles, one for them and one for the person they're closest to (Picking Genis' best friend scene will nab both his and Presea's costumes.) But if you pick somebody else only they will get a title (Picking Presea will only get her costume and not Genis'.)
</li><li> If going for 100% completion including the skits, you're going to have to play the game 8 times, as every character has their own skit if you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">pick their ending</a>.
</li><li> Even worse, to get 100% on the Collectors Book you have to get Zelos as your best friend. The guy barely trusts you when he joins the team and takes a lot to win over. Even if you do everything right it may still take more than one playthrough to get him. Oh, and some of the choices that make him like you more have a negative effect on other people (like the equally difficult Presea, who fortunately doesn't give you anything for the Collector's Book).
</li><li> And just as bad is Genis' strongest weapon, One World. To get it you need to beat 99.9% of the game. See, after you open the door to the final boss there's a scene and a teleporter to the boss. Instead of fighting the boss, you need to leave the room and go play a minigame that offered mundane prizes before now (you're not actually told the prize is better now). The minigame is very difficult. If you win, you get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity Plus One Kendama</a>. This is likely to be the last item you get in the Collector's Book.

<ul><li> Those last points will probably come from the Din's Shop weapons, seeing as the game never tells you exactly what you can find there, or how many points they cost (with Dymlos, the most expensive weapon in the shop, costing 160 points). And you only get a measly one or two points for most of items you bring in, and only certain items give points towards each category. There's a damn good reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GameFAQs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a> has a whole guide dedicated to this shop.
</li><li> The <em>Full Metal Edge</em> and <em>Golden Armor</em>: as a reward of a sidequest, you must pick one of the two, so you need a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> and pick a different option on it to have both registered into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll">Collector's Book</a>.
</li><li> The US version has a bug that makes one skit scene (<em>#266: Poor Thing</em>) unable to start. You can still watch it on the Skit Scene Viewer in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, but you'll never get it on the game itself, and it won't count for your completion status.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Last Lousy Vivosaurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FossilFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FossilFighters">Fossil Fighters</a></em> are a quintet of baby birds, one for each element (minus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneElement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneElement">Legendary</a>). Their abilities aren't generally <em>that</em> special, but the only way to get them? To get every other viviosaur in the game and <strong>max out their levels.</strong> <em>That'll</em> keep you busy for a while... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However, it is possible to play with the Neutral-type one, Squirk, early if you get lucky using Aoptryx's Ancient Power "Transformation" ability.</span>
</li><li> The Last Lousy Monster in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterRancher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterRancher">Monster Rancher</a> Advance 2</em> is Octochrome. The only way to get it is by raising an Octopee monster to S-rank, and then waiting to be randomly attacked by it. If you beat it, you get a code for it. The problem? Thanks to a glitch, it's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">totally unobtainable.</a></em> Well, unless you break out the cheat device.

If you miss something along the way, never fear. Completion of the game allows you to return to any point in the game and redo any challenge or find anything you may have missed. There are two catches, both involving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Pork City</a>:
<ul><li> The Pig Noise you defeat in this dungeon are the only ones that get recorded in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterCompendium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterCompendium">Noise Report</a>. They drop the same thing on all four difficulties, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">defeating just one records all four drops</a>, but the Noise Report <em>also</em> records the lowest level at which you've beaten a particular Noise. If you want a neat grid of "Lv 1" throughout the whole thing, you'd better go in at level 1/*, because if you level up during battle the Noise Report sees that you won at level 2.
</li><li> The Pig Mazurka, encountered only once, is the only Noise that drops pin #300, "Pig". If you see its sell value of a whopping 250000 yen and decide to sell it for some quick cash, you've just screwed yourself out of 100% pin mastery. Even in their home base, Pig Noise <em>never</em> respawn.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatenKaitos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatenKaitos">Baten Kaitos</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first one, the Last Lousy Magnus is usually either the Frost Cap (dropped by one enemy in the Trail of Souls, which you visit once), the Splendid Hair (age Shampoo for <em>336 hours real-time</em>), or the Maskless Mizuti Shots (two pictures taken of one of your characers while in the middle of a very specific boss battle, one of which has a minuscule chance of appearing). All with an extra helping of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Permanently Missable Content</a>, as none of these are even hinted at in game and many of them are only available once.
</li><li> In the second game, several Magnus are easily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Permanently Missable</a> and some others require obscenely long aging times or convoluted magnus mix recipes. And this is not possible anyway if you don't have a copy of the first game (or at least a save file of it), otherwise your harmless Soul Jar can't be upgraded and you miss three magnus.
</li></ul></li><li> The Frequent Friend trophy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts3DDreamDropDistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts3DDreamDropDistance">Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance</a></em> is a huge pain to get, thanks to it requiring the use of the game's StreetPass functions, which are rather unreliable when it comes to exchanging data with other players. If you don't have any friends with the game, it basically becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a>, due to the ability to StreetPass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">Non Player Characters</a> being seemingly broken in the English version, meaning you'll just have travel everywhere hoping you pass someone <em>and</em> get the StreetPass to go through properly.
</li><li> Players aiming for 100% in the Trinity Archives in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep">Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep</a></em> may run into some trouble, for even after completing the individual reports of the three characters, the Item Collection screen may still be at 98 or 99%. There's no consensus on what makes up these last points, with some people saying you need to acquire all the special keyblades with the three characters (which implies beating what may be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a></em> of the entire series three times), while others point to the completely useless arena ticket itens and recipes (none of which go in the reports section and cost a lot of medals). Even if you manage to get the Item Collection to 100% quickly, you still have to play for at least 80 hours for a trophy.
</li><li> For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EtrianOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EtrianOdyssey">Etrian Mystery Dungeon</a></em>, many drops for the Item Almanac could qualify, such as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareRandomDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareRandomDrop">Rare Random Drop</a> from the rarest-occuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">D.O.E.</a> in a dungeon where 4 different ones could show up (and that's just the worst of the D.O.E. rare drops), or a sword which requires 2 rare drops each from the three dragon bosses. But arguably the king of this trope is the Green Shard from the Demented King in the 61-floor Phantom Depths, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel">Marathon Level</a> which starts you at Level 1 with no items and must be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckpointStarvation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckpointStarvation">completed without checkpoints</a>. Clearing the dungeon once is a feat in itself. Summoning the willpower to beat it multiple times for the rare Purple Shard, which has a 15% drop rate, is another. The Green Shard? You have a 1 in 20 chance of getting it, and it takes hours to get just one drop from the Demented King. The reward? All of his drops create a shield which is only minimally stronger than the others. Even adventurers who have the perseverance to collect the other rare drops tend to get stumped here.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarNova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarNova">Phantasy Star Nova</a></em> has the "Mark of a Hero King" Trophy, which requires you to kill 11,111 enemies. That doesn't sound too bad, until you realize that the Quest with the most enemies only has <em>110</em> targets. It's almost certain that you won't get it without going out of your way just to kill a lot of things.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperdimensionNeptuniaReBirth1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperdimensionNeptuniaReBirth1">Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1</a></em> has the "Millionaire" trophy which requires you to get 100 million credits... which requires a LOT of grinding. The quickest and easiest way to do this without the DLC is to keep killing Clione, an enemy with high HP and defense, restoring health on every turn, over and over, because it drops a lot of credits. Which, with the right equipment and attacks used, isn't as hard as much as it's just tiring to do over and over. Also, just getting the dungeon containing this enemy in the first place requires several rounds of dungeon crafting from random boss-fight drops... With the DLC packs (which lets you go beyond level 99) it's slightly faster and more varied, but still grindy - after you reach certain levels you can safely start fighting stronger versions of the same enemy dropping more coins, and eventually move on to even higher-leveled "tournament" fights with higher payoff... still doing this over and over.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OneWayHeroics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OneWayHeroics">One Way Heroics</a></em> has the Dosey Plus ending, which requires the player to find a very rare Parchment of Darkness, which will take a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a> at scroll shops at around 1000km or greater. Once they have that, they'll have to max Dosey's affection and beat the Demon Lord before she transforms into a Killer Hound, which is no easy feat even if the player already prepared her favorite food. While the other endings are harder in terms of gameplay, Dosey Plus is far more lucked-based.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NocturneRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NocturneRebirth">Nocturne: Rebirth</a></em> has an item glossary, which is hard to fill out due to how some items can't be obtained through forging or shops at all and instead can only be obtained through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareRandomDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareRandomDrop">Rare Random Drop</a> or a random Brave Clear reward.

It gets to the point where several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> runs are needed to even get a decent shot at getting some of these. Even though the game is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> in terms of combat, actually beating and Brave Clearing all the bosses is considered far easier than filling out the item glossary.

Many players had gotten 29 out of 30 boxes and were stumped to see that the last missing one was in the main hallway inside the Mushroom Kingdom's castle. How do you get it? Jump on Toad's head as he opens the door when you enter the castle for the first time and then jump up above the doorway to reach the box. Missed it and saved afterwards? Too bad, start the game over. At the very least, the box only contains a frog coin.

To gain them, you have to defeat stronger versions of the game's main bosses. Some of them really make it hard to get their strongest Mega Cards and if anything, it's much easier to get the rest of the Standard and Giga library since you don't have to run around trying to find the boss just to delete them for their cards.
</li><li> The last few medals in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Miitopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Miitopia">Miitopia</a></em> can be a <em><strong>real</strong></em> pain to get.

Turns out that it was only available immediately after a specific cutscene way back in Chapter 2, when Cornelia walked off and left the door to her hotel room open.
</li><li> There are six Rare NES Games, which can be used to unlock special moves for each character. Four of the games are easy to collect, but the last two will have you pulling your hair out.

This includes going out of your way to back-attack enemies in the early chapters, before you can even acquire Look-Behind-Yous to facilitate this. Several enemies are also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">exclusive to earlier chapters</a> so you miss out on their data entry if you finish a chapter too soon.

Said Paper Broozer won't drop them normally: it must first use a certain attack (out of three possible ones) to attack the bros. This attack throws a number of barrels that the bros must break with their hammers. Upon doing that, each barrel has a chance to contain loot. Said loot is usually coins, with a small chance to contain a rare item which has <em>a one in seven chance</em> of being the Wellington Boots, the other six possible drops being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareCandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareCandy">Beans</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetpassMiiPlaza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetpassMiiPlaza">Streetpass Mii Plaza</a></em>'s <em>Mii Force/Streetpass Squad</em>, the very last Treasure a player is most likely to find will be one awarded upon defeating two specific enemies simultaneously. There are three of these in the game, and all of the enemies involved are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSponge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSponge">Damage Sponge</a> types, you get no health bar to make sure you can nail those last hits at the same time, and the enemies move around the screen. As it's a Streetpass game, it's not a matter of trying again and again—after you've screwed up three times, you'll have to gather up some more Miis and try again.
</li><li> In <em>Viper Phase 1</em>, your end-of-stage bonus is multiplied by 100 if you kill every last enemy in the stage. If you so much as miss <em>one</em> enemy, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v6I1sGbezw">your multiplier will drop to 50<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Because the game screen shifts depending on your horizontal position, it is possible to lose that x100 multiplier because of an enemy you didn't even <em>see.</em> You can also lose that multiplier by getting killed, as it takes a few seconds after you die to respawn on the screen and attack again, and enemies may escape during that delay. Don't even think about going for a world-class score if you can't clear the non-boss portion of each stage on one life.

There's a camouflage available that lets you hear Kerotans in a room or screen you haven't shot yet, so you know to keep looking for them. The real problem is the Kerotans <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you need to shoot during the bike chase scene</span>. You only get about a second to line up a proper shot, and seldom have the time after making a shot to listen for the sound they make to confirm that you even got it. Save-scumming is the only safe option. Failing to get the Kerotan Rank after being completely sure you got all the Kerotans in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the bike scene</span> is, to say the least, highly distressing.

The ones with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAchievement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAchievement">lowest achieved percentages</a> will be the ones which fit this trope.

If less than 5% of game owners have a particular trophy, then...yep, you guessed it.
</li></ul></li><li> Resting your GamerScore on a number that isn't a multiple of 5 will likely cause a modicum of annoyance. Harmonix played on this obsession with nice, neat numbers with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand">Rock Band</a> 3</em> where there is an easy-to-earn Achievement worth 4 GS (you're likely to stumble on it during your first couple of plays). To get that number to a smooth 10 and set the universe back in order you have to earn a 6 point Achievement for linking your account with the <em>Rock Band</em> website for stat tracking.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoubleDragonNeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoubleDragonNeon">Double Dragon Neon</a></em> gives you 1 GS for <em>starting</em> the game, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> mocking you with a "Now finish what you started!" as its description. Clearing the game and defeating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> will net you the remaining 19 GS. Not too tough, but very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">annoying</a>.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball">pinball</a>, this is known as a "<a class="urllink" href="http://funwithbonus.com/new-pinball-dictionary-gatekeeper-concept/">gatekeeper<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>," named so because such an objective or collectible item effectively blocks the player's way towards total victory. Some notable examples include:
<ul><li> "Complete All Scenes" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/TheShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/TheShadow">The Shadow</a></em>. "Khan Multiball" and "Shadow Multiball" only require you lock enough balls to start them, and "Complete the Battlefield" only needs 100 switch hits on one part of the playfield (which is small, compact, and full of bounciness so it counts up rapidly). Each Scene is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">timed</a> and all require a minimum of four shots. It is not uncommon for even experts to have finished the other three while having only finished two or three scenes (or even just one or none at all).
</li><li> The light labeled as "Illusions" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/TheatreOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/TheatreOfMagic">Theatre of Magic</a></em> is also incredibly difficult. "Theatre" may require 7 left orbit shots and "Midnight" may require 12 right orbit shots, but each Illusion requires a minimum of 4 hits to the Magic Trunk and there are 8 Illusions in all. The saving grace is that Illusions don't have to be completed, just started, to count towards lighting "Illusions."
</li><li> "Davy Jones Defeated" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanStern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanStern">Pirates of the Caribbean (Stern)</a></em> requires that you've sunk all four ships, and only then do you even have a chance at dueling against Davy Jones, let alone defeating him. "Heart Super Jackpot Completed" could count too, as Heart Multiball is difficult to even begin because the game is choosy about letting you advance towards it, and you have to perform exceptionally well at Heart Multiball for the Super Jackpot to appear. Both of these goals require by far the largest amount of shots to complete. <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> pairs objectives with cardinal directions, and it is probably no coincidence that both of these objectives are assigned to the East sector—it is the cardinal direction with the greatest reward (a Special, which under default conditions is a free game).
</li><li> It's a bit more complicated with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/TheSopranos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/TheSopranos">The Sopranos</a></em>. Under normal circumstances, "Episodes" would be the one that's the most troublesome and the longest to achieve, as unlike the other goals, this objective is actually five objectives (not unlike with <em>The Shadow</em> or <em>Theatre of Magic</em> above). However, the game is absolutely fine with the player letting the timer run out for all five Episodes. If the player chooses to do this, then "R.I.P." becomes the gatekeeper, as it requires you bury all eight characters as displayed on the top-right by lighting the R, I, and P letters in that corner eight times.
