</div></div><p>A Straw Vulcan is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarOnStraw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarOnStraw">straw man</a> that is used to show that emotion is better than logic.
</p><p>It starts by having characters who think "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord">logically</a>" try to solve a problem - and they can't. Either they can't find any answer, or they're caught in some kind of standoff, or every answer they can think of has some tradeoff that's unacceptable to the other characters, or they're even stuck in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb">Logic Bomb</a>-type loop. Once this is established, someone who uses good old human emotion comes up with a solution that the logical thinker can't. This provides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> that emotion is superior and that the logical thinker shouldn't trust logic so much.

</p><p>The most common mistake is to assume that logic and emotion are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseDichotomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseDichotomy">somehow naturally opposed and that employing one means you can't have the other</a> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0rppr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0rppr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0rppr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For some more information, see <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_marker_hypothesis">Somatic marker hypothesis<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. While there are criticisms, the hypothesis makes the case of emotion being a bigger foundation of rational decision making that one may think</span>. Excluding emotion doesn't make your reasoning logical, however, and it certainly doesn't cause your answer to be automatically true. Likewise, an emotional response doesn't preclude logical thinking — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">although it may prevent you from thinking in the first place</a> — and if a plan someone defended for emotional reasons is successful, that doesn't make logic somehow wrong.
</p><p>The word "emotion" is often used here in places where "intuition" or "instinct" might be more accurate: <em>i.e.,</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontThinkFeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontThinkFeel">instances where the subconscious mind reaches a correct answer faster than the conscious mind can perform a step-by-step reasoned analysis</a> (such as, "Run!" or "Shoot!" or "I get a trustworthy vibe from this stranger,"); or feats of lateral thinking that involve bypassing the sort of rigid categorization systems that western philosophy traditionally favors. <em>This</em> sort of thing is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">perfectly legitimate</a> dichotomy, but the issue is rarely described this way, instead calling it "logic vs. emotion," which is probably less accurate.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Because the writers are more concerned with setting up their straw man than in handling logic correctly, they will often misuse and distort the concept to create contrived examples where what they're calling "logic" doesn't work. Common situations include:
</p><ul><li> The Straw Vulcan is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded">Literal-Minded</a>. Note that the idea that an "intelligent" character wouldn't "get" the concept of metaphors, idioms or sarcasm isn't very logical.
</li><li> The Straw Vulcan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentScully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentScully">cannot believe in the paranormal</a>. Logical enough in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, where the existence of such forces is debated and unproven scientifically (often becoming quackery), but this can lead to such characters coming off as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">blind or in denial</a> if they live in a universe where such things are shown to be real. Such a portrait of blindness then might delegitimize skepticism in general towards the paranormal, by association of ideas.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> The Straw Vulcan will often commit the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallacyFallacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallacyFallacy">Fallacy Fallacy</a>, dismissing a conclusion simply because it was based on invalid logic or on emotion. The fact that an argument contains a fallacy does not prove that the conclusion is wrong.
</li><li> The Straw Vulcan will proceed to disturb everyone with doomsaying that their current plan "only has a 10% chance for us to succeed", and then the emotional protagonist proceeds to disprove him by saying "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTellMeTheOdds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTellMeTheOdds">Never Tell Me the Odds!</a>" and succeeding. Actually, when all other options are depleted, the plan that has a 10% chance of success is logically superior to other courses of action that have less chance of success. (And presumably doing nothing means a 0% chance.) Bothering people with remarks about low chances of success in critical situations may degrade their morale and thus further diminish said chances, so it doesn't make logical sense to quote poor odds unless there's a better option that can be taken.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11zcs');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11zcs" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11zcs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Or the "logical" character forgot to factor the other characters' personalities into the equation, so telling the others it's unlikely to work actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspirationalInsult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspirationalInsult">makes it MORE likely they'll try harder than usual and therefore succeed</a>, just to prove the "logical" character wrong.</span> Pessimism for pessimism's sake in a time of need simply isn't logical, no need to be the sensitive guy of the cast to figure <em>that</em> out.
</li><li> In general, Straw Vulcans will often act as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCynic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCynic">The Cynic</a> and consider <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyRabbitIdealismIsForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyRabbitIdealismIsForKids">the more idealistic choice as illogical and improbable</a>, even though there's no direct logical connection between logic and pessimism. While being logical can sometimes come off as pessimistic or cynical - such as pointing out how crying isn't going to help a situation (because it usually really doesn't) - logic itself does not lean on either side of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism">Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism</a>.
</li><li> There's also the case where the emotional person suggests a course that shouldn't work, period, but the Straw Vulcan's ideas all involve some aspect that the "non-logical" character find cynical or objectionable. So Straw Vulcan is outvoted, they go with the dumb emotional plan, and lo, it works... due to sheer dumb luck. This is then lauded as a victory for emotion, when in fact it's a victory for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionToOneChance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionToOneChance">Million-to-One Chance</a> principle.
</li><li> The story assumes a "logical" plan is one where every step makes the goal visibly closer, and accepting a short-term disadvantage for a long-term advantage is not "logical". There's nothing inherently illogical in accepting a short-term set-back if it makes the long-term success more likely. (This is in fact studied in algorithmics: a step that visibly takes you closer to the goal may eventually run you into a dead end if you don't consider alternatives.).
</li><li> The Straw Vulcan is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad">cold-hearted and merciless</a>. When they (for whatever reason) calculate that some people have to die (or suffer in another way) because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedsOfTheMany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedsOfTheMany">The Needs of the Many</a> requires it, they just <em>have to</em>, and there's nothing you can do about it (and expect them to toss those people to the wolves at the earliest possible time). Enter the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMcCoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMcCoy">emotional man</a> to show pity and protect them from the evil intellectual.
</li><li> The Straw Vulcan is an intellectual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy">Arrogant Kung-Fu Guy</a>. If, for example, his calculations showcase that there is a 98.99% chance of success in a plan and another scientist proves that there is a 100% chance of success in the same plan (and they both reach the same conclusions using the same data and using the same calculation methods, but the Straw Vulcan is not discovered until later that he forgot to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarryTheOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarryTheOne">Carry the One</a>), the Straw Vulcan will simply clamp down on that 1.01% chance of failure as an <em>absolute</em> probability of failure and drag his feet into helping as a result (at best) rather than admit the infinitesimally small chance that he's wrong.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitrarySkepticism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitrarySkepticism">Arbitrary Skepticism</a> is a hat that he keeps at hand all of the time. Even if the character has encountered every single damn weird thing under the sun and then some, it is impossible for him to accept the appearance of something new that doesn't fits within the rules of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">Magic A Is Magic A</a> or the other kinds of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumDuJour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumDuJour">Phlebotinum du Jour</a> in the series because as far as he knows, those rules supposedly say that this weird thing cannot happen, and so logically it is <em>not</em> happening, <em>period</em> (so he can accept <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel">Faster-Than-Light Travel</a>, aliens, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantAIJustAddWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantAIJustAddWater">Instant A.I.: Just Add Water!</a>, telepathy, telekinesis, the existence of Atlantis, alternate dimensions, ghosts, and even the theory of all of these together <em>somehow</em> were involved in the assassination of JFK, but cats and dogs living together? Nope). Any scientist worth their salt is always (and must always be) open to the possibility that there is <em>always</em> stuff that has not been encountered, and if that phenomenon exists, then what does that says about the laws that have been theorized (not that they are wrong, maybe, just that whoever made them hadn't encountered <em>this</em> particular situation), and is it possible to replicate the results? A lot of the time this is tied to the above bullet point, doubly so if the Straw Vulcan is the one who discovered whatever the phenomenon is putting under question. Sometimes this applies to the paranormal, but if a writer decides to do stuff like add <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> to his show, then obviously the Straw Vulcan will be the first to call it hogwash.
</li><li> As a result of many items above, expect the Straw Vulcan to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">Flat-Earth Atheist</a> and running on the fallacy that either gods don't exist because their influence cannot be proven and if it <em>is</em> possible to prove it, well then, that means they aren't "gods", right? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAliens">Sufficiently Advanced Aliens</a>, maybe, and <em>that's</em> being generous.
</li></ul><p>Note that the application of some of these does not inherently make a character a Straw Vulcan. If a logical thinker finds it difficult to predict the actions of irrational people, and it is portrayed as a character flaw or limitation, then it is not this trope. It is only this trope if this is treated as a problem of logical thinking itself, rather than as a character-specific problem.
</p><p>This trope was explored (and TV Tropes namechecked) in a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv1nMc-k0N4">speech by Julia Galef<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> at Skepticon 4 in 2011.

<ul><li> Rossiu touches on this after the time-skip; when the citizens are rioting over the destruction caused by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Anti-Spirals</span>, he tries to placate the populace by having Simon arrested and scheduled for execution, since Simon is technically responsible for the actions that led to the villain's attacking them (even though everyone else did just as much) and caused a lot of property damage by destroying an enemy in a populated area. He also wants to have the Gunmen and Lagann destroyed because they're outdated technology, and tries to save humanity by having them hide underground or evacuate on a spaceship. When this turns out to be futile, Simon saves the day by kicking reason to the curb and breaking through the impossible. That being said, Rossiu is not criticized on-screen for his actions after the fact by anyone other than himself. In fact, everyone else pats him on the back for doing what he thought was best and making a painfully hard decision.
</li><li> Oddly, the leader of Rossiu's old village was an aversion: since it was a small village they wanted to avoid overpopulation and any time there were more than fifty people there they would draw lots to exile the extra people. However, he isn't needlessly antagonized because of this, and the ending even suggests he was doing the right thing (it helped that he left Gimmy and Darry with Team Gurren instead of just throwing them out).

This being <em>Sailor Moon</em>, the rain stops in time for the girls and Taiki to view the comet, and Taiki concedes that he can see the dreams and romance while viewing the comet.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack">Darker Than Black</a></em>, Contractors are perfectly logical and steered by self-interest rather than emotion, but it's played with. They are logical, for a given value of logical. They base their "logic" entirely off of what benefits themselves (and is most likely to keep them alive longest) the most, and every action they take in some way serves that (although sometimes you have to think about it for a while to see how their actions are self-preservation motivated). However, it is stated that this cruelly rational mindset degrades over time, and most contractors we see have been so for years, given the sociopathy plenty of time to begin to fade. The "new" contractors we <em>do</em> see act exactly as the stereotype claims. Tania from season 2 goes from a giggling, bubbly girl to an emotionless, amoral sociopath overnight. She even breaks up with her boyfriend solely because she doesn't see the need for children (they're fifteen).

<ul><li> Oddly enough, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averted</a> in the comics with regard to Shockwave. Shockwave is a cold, calculating Decepticon warrior who embraces pure logic... but his definition of logic <em>is</em>, in fact correct - "the course of action with the highest possibility of victory." In the old Marvel Transformers comics, he once ceded leadership of the Decepticons to Megatron, convinced that Megatron's logic was superior. In IDW's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersMegaSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersMegaSeries">early comics</a>, the trope is played with when he's confronted with the raw, animal fury of the Dynobots (known in most other continuities as the <em>Dino</em>bots); his usual cold, calculating strategy was unable to stand up against their savage assault, and he decides to think like the enemy... and goes <em>berserk</em> simply to match their brutality pound-for-pound, allowing an emotion to become a factor in his logic. That emotion was <em>rage</em>, and it served Shockwave well, winning him the fight. An unforeseen weapon on the Dynobots' ship incapacitated him by causing a volcanic eruption once he'd switched off his anger program, but note that he gave in to emotion <em>simply because it was logical to leave cold reasoning behind and embrace fury</em>.
</li><li> Prowl plays the trope in a more straight-forward way. He is logical to a fault. This is presented like something good, since he is one of the best Autobot tacticians... and like something bad, since Prowl is downright unable to stand illogical things or let himself deal with their existence. He is capable of staying paralyzed in the heat of a battle as he tries making sense out of whatever has got him perplexed. The Autobot's first bout against the Decepticons in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers">the Marvel comics</a> is a good example of it.

The logical Treens of North Venus had long ago destroyed their beasts of burden which they regarded as useless in a mechanical age.

Then Dan realised that the Earth habit of enjoying things just for their own sake, such as archery, horse riding, canoeing and glider flying meant that Earth had exactly what was needed to break the deadlock. A volley of arrows followed by a thunderous cavalry charge won the decisive battle.

<ul><li> An example that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">may or may not be an aversion</a>: Part of the backstory of the protagonist is that earlier in his life, a robot was faced with a choice of saving him or a young girl. He had a 45% chance of survival, and she had a 11% percent chance of survival, so the robot chose to save him. His complaint is that the <em>wrong kind</em> of logic was applied; he viewed her life as being worth more than his, so, to him, she should have been saved. This became the main reason for the protagonist's hatred of robots. In the commentary, the director said that the robot who saved Smith did the right thing, and that Smith was bothered by that knowledge.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">V.I.K.I.'s motivations</span> are entirely rooted in logical thought. Sonny even comments that he can understand the logic behind the plan perfectly, "but it just seems too... heartless." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">V.I.K.I.</span>'s motivations are logical for her premise, it's her premise/goal that is wrong. She is looking to save lives at all costs, but one could argue there was a much better way to go about the coup that wouldn't set up an us-vs-them mentality that would encourage humans to fight to the death. The problem is that humans want more than just personal survival. We would rather accept small risk if it means enjoyment or a meaning in life, and would be inadvertently encouraged to die for freedom when it's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">And I Must Scream</a> world dictated by robots. If she had started out with the premise of "I must preserve human happiness" instead of "I must preserve human life" things would have been far different. Of course, life, unlike happiness, can be quantified, and even logic based on preserving and maximizing happiness can become something horrific when pushed to its logical conclusions.

This time, however, Spock is captain, and outranks Kirk. Later Kirk shows that Spock is emotionally <em>compromised</em> and takes command. In both instances we are talking about the young Spock from the alternate timeline created by the <em>Narada</em> at the beginning of the film.
</li><li> Both subverted and played out straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVITheUndiscoveredCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVITheUndiscoveredCountry">Star Trek VI</a></em>. At one point Spock answers an appeal to logic from his protege Valeris by saying, "Logic, logic, logic. Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Valeris, not the end." During the remainder of the film, Spock is often telling outright lies or asking crewmembers to do so (acts that certainly go against what Vulcans traditionally consider logical) and describing the lies as "a miscommunication" and other euphemisms...anything but "a lie." But in the end, we find that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">for reasons she considers "logical," Valeris has conspired to assassinate Klingon Chancellor Gorkon and frame Kirk for his murder. When she says she doesn't recall the names of her fellow conspirators, Spock asks, "A lie?" She replies, "A choice."</span>
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</a></em>, where Spock <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">sacrifices himself by exposing himself to lethal doses of radiation</span> to save the Enterprise, and justifies his actions on the basis of logic. While McCoy and Kirk both hate Spock's actions on emotional grounds, Spock's cold logic saves the ship and is held up as one of the most awesome and heroic moments in the entire franchise.
<ul><li> His plan is logical, but is poorly explained. He states "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one". Considering that he was going to die anyway if he *didn't* try his plan, it's absolutely logical for him to do so. Note also that this quote is a basic philosophical tenet of Utilitarianism, and is *not* considered an uncontroversial, absolute truth. Those who follow more Deontological philosophies would heartily disagree.
</li><li> In the same film, Spock argues that Kirk accepting promotion is illogical ("a waste of material") because he makes a better starship captain than an admiral. In most scenarios, choosing to do what one loves over accepting a higher rank is presented as the "emotional" response.

The message isn't so much that you can't win a nuclear war, but that the <em>correct</em> move is not to "play the game" at all. At least that seems to be the Aesop. In any case, WOPPER's "logic" is sound and subverts the notion that one can rationally plan a nuclear war, so this may count as a subversion of the trope.

During the hearing in which Ellie claimed she had a trip through the Stargate and encountered an alien (when all the witnesses and recorded data indicates the Stargate was a complete failure and nothing happened), Occam's Razor is flung back in her face: is it more likely that she hallucinated the journey or that the aliens sent her through the Stargate without leaving a shred of proof? Ellie concedes this but refuses to withdraw her position because her experience was too monumental for humanity's future to dismiss on logic alone. <strong>The kicker:</strong> the Christian philosopher whose personal religious awakening she (politely) dismissed as a psychological phenomenon is the first person to believe her: not because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfJesusThenAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfJesusThenAliens">If Jesus, Then Aliens</a> but because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">they're both committed to the truth</a>.

Supposedly, the mystical and mysterious Force leads him to bet everything on the performance of an unknown boy in a dangerous pod race — a convoluted gambit that only a fellow Jedi can understand.

Lets back up a step. If the skeptics are right about the mist being natural and stay in the store then the weather will blow over in a few hours to a day or someone will come by looking for the grocery store and update them on the situation. They are on their way after a short delay, at most a major inconvenience, or loss of jobs or other personal commitments. If the other groups are right about the mist and there are monsters outside the best bet for survival is not to go outside to be picked off by monsters. The risk analysis of the situation, however low the probability of lethal monsters, would point to staying in the well stocked grocery store and not wandering off. So of course they choose the 'rational choice' after concluding there are no monsters and immediately decide to leave. Norton tells David right before he leaves that if he's wrong the joke will be on him. Poor decision or not, he is at least willing to admit that much. In the novella, David thinks that Norton is, at some level, committing deliberate suicide. It's worth noting other characters also choose to enter the mist early and end up surviving, and are better-off than those who chose to remain.

However, the Duke is being logical by <em>his own</em> system of logic, as he's willing to take a risk of death against a prize of greatly increasing his family fortunes, as opposed to accepting a certainty of exile and mediocrity in return for a guarantee of life. Accepting a risk as counterbalanced against a higher future gain is not automatically illogical — the Duke's error was not in taking the gamble, but in not having accurate knowledge of just how risky a gamble he was taking.
</li><li> Paul's final plan against the Emperor and Space Guild is a hefty subversion of the first example in that it is risky and could have possibly resulted in the stagnation of their civilization; Paul himself calls out the Space Guild in that they chose the safe course and never took a chance at taking control of the spice like he did.

Tiffany Aching, having gone to enormous trouble to get into fairyland to bring her brother home, finds him sitting in a pile of candy, wailing his head off, because he has arrived at the conclusion that he cannot eat any of it based on Buridan's Ass logic: he can grab any piece of candy he wants, and eat it, but if he chooses any one piece to eat, it would mean that he's letting other pieces of candy go uneaten, which is something he cannot bear to do. Justified in that A) he's approximately three, and B) it's implied he's been fed so much candy, the sugar rush has addled his little three-year-old brain already.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>:
<ul><li> Happened more than once in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em>, with Spock.
<ul><li> In "The Galileo Seven", we're shown Spock's first command, as the shuttle he is in charge of crashes on a desolate planet filled with savage aliens. Spock determines that a display of superior force will logically frighten away these aliens while the crew make repairs to the shuttle. Instead, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMcCoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMcCoy">Dr. McCoy</a> points out, the aliens have an emotional reaction and become angry and attack, something Spock did not anticipate. In the end, Spock's desperate act of igniting the fuel from the shuttle to create a beacon proves to be the correct action since it gets the attention of the Enterprise and allows for a rescue. When called on this "emotional" act, Spock replies that the only logical course of action in that instance was one of desperation. The most irritating part of their razzing on him about it was that, even by the narrow definition of "logic" in said episode, that was in fact the most logical choice. The two options were drift and conserve fuel for as long as possible despite a remote chance of being seen and found ultimately and dying anyway, or ignite the fuel source, which might lead to a quicker death from lack of power but would far increase visibility and the chances of being found. The latter of the two choices is smugly called "emotional" despite still being perfectly logical. The part with the aliens doesn't really make sense either. Everyone, including Spock himself, comes down <em>hard</em> on him when his plan doesn't work, but what did he do that was so wrong? He wanted the aliens to leave them alone and hoped to avoid unnecessary bloodshed in the process. The aliens were enraged rather than frightened, and quickly renewed their attack, but no one could have <em>known</em> that would happen. He made a <em>mistake</em>; it happens.
</li><li> Happens straight in the second Pilot. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartPeoplePlayChess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartPeoplePlayChess">Spock and Kirk play 3D chess</a>. Spock is about to win, but Kirk makes an "illogical move" and wins. It'd perhaps be more accurate though to say Kirk used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">Confusion Fu</a> and made an <em>unexpected</em> move.
</li><li> Averted in "Space Seed", where we see fairly clearly from early on the episode that Kirk, Scotty, and (worst of all) Marla McGivers are looking at Khan through various sorts of romanticized shades, reading things into him that were never really there and deceiving themselves about who and what he really is. Spock, on the other hand, clearly recognizes that Khan is, fundamentally, just a mass murderer and a power-hungry egotistical thug who escaped from the catastrophe he helped create and is now potentially dangerous.
</li><li> Averted in "The City On the Edge of Forever" and "Where No Man Has Gone Before". In the first, Spock's cold, clear-eyed logic reveals to him what the choices before Kirk and himself in the time-trip into the 1930s are, and that Kirk's love for Edith Keeler is beside the point of those choices. He is not unsympathetic, as we see in his quiet words: "He knows, Doctor." after Kirk prevents McCoy from saving Edith. In WNMHGB, Spock analyzes the necessary implications of the changes in Kirk's then-best-friend Gary Mitchell, and the trend of where those changes are taking Mitchell, and knows that there is no way out: either Mitchell dies or catastrophe follows, and subsequent events prove him right — Kirk very nearly does wait too long out of sentiment, even after Mitchell <em>himself</em> affirms that Spock is right. In both cases, cold logic is revealing a painful truth that emotion and sentiment can cloud but not change.
</li><li> Subverted in "A Piece of the Action".
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Spock:</strong> It would seem that logic does not apply here. <br/><strong>McCoy:</strong> You admit that? <br/><strong>Spock:</strong> To deny the obvious would be illogical.
</div><ul><li> Averted in "Court Martial", when the ship's computer's records make it appear as though Kirk murdered another officer. Despite not being able to find any evidence of malfunctioning in the computer, Spock steadfastly maintains his confidence in Kirk's innocence, and is ultimately proven right. Spock knows from extensive personal experience that Kirk is a noble man who is consistently able to keep his cool in life-or-death situations; in his view, believing that Kirk killed someone out of panic or spite is as illogical as expecting a hammer not to fall when dropped.
</li><li> Infamously played straight in "The Apple", where Kirk and McCoy try to destroy the machine that keeps the native civilization of the paradise planet alive, in order to show them the value of love and freedom. Spock points out to them that Starfleet officers are not permitted to interfere in the politics of primitive alien civilizations, that they have no way to predict the consequences of such a drastic interference in the evolution of a species they just discovered earlier that day, and that the natives lead long, happy lives under the existing system, even if a human in the same situation might be less content. Kirk retorts that he owes it to the natives to give them the freedom to choose how to live and think for themselves — even though, so far as is shown, the natives' service to the machine is entirely voluntary. The episode doesn't show us the aftermath of Kirk's decision, but when Spock attempts to discuss them in the final scene using an admittedly bizarre argument, Kirk and McCoy just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdHominem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdHominem">mock his physical appearance</a> and ignore everything he says.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarTrekTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarTrekTheAnimatedSeries">Animated Series</a></em> episode "The Magicks of Megas-Tu" neatly subverts or perhaps averts this. In a parallel universe where magic works, McCoy scoffs at Spock's attempt to perform a magical ritual. His reply? "It must work, Doctor. It is <em>logical</em> — here."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">The Next Generation</a></em>:
<ul><li> In early episodes of both <em>The Original Series</em> and <em>The Next Generation</em>, humans who have uploaded their minds into android bodies discover that they have lost some ineffable, illogical, <em>human</em> quality in the transfer. Despairing at this loss, they choose to terminate their existence — a strangely emotional reaction for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinMan">beings which now supposedly have none</a>. Ironically, this is referenced and deconstructed by <em>Data</em>, of all people, in the episode of <em>The Measure of a Man</em>; a scientist wants to disassemble him and dump his memory into a computer so he could study him and learn how to create more like him, and Data refuses, fully believing in that same ineffable quality to memory and believing he, himself would lose it in the transfer, despite <em>himself being an android</em>. In an attempt to explain this, he compares it to how learning how to play poker from a book isn't the same as actually playing the game, in person, implying that the "ineffable quality" being lost is the personal importance and significance of those experiences, the context which makes the event special for that individual, which — when read out of that context as a mere descriptive text readout — cannot be fully understood or appreciated — an actually logical argument when you think about it.
</li><li> This is also the episode in which Data claims to have "read and absorbed every treatise and textbook on the subject" of poker, but was completely surprised by the existence of bluffing. What kind of poker textbook doesn't discuss bluffing?
</li><li> Troi beats Data at chess. She then explains to him that chess isn't just a game of logic, but also intuition. As the Nitpicker's Guide puts it, "Try playing 'intuitive' chess against a computer and you'll lose in no time flat" (and then suggests that perhaps she had his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultyLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultyLevel">Difficulty Level</a> set to "below novice"). Shown for laughs in <a class="urllink" href="http://xkcd.com/232/">xkcd 232<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Great chess masters can play via intuition (and indeed, when playing speed chess, it's a necessity), however, intuition when playing a game such as chess is merely the player's experience in playing the game allowing them to make strong plays without thinking too much. Ultimately, that intuition comes FROM logic, as the player has enough experience to recognize generally favorable moves and positions on sight. The Troi example is particularly egregious because she really just reverses the correct terms. Her move was unintuitive, but was entirely logical because it immediately led to victory.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Deep Space Nine</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one episode, Sarkona, a Vulcan, joins the Maquis because she agrees with their position and believes their rather crude and barbaric actions to achieve "peace" to be logical... but she's called out by <em>Quark</em>, locked in the brig with her after her plans are exposed, noting that, as the Federation had caught the Cardassians (the Maquis' enemies) supplying their people with weapons to fight against the Maquis, sitting down with them and hammering out an arrangement would bring the peace better and "at a bargain price" compared to continuing the fight.
</li><li> In another episode, Captain Solok has been hassling Benjamin Sisko across the known galaxy for the past two decades, all in the name of proving that emotional, illogical humans (like Sisko) are inferior to emotionless, logical Vulcans (like himself). Somewhat subverted by the end of the episode, when the Deep Space Nine crew successfully goad Solok into losing his temper, and it's generally implied that Solok is by no means representative of Vulcans, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">is really just kind of a jerk.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Tuvok on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Voyager</a></em> often acted as a Straw Vulcan.
<ul><li> Played with in this dialogue (when captured):
<div class="indent"><strong>Tuvok:</strong> Resistance is illogical. <br/><strong>Seven:</strong> Logic is irrelevant.
</div></li><li> At least the writers seemed to acknowledge that Tuvok was a tightass even by Vulcan standards. From the episode "Flashback":
<div class="indent"><strong>Sulu:</strong> Mr. Tuvok, if you're going to remain on my ship, you're going to have learn how to appreciate a joke. And don't tell me Vulcans don't have a sense of humor, because I know better.
</div></li><li> The above (obviously a reference to Spock) might also be a specific nod to a scene in the original series episode "The Corbomite Maneuver", which Sulu himself witnessed (and was quite amused by):
<div class="indent"><strong>Bailey:</strong> Raising my voice back there doesn't mean I was scared or couldn't do my job. It means I happen to have a human thing called an adrenaline gland.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Spock:</strong> It does sound most inconvenient, however. Have you considered having it removed? <em>(Spock leaves.)</em>
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Bailey:</strong> <em>(to Sulu, who is grinning)</em> Very funny.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Sulu:</strong> You try to cross brains with Spock, he'll cut you to pieces every time.
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">Played with</a> when Janeway replicates a cupcake for Tuvok on his birthday, complete with a single birthday candle. He initially refuses to play along with such a silly ritual, but when Janeway turns her back, he blows out the candle. He replies that it was a fire hazard, but it's implied that he did it to make Janeway happy, which is a perfectly logical decision, since while he saw no point in the ritual, he knew it would please his friend and captain, and so did it anyway.
</li><li> Tuvok had occasionally had the opportunity to avert this, as in one episode where a seemingly unstoppable energy field is slowly enveloping the ship, and after all their attempts to prevent it fail, he suggests simply waiting for it to consume them and seeing what happens. The rest of the crew objects, but he counters that they don't actually know what the energy field is, and given that all their other options have been exhausted, inaction is the only logical choice left to make, even if the odds of survival are low.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em>:
<ul><li> Over the course of four years T'Pol undergoes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> that brings up traumatic memories of losing her emotional control in a jazz nightclub, remembers repressed memories of a line-of-duty killing (that also led to a loss of emotional control), suffers from Pa'nar Syndrome that degrades her neural pathways (leading to a loss of emotional control), becomes addicted to Trellium-D (which causes a loss of emotional control), and is infected by a microbe that makes her undergo a premature <em>pon farr</em> (leading to a loss of emotional control and clothing). It seems that the writers believed that the only way T'Pol's character could develop was to take away the characteristics that made her different from humans.
</li><li> While T'Pol is probably the queen of all Straw Vulcans, she's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanHasAPoint">often proven completely right</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot">all of the wrong reasons</a>. For example, in an early episode, the crew discovers an uncharted Earth-like planet. T'Pol mentions that standard Vulcan protocol for such an event is to scan the planet from orbit for a week before sending people down in person. Archer basically ignores her, because he wants to go down and explore in person, and immediately sends a team down that isn't equipped with any kind of protective suits. The entire conflict of the episode (which almost results in deaths) comes from the fact that the air contains hallucinogens, which is something that would have been discovered if they spent time scanning the planet first.
</li><li> That said, in the episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekEnterpriseS01E17Fusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekEnterpriseS01E17Fusion">Fusion</a>" the crew met an offshoot culture of Vulcans who ate meat and believed that emotion in moderation was not harmful in the slightest; as long as you had control over your emotions, there was no reason you couldn't allow yourself to feel and express that emotion. They were sort of an exploration of what would happen if you had Vulcans who weren't straw.
</li><li> One of the plans for the fifth season (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">had there been one</a>), was to reveal that T'Pol's father was a Romulan spy, which would go a long way towards explaining her Straw Vulcan tendencies in the earlier seasons.

<ul><li> Michael Burnham's insistence that her viewpoint is logical (she was raised by Vulcans despite being human), when in reality she tends to badly misread situations, results in her becoming one of these on many occasions, and a large part of her arc in the first season revolves around her trying to overcome this tendency. For example, she insisted in the pilot episodes "The Vulcan Hello/Battle at the Binary Stars" that the only logical opening communication to the Klingons was a show of force instead of the standard Starfleet "we come in peace" line. Whether it would have worked or not is up for debate, but the way she tried to enforce that view (try to convince Captain Georgiou, then nerve-pinch her into unconsciousness when that failed and try to convince the rest of the crew before she woke up) backfired dramatically, resulting in a Federation/Klingon war and Michael being court-martialed and sent to prison.
</li></ul></li><li> Although widely used and occasionally subverted or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in <em>Star Trek,</em> as noted in the many examples above, the trope is notably averted in the <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> episode <em>Redemption, Part II</em>. In an operation involving a large number of ships and not enough captains to go around, a number of senior officers, including Data, are given command of various ships. Data's first officer repeatedly questions Data's orders and the fitness of an android to command a ship, until Data (seemingly) angrily tells him, "Mr. Hobson! You will carry out my orders or I will relieve you of duty!" Data correctly realizes that the emotional response <em>is</em> the logical one, necessary in order to motivate Hobson.

<ul><li> The series takes delight in simultaneously subverting and playing this trope straight whenever a protagonist's crazy plan <em>works</em> despite the logical objections of others, but also leads to lasting consequences which <em>always</em> come back to bite them in the arse. Characters will continually point out this trend, but usually concede to the fact that they're screwed either way and really don't have a choice.
</li><li> Played painfully straight in the episode "My Three Crichtons," in which the three Crichtons in question are the original, a primitive caveman-like creature, and an advanced version with a brain so big it has distended his skull. The advanced Crichton is explicitly stated at several points to run on pure logic, which in practice means that he's a gigantic, backstabbing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> "The Ice Warriors" features a completely logical computer that the scientists are dependent on, that is completely useless once the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem">Outside-Context Problem</a> shows up as there is no perfect solution and it has not been programmed to anticipate this sort of thing. Everyone else in the setting is completely aware that the computer is useless, except for, unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss">the person actually in charge</a> who remains slavishly devoted to it.
</li><li> "Destiny of the Daleks", has the Daleks and Movellans, two "perfectly logical" races, at war in a perpetual stalemate because neither of them, each knowing the other will anticipate and compensate for their logical strategies, can find the best time to attack. This is possible if there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a>-type mutually assured destruction, but it's written as Straw Vulcan "logic", including the "logical" computers not accepting short term losses (losing some soldiers) and not accepting other than a guaranteed success. The groups want Davros and the Doctor respectively to use illogic to help them win, and Davros eventually orders some Daleks to sacrifice themselves to destroy the Movellan ship. The story ends with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> about making mistakes leading to winning. This one is especially weird because the Daleks are shown elsewhere to be anything but a "perfectly logical" race, being very emotional indeed (albeit the usual emotion being <em>hate</em>). And they don't even have the excuse, such as it is, of falling into research failure; this story was written by Terry Nation, the Daleks' creator and the writer of over half the other Dalek stories to this point. For that matter, script editor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams">Douglas Adams</a> is usually very good about avoiding this trope too.
</li><li> The later episode, <em>Evolution of the Daleks</em>, works the logic/emotion debate more realistically, as Sec's newly acquired ability to feel emotions other than hate makes him far more "logical". This is a genuine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> (considering <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a></span>), but there was pragmatism here, as the recurring flaw of the Daleks, especially in the post-time-war era, is their tendency to let genocidal xenophobia trump their logic. Sec reasoned, quite logically, that the best way to ensure the survival of your race was not to carry the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall">Villain Ball</a> everywhere. The prime turning point being that as Sec starts to let go of said genocidal xenophobia, he's able to ask the other Daleks the obvious question "If we're so superior, why are we the last survivors?" while turning to humanity and recognizing that for all their short comings, they always survive and continue.
</li><li> The Cybermen in particular suffer from this trope:
<ul><li> They've removed all of their emotions and are supposed to function completely by logic, as according to them, emotion is weakness; the fact that they don't have any emotions often completely scuttles them, because their logic is thus totally flawed.
</li><li> It's subverted, however, in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> comic strip, in which an army of invading Cybermen are confronted by a military leader who tells them that, for all their claims of logical superiority, the emotional strength of the humans they are facing will defeat them. The Cyberleader's response is to douse everyone present with a hallucinogenic agent that sends all of the humans into complete emotional breakdown. Completely crushed and driven half-insane, the humans present <em>beg</em> to be converted into Cybermen; against such a weapon, emotion really <em>is</em> a weakness.
</li><li> In most of their '80's appearances, it was heavily implied that they hadn't been entirely successful with the removal of emotion. While this was never used to its full extent, it was recurring enough to not just feel like bad writing, and some of their defeats can, partially, be attributed to emotional Cyber Leaders. Excellent, indeed. In <em>Earthshock</em> in particular, the Cyber Leader takes a curiously gloating pleasure in Tegan's pain at the possibility of her planet's entire destruction for a supposedly 'emotionless' being.
</li></ul></li><li> The effect of this trope on the viewer was made visible with the "new" Cybermen in "Doomsday": when the Cybermen propose an alliance with the Daleks, they claim to bring "elegance" of design to the table, and manage a subtle dig about the lack of it in the Dalek physical form. As noted above, logic is about how to <em>achieve</em> goals, not about what those goals are, so there's nothing illogical about the Cybermen prizing "elegance", as they pursue it in a logical fashion. This did not stop a number of fans from shouting "That's not <em>logical</em>!" about the exchange. In fact, "Elegance is good. Cybermen are elegant. Therefore, making more Cybermen makes more elegance, and, by extension, more goodness" is actually a <em>far more logical</em> motive for their actions than the traditional Cyberman strategy of "Survival is good. Therefore let's send <em>our entire race</em> off on incredibly risky invasions of Earth following pretty much the same strategy that has failed and led us to near extinction several times already" used repeatedly through the classic series. Just after the Cybermen have boasted of elegance, we see the procedure they go through to fire their built-in weapons. The Dalek's simple point-and-exterminate is far more elegant — and effective.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series lives on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddCouple">Odd Couple</a> relationship between emotional and intuitive Booth and logical and rational Brennan: she's frequently shown as being wrong in the end, or being right for the wrong reasons. It gets really jarring when you consider that Bones is very rarely rational or logical at all. In one episode, Angela pointed out that one of Brennan's skills is not being rational, but <em>rationalizing</em> her actions.
</li><li> When Brennan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia">lost her memory of the last couple days</a> and was framed for murder; she argued <em>in favor her own guilt</em> as the most logical conclusion even though the police had no motive whatsoever and Booth pointed out she was not capable of murder.
</li><li> This is even more noticeable in the last two seasons where Bones did THE EXACT SAME THING her father did to her FOR THE EXACT SAME REASON then comes back and acts like shes done nothing wrong, to the point of wondering why Booth is so upset. Whats more jarring is that before this happened there was yet another episode dedicated to her abandonment issues with her father.
</li><li> Perhaps the best evidence of this is when she first met Jared; everybody tried to get her to realize that he was bad news. Her response was that they had no evidence, but at the same time she believed a virtual stranger when he told him that Booth was a loser despite knowing him for years

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>: the hyper-logical Asgard, on the verge of defeat in their war against the Replicators, come to Earth seeking ideas from a more primitive, more savage race. Immediately averted by Jack saying "You're actually saying you need someone dumber than you are?" Carter, as it turns out, is indeed dumb enough to win that battle. The fact that the Asgard, practically alone among <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Sufficiently Advanced Aliens</a>, are able to acknowledge they are not perfect and, more importantly, humanity and Earth in particular actually have something to contribute is one reason they are such great guys. Of course, the Asgard's main reason for coming is that they are so advanced they have trouble coming up with low-tech solutions (for example, launching pieces of metal at a high speed using a small explosive to deal with targets that have shielding against energy weapons) or solutions to problem their technology can't solve. Which makes sense, as similar things happen IRL. People living in the 21st century would often not think (or even be aware) of several tricks and trades used centuries prior - and not think of using such tricks when they might again be useful (see the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> section of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser">Rock Beats Laser</a> for example). The Asgard's previous tactic of throwing more-and-more advanced technological weapons and spaceships against the Replicators was disastrous in particular because the Replicators would assimilate their tech and grow more powerful each time.

Smart Guy, quite sensibly, points out that that would mean a chance of trying some of them twice, thus wasting precious seconds.
</li><li> Played straight in the first meeting with the Genii. While infiltrating a Wraith Hiveship, Teyla discovers some human prisoners. She becomes emotionally moved and stays behind (with one of the Genii) to free them... except that the success of the mission crucially depends on the Wraith not realizing that it ever took place. After pointing this out to Teyla and being subsequently ignored, the Genii, as the Straw Vulcan of the day, "logically" shoots down the prisoner with his <em>unsilenced</em> firearm. This, of course, instantly alerts the Wraith; the Genii is shot and paralyzed just after, and Teyla leaves him to die, despite the fact that he's an old friend of hers and the show typically operates on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneGetsLeftBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneGetsLeftBehind">No One Gets Left Behind</a> premise. But hey, that's the price you pay for being logical and trying to avoid the deaths of many of your people.
</li><li> It's hard to say whether the Genii are meant to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkasses</a> or Jerkass Straw Vulcans. While they may be said to be overly pragmatic (they do believe in the importance of the Genii people and society over individuals, to rather harsh, but somewhat justified means and ends), they aren't paragons of wisdom, nor are ever said to be logical.
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheColbertReport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheColbertReport">The Colbert Report</a>,</em> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenColbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenColbert">Stephen Colbert</a>'s character often sets up the "liberal elite" as a Straw Vulcan. We aren't supposed to agree with Colbert's character; the character himself is the real Stephen's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter">Strawman Political</a>. The fallacy of using a straw vulcan highlights both his own lack of logic and the brilliance of the supposed straw vulcan, which means that by lampshading it, he's both averted <em>and</em> inverted the trope.
</li><li> Nick Stokes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em> can make his co-workers look like Straw Vulcans as he is generally more concerned than his co-workers with establishing rapport with the victim's family and keeping the human dynamics of a case in mind. He's not a better CSI per se because of this but he's more suited to the parts of the job the police academy doesn't train you for; giving reassurance to the victim's family and reaching out to reluctant witnesses.
</li><li> The Professor from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilligansIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilligansIsland">Gilligan's Island</a></em> although it's more "imagination is better than logic." Honestly, after all the stuff that goes on on that island you'd think the Professor would EVENTUALLY realize that science isn't going to work there. Then again, you would think he would come to the logical conclusion to keep Gilligan far away from any experiment or device he is building. By force, if necessary.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em> featured a logistics expert who was treated as little more than a cold and calculating monster because he projected casualties before a battle in order to make preparations for receiving them. By the end of the episode, of course, Hawkeye had taught him the "error" of his ways. Also overlaps, as these things often do, with Strawman Has A Point.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ModernFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ModernFamily">Modern Family</a></em> episode "Lifetime Supply", Jay and Manny go the horse track with Manny's father, Javier (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Benjamin Bratt</a>). Jay chooses his horses based on the information in the <em>Daily Racing Form</em>. Javier bets on a horse because "I looked him in the eyes, and he told me this would be his day". Guess who wins? To add insult to injury, Jay chooses a horse this way and <em>it</em> wins ... only to be disqualified.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhiteChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhiteChristmas">White Christmas</a>: Choi Chi Hun is the detached genius who admits to having trouble understanding emotions and empathy. However, the trope is consistently averted as he remains the smartest and most rational of the students. When the mysterious letters have the characters almost come to blows, Chi Hun figures out the sender sits him down and they have a private civil chat about why the sender did it. When they're held hostage, he calmly takes the situation in and tries collaborating with the others to find a way out. When he get's into a conflict with the more emotional character Park Moo Yul because Moo Yul gave the killer's unloaded gun to his girlfriend, Chi Hun is portrayed in the right, as Mo Yul has endangered all of them by leaving the gun and the ammunition in the same location where some one can turn them into a threat. Kang Mi Reu, one of the most emotional characters, was the one who took the bullets out in the first place so something like that wouldn't happen. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This of course allows the killer and his accomplice to regain control of the school</span>.

</li><li> Played truly bizarrely in one route of <em>Zero Escape <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/VirtuesLastReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/VirtuesLastReward">Virtue's Last Reward</a></em>, where Phi, in discussing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonersDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonersDilemma">Prisoner's Dilemma</a> and Ambidex Game, continually refers to "Betray" as the "logical" and "rational" decision... despite going in depth on how it's sub-optimal for both the group and the individual, meaning that it's <em>illogical</em> and <em>irrational</em> by real-world rather than Straw Vulcan definitions of logic, unless for some reason you were applying logic with the goal of "Make the least advantageous decision."
<ul><li> If you don't know what decision the other player will make, it <em>is</em> the most logical choice. If they chose to ally, then you're better off if you betray than if you ally. If they choose to betray, then you're still better off if you betray than if you ally (at least in the standard version—there's supposed to be a motivation to betray if you know your opponent will do the same, forming a Nash equilibrium at betray/betray).
</li></ul></li><li> Morrigan from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> has this role in your party. The most striking example being her objection to help out with the situation in Redcliffe, because it presents a huge delay in your quest to stop the Darkspawn, despite the fact that helping them would get the Grey Wardens some crucial allies for their fight against the Darkspawn. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It turns out later that she was deliberately conditioned to not want to help people while growing up, and her arguments are rationalizations.</span>
</li><li> Racter from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowrunReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowrunReturns">Shadowrun: Hong Kong</a></em> firmly believes that humanity can only reach <em>true</em> transcendence via complete cyberization. This is in the face of the fact that cybernetics in the Shadowrun universe are known to literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberneticsEatYourSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberneticsEatYourSoul">eat your soul</a> and have in the past turned people who put a bit too many cybernetics into themselves into crazed, emotionless psychopaths, but Racter actually believes that emotions are what is <em>holding humanity back</em> from transcendence anyways. Racter himself is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTheManHeUsedToBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTheManHeUsedToBe">half</a> cybernetic, but he doesn't experience the side effects (or so he says) because he was <em>already diagnosed with sociopathy</em> as a young child. Thus, his belief is that the <em>one</em> thing that prevents humanity from reaching its true potential is its capacity for emotions.

<ul><li> Sokka of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> is often put in this position when the Gaang is trying to help people. However, it's subverted in "The Fortuneteller", where they have to convince the people that the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">volcano will erupt</span>. Although a lot of times Sokka will act on instinct and emotion, oftentimes, he is actually very practical and logical in the non-straw sense. Over the course of the series though, he grows out of it. By the time of <em>Legend Of Korra,</em> when Sokka is a judge, his response to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a crime-boss being accused of blood-bending without a full moon,</span> is more or less, "Yes, it's supposed to be impossible, but I've seen a lot of weird, seemingly-impossible crap in my life, and a <em>lot</em> of victims have come forth, so let's discuss it."
</li><li> Squidward of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants">Spongebob Squarepants</a></em> is frequently put as a Straw Vulcan counterpart to Spongebob and Patrick. Sometimes he's perfectly logical and the universe screws him over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">just 'cos.</a>
</li><li> Averted in, of all places, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheReplacements" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheReplacements">The Replacements</a></em>. One episode revolves around the problems of Riley displaying some "Straw Vulcan" behavior.... however, it's never labeled as "logical", and in the end, it's determined that it's not innately inferior to more impulsive behavior... but just that each is better-suited to certain problems and situations.
</li><li> Albert in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TwasTheNightBeforeChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TwasTheNightBeforeChristmas">'Twas the Night Before Christmas</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">genius</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MouseWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MouseWorld">mouse</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpock">kid</a> who repeatedly expresses disbelief in Santa, and refuses to think with his heart. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitrarySkepticism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitrarySkepticism">Even when Santa is literally real, with an actual postal address on the South Pole and everything</a>.

The calamity of the story happens because he decides to send a letter to Santa where he says he isn't real and he stupidly signs it "all of us" — meaning Santa believes that <em>all of the people in town</em> told him to get lost and <em>nearly</em> decides not to give them presents.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticScience">research magician</a> Twilight Sparkle disregards repeated observational evidence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Pinkie Pie's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderSense">"Pinkie Sense"</a> because it's not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAnalyzedMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAnalyzedMagic">Sufficiently Analyzed Magic</a>. Then, under the influence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries">severe repeated head trauma</a> and possible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurningWithAnger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurningWithAnger">stress-induced brain aneurysm</a>, she concludes that it "just makes sense," and that you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsWrong">"just have to choose to believe"</a> in things you don't understand. After the inevitable backlash, the creator of the show, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenFaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenFaust">Lauren Faust</a>, apologized, saying that that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalAesop">wasn't meant to be</a> the moral to take away from the episode.
</li><li> The original Prowl from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em> was described as being logical to the point of shutting down when faced with an unexpectedly crazy situation. In the cartoon, this wasn't really touched on and he was portrayed more as a just-the-facts-ma'am style military policeman.
