She urges Rygel to return to Hyneria to lay claim to his rightful throne, telling him that the people will support his claim. However, this turns out to be a trap. Bishan captures Rygel and imprisons him along with several of Rygel's supporters.

Several of the claimants to the Iron Throne see <em>themselves</em> as this (Stannis is the rightful heir of the former King Robert who claimed his throne by conquest; Viserys and Daenerys are the children of the king before Robert, Aerys II Targaryen, and the scions of a royal line that had ruled the realm for centuries; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aegon is Aerys' grandson, thought to have been killed as a baby; although <em>this</em> Aegon may well be an imposter descended from a long-established, exiled, cadet branch of Targaryens, the Blackfyres, who claim decent from Daemon Blackfyre, who they say was the only true heir of King Aegon IV from about eight or nine decades back</span>). The modern Targaryens are thoroughly swept up by this trope, believing their return to the throne will inevitably unite their people and restore peace to the realm. However, it's frequently shown throughout the series that there's not necessarily any correlation between right to rule, ability to rule, ability to win a civil war, or public reputation. Exemplified by Viserys Targaryen. While the last son of King Aerys and claiming he is the rightful King, he is a massive jerk who abuses his sister, sells her as a wife to Khal Drogo, and arrogantly treats everybody as below him. Finally, he threatens to take Daenerys back and cut their child out, at which Drogo promises him a crown of gold <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and pours molten gold over their head.</span>
</li><li> Done on a lower level with rule of the North. After Lord Roose Bolton betrays and murders Robb Stark, the King in the North, he is granted control of the North. It is believed Eddard Stark's two younger sons Bran and Rickon Stark were killed by Theon Greyjoy, however they are still in hiding and the Boltons want to eliminate them.
</li><li> In-universe, the ruling class is more than aware of the power this trope in the minds of the people. A conquering House is always very careful to either eliminate the conquered House's bloodline or marry off their heir-apparent to the conquered House's (possibly killing off a few potential heirs before arriving at a cooperative one of suitable age and sex) so that their heir will be seen as the rightful ruler. Part of the reason why Blackfish is disinclined to trust Jaime Lannister's offer of clemency in their negotiations to end the siege of Riverrun is that it includes allowing Edmure Tully (rightful lord of Riverrun) to live, something most in his position would consider a dangerous tactical error.

However, the knowledge of his heritage is eventually known to seven people including Daenerys and three of these people want Jon to be the king.

<ul><li> <em>SÃ©arlas Ã“g</em>- The predecessor of the much better known <em>Ã“rÃ³, sÃ© do bheatha 'bhaile</em>, the song (rather prematurely) welcomes the Stuart prince Charles to Ireland, along with his French and Spanish allies, desperately awaiting the time when Charles and his men can come and banish the foreigners and the heretics from Ireland. Some other versions of the original song lament the fact that he <em>couldn't</em> actually get the French support he needed, which is more or less what happened in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>.

</li><li> <em>Wha'll Be King But Charlie?</em>- This Scottish song celebrates the return of Prince Charlie to Scotland, which happened in 1745, and declares the loyalty of all Scotland to their rightful Prince.
</li><li> <em>Charlie is My Darlin'</em>- Another song commemorating Prince Charlie's return during The '45.
</li><li> <em>Will Ye No Come Back Again?</em>- After the '45 Rebellion failed, Prince Charles fled Scotland and went back to France; this song laments that the Stuarts are leaving <em>yet again</em>, and wonders if they will <em>ever</em> return another time (they didn't).
</li><li> <em>When the King Enjoys His Own Again</em>- Actually written after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar">English Civil War</a>, when England was ruled by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplesRepublicOfTyranny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplesRepublicOfTyranny">military junta</a> under the control of Oliver Cromwell, this song was resurrected as a Jacobite tune after 1688. "Yes, this I can tell", it goes, "That all will be well, when the King enjoys his own again".
</li><li> <em>Skye Boat Song</em>- Commemorating Prince Charles' escape by boat after the failure of The '45, the last line promises "Charlie will come again".
</li><li> <em>There'll Never Be Peace Till Jamie Comes Hame</em>- Commemorates the failure of The '15 and the flight of the eponymous James III, "the Old Pretender".

This all took place some thirty years before the events of the game. At the time of the game, Gaspard is waging civil war against Celene in one last attempt to reclaim what he views as his rightful crown, and should he succeed (based on the player's decisions), his supporters view his coronation as this trope.

In "The True Blade", the kingdom of Erathia was destroyed along with the rest of Enroth during the Reckoning. Many of the survivors who ended up on Axeoth were led by the Erathian knight Sir Lysander who formed a small kingdom for them, Palaedra. He refused to officially become king himself, believing that only a true Gryphonheart could rule Erathia's people even if Erathia itself is no more. Along comes Sir Worton who bears and draws the supposed Gryphonheart sword which only a true Gryphonheart can wield. Lysander is suspicious and soon discovers that Worton is a pretender and his blade is a mere forgery. In the final scenario of the campaign, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lysander ends up drawing the true blade himself, and thus discovers that he is a Gryphonheart.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">Â Â Â Â Real LifeÂ </div><div class="folder" id="folder16" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> examples: Charles II (Britain and Ireland), Louis XVIII (France), and Juan Carlos (Spain).
<ul><li> Juan Carlos is an especially modern one. Son of the King in exile, he was taken by Franco and made his Heir since he was the rightful King. Juan Carlos made pleasing sounds, and once Franco was dead, he arranged for a new constitution, ended the authoritarian state, turned Spain into a modern democracy, crushed a coup trying to force it back into a dictatorship, and pretty much gave up all his power under the constitution. By the end, even the <em>Communist</em> Party leader was crowing, "God Save the King!"
</li></ul></li><li> A while back, it turns out that one of the Kings of England may have been illegitimately born, which if true would, technically, make pretty much the entire current royal family illegitimate. They tracked down the direct descendants of the legitimate heir... a Scottish lord living an ordinary life in Australia, who does not even use his legal title (14th Earl of Loudoun) in public - and thinks Australia should be a republic!
<ul><li> The Edward IV legitimacy question crops up a lot, but it's ultimately not material to who sits on the throne today. Parliament decides the succession, and the current royal family has been explicitly asked to take the throne on two separate occasions (the restoration of Charles II in 1660, and the Glorious Revolution in 1688).
<ul><li> Doubly immaterial because the Act of Settlement 1701 provided that, should William III and his sister-in-law Anne both die without issue (which they did), the throne would pass to the Elector Sophia of Hanover or her (Protestant) descendants, effectively "resetting" the royal line. (Sophia died before Anne did, so the claim passed to her son, George I.)
</li><li> Triply immaterial since the current royal family descends from the Tudors, and they owe their claim to the throne to being the last descendants of the House of Lancaster (Edward IV was from the House of York, which they defeated)and to the fact that Henry Tudor defeated the Yorks, earning the crown by right of conquest.
</li><li> Indeed, the supposed "true monarch" may not be the true heir by strict male-preference primogeniture and the fact that the program that claims him as such was made by a network that supposedly has strong British republican affiliations is suspect.
</li></ul></li><li> Of course, such claims crop up all the time â€” a historian recently claimed Queen Victoria was illegitimate, which if true would pass the throne to a minor member of the Danish royal family.
<ul><li> Hell, there are claims <em>now</em> â€” some speculate that Prince Harry is not Prince Charles's son; this would mean that after Charles and his elder son William, the next heir would be Charles's brother Andrew, the Duke of York. That claim is now irrelevant as of July 2013, since Prince William's son George is now third in line to the throne, with the later-born Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis pushing Harry even further back to sixth.
</li><li> And, of course, there's still the Jacobite claim, the current heir being Franz, Duke of Bavaria, or "Francis II", who also happens to be the claimant to the abolished Kingdom of Bavaria. He himself declines to pursue it, though, and the only remaining advocacy groups are essentially aristocratic clubs with a quirky title.
</li></ul></li><li> Also, England tends to be looser about illegitimacy when it suits them â€” William the Conqueror was known as William the Bastard until 1066 for an obvious reason (his mother was a common tanner's daughter who never married William's father Robert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagnificent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagnificent">The Magnificent</a>), and Henry VII had inherited his claim to the throne from an illegitimate son of John of Gaunt, the father of Henry IV.
</li><li> This was seen as the Rightful Queen Returns by many when Mary I, the eldest surviving child of Henry VIII, claimed the throne after the death of her half-brother Edward VI. Edward had been persuaded on his deathbed to disinherit both of his elder half-sisters in favor of his cousin, Jane Grey, who was queen for all of nine days. Mary's supporters deposed Jane and restored Mary to the throne, although when she later became "Bloody Mary" there were those who regretted the plan. Mary herself, unable to bear children, very reluctantly named her half-sister Elizabeth as her successor; those who favored Elizabeth over Mary then considered this trope in effect once again.
</li></ul></li><li> Happened a number of times in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>: King Haakon VII of Norway, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, and Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg were forced to flee to the court of King George VI in London when the Nazis overran their nations (Wilhelmina later relocated to Canada temporarily). They became major symbols of resistance for the occupied nations and returned home in 1945 on the heels of the Allied armies.
</li><li> Similarly happened at the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, when the royalty of most of the occupied nations (including Belgium, Serbia, and Romania) returned to their capitals.
<ul><li> While King Albert I of Belgium was forced to flee his capital when Brussels was overrun, he never fled his country and instead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething">personally led the Belgian Army in the trenches</a>.
</li><li> King Ferdinand I of Romania had fled to the north of the country by 1917 but did not leave Romanian territory. He understood how the resistance to the Central Powers might have collapsed if he appeared to have fled the country.
</li><li> Averted in the case of Luxembourg, where the Grand Duchess did not leave the country and her attempts to make German occupation as bearable to the population as was feasible (she e. g. prevented the execution of resistants) was interpreted as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuisling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuisling">collaboration with the Germans</a>, especially by anti-monarchists, which led to fears that Luxembourg would be annexed by France or Belgium after the country was occupied by the Allied armies in 1918. Eventually Grand Duchess Maria-Adelheid was forced to abdicate in 1919 after two abortive left-wing revolution attempts.
</li><li> Averted but attempted in the case of Montenegro (where the Serbian crown forced a union of the South Slavic states under the rule of Belgrade in the face of armed Montenegrin resistance), and Russia (where the Whites tried to resurrect the monarchy but were defeated by the Bolsheviks).
</li><li> Averted with Charles of Austria-Hungary. With the threat posed by the Allies and the Little Entente, along with Horthy, the aim of reclaiming Hungary was doomed to fail.
</li></ul></li><li> Attempted a number of times by the Jacobites, the followers of the displaced Stuart heirs of James VII/II of Scotland and England, in the 18th century, but it wasn't to be, despite French support.
</li><li> Played mostly straight with Constantine I of Greece, whom the Allies forced to abdicate in favour of his second son Alexander and go into exile in 1917 in order to put an end to Greek neutrality. After Alexander's unexpected death and the electoral defeat of Constantine's political nemesis Venizelos, a plebiscite allowed Constantine I to return to the Greek throne in 1920. However, after the Greek army was defeated in the war against the new Turkish republic he was forced once again to abdicate in favour of his eldest son George II in a coup by pro-Venizelos officers in September 1922. Constantine died in exile in Palermo in January 1923.
<ul><li> George II then had to leave Greece as well (in December 1923) and the Greek National Assembly declared Greece a republic in 1924. When that was dismantled, conservative leader Ionannis Metaxas saw to it that George was returned to the throne in a farcical referendum (98 per cent of votes in favour of the restoration of the monarchy) in 1935, which enabled Metaxas to be established as Greece's dictator in 1936. Forced to go into exile by the German invasion of 1941, George II was reinstated by the British against the wishes of a large part of the Greek population, which led to the Greek civil war (1946-1949). After a referendum in September 1946 George II returned from exile.
</li><li> Averted, so far, with Constantine II of Greece. Subsequent to the military coup of 1967, he went into exile later that year after his counter-coup failed. After the fall of the colonels' rÃ©gime, a 1974 referendum declared Greece a republic with a 70 per cent majority. Constantine never abdicated the throne and in Greece, there still is a small group of monarchists who want him to return to the throne.
</li></ul></li><li> Maharajah <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Marthanda Varma</a> (1706-1758) of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India">Travancore (in the modern Indian state of Kerala)</a> was forced into exile as the result of a coup by his cousins, who wanted the throne, and their allies the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Lords Of The Eight Houses</a>" - the nobles of the state, who disliked his popularity with the people.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GroverCleveland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GroverCleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>. Fun fact - the United States has had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">45 Presidents, but only 44 people have ever actually BEEN President</a>. How did this happen? Because Grover Cleveland was elected the 22nd President in 1884, lost in 1888 to Benjamin Harrison, and was elected again as the 24th President in 1892.
<ul><li> Similarly done twice in Canada: John A. MacDonald served as Prime Minister from 1867 to 1873 and returned to power in 1878, dying in office in 1891. Pierre Trudeau was Prime Minister from 1968 to 1979, returning a year later after Joe Clark's minority government collapsed.
<ul><li> It used to happen quite often in parliamentary-style governments: consider the Earl of Derby, who was prime minister of Great Britain on <em>three</em> non-consecutive occasions in the 19th century. The most recent example would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HaroldWilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HaroldWilson">Harold Wilson</a> in the 1960s and 1970s. (Nowadays, a prime minister who loses an election is expected to resign as leader of his party, and will never get another shot at the top job.)
</li><li> Actually done four times. Arthur Meighen was Prime Minister from 1920-1921, returning for a few months in 1926 during the King-Byng Crisis. Mackenzie King was Prime Minister from 1921- June 1926, returning to power in September. He lost the 1930 election, coming back for a third and final time in 1935 (this time he stayed on until his retirement in 1948).
</li></ul></li><li> Of course for passionate members and followers of a political party the situation when their party loses power and later returns to power, even if both happen by free elections, is often imbued with this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> The years 1814 and 1815 in France saw no less than <em>three</em> such returns. First Louis XVIII returned, with historical legitimacy on his side (he was Louis XVI's brother, after all). Then Napoleon, using support from the people and the army, ousted the Bourbons and reclaimed the throne for a hundred days. Then he had to abdicate again after his crushing defeat at Waterloo, prompting Louis XVIII to return a second time.
</li><li> Deliberately invoked by Napoleon's nephew, Louis Napoleon, who, despite being of no recognised royal bloodline, capitalised on Bonapartist nostalgia in 1840's France, later having himself declared Emperor Napoleon III (retroactively declaring his uncle's deceased son to have been Napoleon II).

In the mid-'90s, new dictator Abacha put Dasuki under house arrest, and installed Maccido as Sultan, to general approval from the caliphate geeks.
</li><li> King Michael of Romania was a figurehead ruler during most of his reign in the 1930s and 1940s. A fascist dictator came to power in Romania, who allied his country with the Nazis. In 1944 Michael, along with several generals loyal to him, organized a coup against the fascists and became allied with the West and the Soviets. Romania's communist government forced the king into exile in 1947. He eventually returned in 1992 and on a more permanent basis in 1997 although Romania did not recognize him as their monarch. He died in 2017.

Simeonâ€”now styling himself Simeon Sakskoburggotski ("Saxe-Coburg-Gotha", using the name of his royal house<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note31x3v');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note31x3v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note31x3v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Yes, the same as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor">The House of Windsor</a> before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a></span> as his surname)â€”founded a political party and led it to victory in the 2001 elections, with Sakskoburggotski himself becoming Prime Minister. Incidentally, this is the only time a hereditary monarch has ever gone on to become a democratically elected head of government in <em>any</em> nation. It even fits the "situation in the country improves" bit of the tropeâ€”he appointed a cabinet of technical experts (though their actual competence is disputed) and Bulgaria grew and ran smoothly during his tenure. However, the Bulgarian voters grew tired of the massive corruption which his government was widely accused of and also how most of the growth seemed to flow to the rich, and left his party in second place in the 2005 elections (although the party ended up participating in a grand coalition led by the Socialists), and then wiped them out entirely in 2009 and Simeon retired from politics.<em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1mmka');"><sup>*Â </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1mmka" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1mmka');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He was also revealed to have been working with the communist secret services since the 70s, i. e. the group of people who dethroned him also orchestrated his return, as well as getting their party into the government, all while playing on the people's sympathies.</span></em>
<ul><li> Simeon II always advocated the restoration of the monarchy when living in exile, but after his return has remained silent on the issue. No matter how many times people ask him if he still wants to return to being Tsar (either as a figurehead constitutional monarch or with some degree of actual power), he gives no answer.
</li><li> Another example from the country's medieval history. In 1207, Tzar Kaloyan was usurped by his cousin Boril who banished the rightful heir, Ivan Assen II (along with his brother), sons of Kaloyan's older brother (Kaloyan himself has no sons). In 1217, an 18-year-old Ivan Assen II returned with his allies, besieged the capital, and seized the throne. This is portrayed in historiography as a rare example of this trope where an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle">Evil Uncle</a> had usurped a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolUncle">Good Uncle</a> instead of the rightful heir's father.
</li></ul></li><li> There is a loony conspiracy theory that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephStalin">Joseph Stalin</a> was a lost son of Alexander III. It makes some sort of sense, given that a few modern-day Stalinists are also monarchists who see Stalinist USSR as a continuation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia">Tsarist Russia</a>.
</li><li> Mohammed Zahir Shah of Afghanistan was deposed by his prime minister in 1973 while seeking medical treatments in Italy. During his exile, Afghanistan experienced a communist dictatorship, a civil war, and the rise of the Taliban. He returned to Afghanistan in 2002 after NATO began its occupation of that country, however, the Americans would not let him take the title of king. He was allowed to serve as an apolitical symbol of national unity.
</li><li> During the unification of Japan in the late 16th century, the most powerful and successful faction was led by three of Japan's greatest and most famous generals, Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu, who all wanted to be the ruler of Japan. Famous for his patience and being the youngest, Ieyasu left the position to Hideyoshi after Nobunaga's death and waited for his own time to come. However, at his death, his five-year-old son Hideyori was a problem and Ieyasu could not deny a dying man's request to protect his young child. Even though Ieyasu was quite successful in arranging that Hideyori had no intention to follow in his father's footsteps, Ieyasu realized that as long as the Toyotomi family existed, there would always be rebels gaining support by claiming to restore the rightful ruler of Japan to power. Though there are many sources that indicate that it pained Ieyasu deeply, the legacy of the Tokugawa family would only endure if Hideyori and his own young son were killed. Which they were.
<ul><li> Invoked during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MeijiRestoration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MeijiRestoration">Meiji Restoration</a>. During the 700 years of Bakufu rule in Japan, even the existence of the emperor was barely recognized. The rebel forces opposing the Tokugawa Shogun, however, took on the emperor as their figurehead and claimed to be merely restoring the rightful ruler to power. It had been many centuries since the last time a Japanese emperor had actually been <em>in</em> power, rather than just a figurehead whom the shogun controlled.
</li></ul></li><li> Zigzagged during the Liberal Wars in Portugal. Leading the Liberal forces was Dom Pedro, who was simultaneously the former crown prince, former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelPrince">Rebel Prince</a> (who led the former Portuguese colony of Brazil to independence), former king (briefly in 1826 after his father, Joao VI, had died), and the father of the deposed "rightful queen," Maria II.
</li><li> After the Khmer Rouge was overthrown from Cambodia, Norodom Sihanouk was restored as the King of Cambodia when the communists removed him.
</li><li> Subverted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CarolusRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CarolusRex">Charles XII of Sweden</a>, who returned to reclaim his throne after fourteen years of exile, but ended up being killed in battle before he could accomplish much.
</li><li> Joachim Murat, who had become the King of Naples by the grace of Napoleon, <em>attempted</em> to pull this off after the other rightful kings returned (the Neapolitan Bourbons driven away by the French). He managed to land in Calabria with a small group of loyal followers, hoping to rally the people's support, but he hardly got any further before he was arrested, tried, and shot.
</li><li> Kashyapa, king of Lanka, got his position by murdering his father and exiling his brother, Moggallana, who was the rightful heir. To absolutely no one's surprise, having made one of the most elementary mistakes when usurping a throne, Moggallana showed up again with an army and popular support to take the throne back.
</li><li> Justinian II of the Byzantine Empire. His first reign lasted from 685-695, when he was overthrown and his nose was either cut off or slit,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4kpez');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4kpez" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4kpez');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">According to Byzantine tradition, any physical imperfection was supposed to disqualify him from the throne, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToForce">but no one really argued that point with him when he returned</a>. </span> and he was exiled to the Crimea. However, after ten years in exile, Justinian managed to return to Constantinople with an army of Bulgars at his back, enter the city through an abandoned aqueduct, and reclaim his throne. Something of a real-life <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a>; his entire second reign was an extended, bloody <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a>, which meant that he alienated almost all of his allies (plus the fact that he just wasn't that good an emperor), and so in 711 he was overthrown again. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead">This time, permanently.</a>
