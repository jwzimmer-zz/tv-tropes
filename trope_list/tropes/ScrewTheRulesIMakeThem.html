When Belldandy points out that Article 26 only has four clauses, Chihiro grabs the rulebook and a pen and adds clause five on the spot. Nobody even tries to call her out on this.

It's no longer clear how fully he recognizes that he <em>didn't</em> change the rules.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>: During the Cell Games, Cell pulls this off. During his fight with Goku, he decides the ring is standing in the way of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">entertainment</a> and proceeds to blow it up, thus eliminating the risk of a victory by ringout.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>: The Tournament of Power was announced with a strict <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoItemUseForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoItemUseForYou">"no weapon" policy</a>. However, as several contestants started using specific items to defeat the others (such as Master Roshi using containers for the Evil Containment Wave and several universes giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">Potaras</a> to their champions), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod">the Zen'Os</a> - who organized the tournament in the first place - allowed these specific instances because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">they looked cool</a> (shutting down all the complaints with an enthusiastic smile and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare">Death Glare</a>).

How powerful is Wong? Well, thanks to Master Asia's victory in the Gundam Fight four years ago, Wong <em>rules the universe</em>. This allows him to screw the rules however he likes, from turning the Fight into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame">Deadly Game</a> where attacking the cockpit is allowed to allowing Fighters into the finals who were blatantly defeated and/or disqualified. His counterpart in the manga has a line predating Gilgamesh below:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Wong:</strong> To put it lightly, I don't just make the rules, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheNoun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheNoun">I am the rules</a>!
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse">Nasuverse</a></em>:
<ul><li> Gilgamesh of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CarnivalPhantasm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CarnivalPhantasm">Carnival Phantasm</a></em> said and does this word by word while stabbing Lancer with hundreds of blades with Gate of Babylon.
<div class="indent"> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheNoun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheNoun">I am the rules.</a>" - <strong>Gilgamesh</strong>
</div></li><li> Nero Claudius possesses the ability "Imperial Privilege EX", which basically lets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">her</a> say "I am the Emperor, so I decide what I am able to do!" It's what allows her to be a good fighter when historically Nero was no such thing (even in the Nasuverse): she decides she should be a good fighter, so she is. Skills she gains this way are only temporary though, and she will quickly forget them when they're not in use.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> overlaps this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiplomaticImpunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiplomaticImpunity">Diplomatic Impunity</a>. The World Nobles use their position as descendants of the Twenty Kings who originally founded the (highly corrupt) World Government to do as they please whenever and wherever they go, and <em>anyone</em> who tries to interfere with or touch them in anyway will face the full force of a Marine army. They're even allowed to shoot people in broad daylight without punishment.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This becomes especially evident when it's revealed that Donquixote Doflamingo, the most psychotic member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, is a former World Noble. He may have left them, but it still leaves him with enough power to outright deceive the entire world into believing that he had abdicated his position as a Warlord just to trick a mere ten people, something that would've been impossible otherwise. This becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a> when you realize that Doflamingo, a strong and influential pirate outside of his status as a World Noble, technically has dominion over the <em><strong>Admirals</strong></em>.</span>
</li><li> And if that isn't enough, during the battle of Marineford, Doflamingo gives a speech about how the ones with the most power get to decide this, and that Marineford was neutral ground due to the fact that everything is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners">Written by the Winners</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire">Rosario + Vampire</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">Kuyo</a>, the head of Yokai Academy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyPowerfulStudentCouncil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyPowerfulStudentCouncil">Student Police</a>, regularly exploited his authority to make the other students' lives as miserable as possible, and everyone is too afraid of him to try and stop it. It's only when Tsukune and co. give him a well-deserved ass-kicking that Kuyo finally pays his dues.
</li><li> Gold Watch from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ouroboros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ouroboros">Ouroboros</a>: The ones who can effortlessly crush that tiny life of yours should be the police too, right?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>:
<ul><li> Maximillion Pegasus is an interesting example. He abuses his position as creator of Duel Monsters to stack his deck cards that have never been released to the public because Pegasus himself felt they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">too powerful</a> for general circulation. Given that he constantly calls people like Keith on their own cheating (he even kills Keith for cheating in the manga via Penalty Game), it's pretty hypocritical. He also explicitly cheats by using his Millenium Eye to read the mind of his opponent (the cards in their hand, in particular) and counter their strategies before they can even use them.
</li><li> The Paradox Brothers seem to make up the rules of the labyrinth duel as they go, to the point where Joey accuses them of this trope. Even if they are cheating or lying about the rules, the rules they designed for the labyrinth duel are so convoluted that it's nearly impossible to tell if they're lying about things like all flying monsters being banned from the maze.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FillerVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FillerVillain">Filler Villain</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfanteTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfanteTerrible">Noah</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Kaiba</a> does the same thing. As the ruler of the Virtual World, Noah is able to enforce all of his Deck Master rules, frequently calling out his henchmen, The Big 5, when they either a) cheat in duels or b) attempt to leave the Virtual World without having first won a duel. Yet during his matches against Kaiba and Yugi/Yami, Noah cheats repeatedly, using Kaiba's brother as a shield against his attacks. When he's actually beaten by Yami, he steals Mokuba's body despite not having won a duel, and tries to escape into the real world, something he himself forbid The Big 5 from doing.
</li><li> Though when The Big 5 take over Honda's body, Noah does let them cheat. While there's nothing saying you can't fuse your Deckmaster with another monster, The Big 5 fuse all their own Deckmasters together, despite only being one player.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhVRAINS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhVRAINS">Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS</a></em>, during Speed Duels, players can use a one-per-duel special skill that has varying effects depending on the player (Playmaker, for example, can create an Extra Deck monster out of nowhere when his life points drop below 1000). During Master Duels, however, Skills are forbidden. Queen is able to use her Skill during a Master Duel account of being in charge of the company that designed the network and evidently having written herself in as an exception. She's even called on it, using this trope as a response.

In Dredd's case, this catchphrase refers to his absolute authority to punish violations of the law as he sees fit, not to making his own laws. On the contrary, in one storyline where he <em>is</em> authorized to make law on the spot to achieve the government's goals, he's very uncomfortable about it. The idea of the law being consistent and not playing favorites is very important to him, after all.

The next day the head passed a rule saying everyone walking on the streets at night must carry a lantern. That night, the same man bumped into him again, and showed the lantern to the annoyed village head and pointed out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">there is no rule that the lantern should have a candle</a>.

That night, the man bumped into him again, and this time the loophole was that the rule doesn't say the candle has to be lit. The embarrassed head cancelled the rule on the following day. At no point in the joke does the village head consider carrying a candle himself.

<ul><li> Many villains in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> series have this attitude. In particular the People's Republic of Haven's Legislaturalists, their successor the Committee of Public Safety, the Star Kingdom of Manticore's High Ridge Government, and the Solarian League's "Five Mandarins". All these groups consistently make the same blunder in overestimating just how much the people they rule over are willing to put up with and continuously trying to game their respective systems when it's abundantly clear they're making terrible mistakes.

<ul><li> A more benign version occurs in the fifth book, <em>How Firm a Foundation</em>. Empress Sharleyan has arrived in Corisande to pronounce sentencing on the traitors of the Northern Conspiracy. However, while the law is clear on their guilt and their punishment, Sharleyan uses her royal prerogative to pardon those who were blackmailed, threatened, duped, or just too angry or foolish to realize what they were getting into.
</li><li> The Group of Four are the more traditional example. Zhaspahr Clyntahn in particular is perfectly willing to write dispensations for the very technological advances he condemns for the specific purpose of making sure those advances can be used <em>by</em> the Church to crush the heretics.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnimalFarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnimalFarm">Animal Farm</a></em>, the dictator pig Napoleon rewrites the original constitution of Animal Farm multiple times to make his actions legal (since most animals are dumber than pigs, they didn't realise the secret rewritings). Eventually all the laws on equality and freedoms are reduced to one, "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BraveNewWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BraveNewWorld">Brave New World</a></em> World Controller Mustopha Mond, responding to Bernard's shock that he owns banned books, explains that "As I make the rules, I can also break them.

When the actual authorities return, they are <em>not</em> amused.

When she expresses surprise that Aslan could be affected by a simple spell, he replies "do you think I wouldn't follow my own rules?"

Modesitt Jr.</a>'s <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCoreanChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCoreanChronicles">The Corean Chronicles</a></em>. When Mykel's wastrel brother Venicet shows up in Tempre and expects to be given a cushy court position just because he's the brother of the newly declared Lord Protector, Mykel flat out tells him that he couldn't provide his brother with a steady income unless he was willing to take a steady job, as this was the rule he had laid down for everyone else, and as ruler he couldn't decree one thing and do something else. Then he gave his brother what pocket change he had on him and showed him the door.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deryni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deryni">Deryni</a></em> works, Edmund Loris <em>was</em> Archbishop of Valoret and Primate of All Gwynedd, but in the aftermath of the schism in <em>High Deryni</em>, he was stripped of his office and imprisoned in a monastery. On his escape, he simply takes up where he left off, calling himself Primate when he first confronts Istelyn and takes him prisoner in <em>The Bishop's Heir</em>. So far as he's concerned, Cardiel, Arilan, Istelyn and the rest are the traitors to the Church, and he Loris is the only one who can bestow that label. (Naturally, Istelyn doesn't agree; in a subsequent argument after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dhugal's escape with Sidana and Llewell's capture by Kelson's forces</span>, Istelyn reminds Loris that the bishops deprived him of his office and its authority.) When the new Primate Archbishop Bradene sends a writ of excommunication against Loris, Judhael, Caitrin, and their followers, Loris claims it has no force. In response to this, Loris strips Istelyn of his office as priest and excommunicates him (on the basis of his old authority) expressly so Istelyn can be executed (hanged, drawn and quartered) as a traitor.
</li><li> Lord Vetinari, the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> novels, <em>can</em> say this, although he prefers not to. Anyway, he has established legal precedent going thousands of years on his side, namely "Ego sic dico."
<div class="indent"><strong>Vetinari</strong>: The law must be obeyed, Miss Dearheart. Even tyrants have to obey the law. [<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">Beat</a>] No, I tell a lie, tyrants do <em>not</em> have to obey the law, obviously, but they do have to observe the niceties.

</li><li> Sam Vimes' ancestors served as a means to ensure that the rulers of Ankh Morpork would not do this for too long. Vetinari knows about this, though whether he fears Vimes is doubtful. He does acknowledge Vimes as a force to reckon with, though, and prefers to work with him, not against him. (This <em>may</em> be because "in a world of curves, [Vimes] moves in straight lines", which Vetinari finds useful.)

Conveniently enough, Lord Drake doesn't register himself despite being a spiritkin, a talent and an arcane mage. Lampshaded by Jona, when, after Ember mentions this information, he asks, "Of course not, who makes laws and then follows them himself?"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>

</li><li> And similarly, Minister Fudge with his "Laws can be changed!" when he clearly is circumventing the legal lawmaking process. Which was actually hilarious, because the invoked law was necessary self-defense. So Fudge meant that he could change the law so that when you're attacked in Muggle territory, it would be illegal to defend yourself!
</li><li> The Ministry of Magic misrepresent their powers multiple times by threatening Harry with punishment they have no authority to carry out. First in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</a></em> when a house-elf casts a spell in the Dursley residence in the presence of muggles, they send Harry a letter informing him that he has broken the law and that further infringement may lead to expulsion from Hogwarts (in reality the Ministry doesn't have the legal authority to suspend Hogwarts students). In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a></em>, after Harry has used magic to defend the lives of himself and his cousin, the Ministry sends hims a letter stating that he has in fact been suspended from Hogwarts and that a ministry official would arrive soon to destroy his wand (which they don't have the authority to do either, at least not without a trial). They might have carried out their threat if Dumbledore hadn't been on the ball. However, even after Dumbledore had reminded the Minister of Magic of the law, the Ministry still maintained in their follow-up letter to Harry that he should "consider himself suspended from school pending further enquiries."
</li><li> Arthur Weasley did this with his enchanted car. Enchanting muggle items to do things other than what they were originally designed for is illegal. For example, enchanting the car to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerOnTheInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerOnTheInside">Bigger on the Inside</a> is legal since it was designed to carry passengers and cargo in the first place. But enchanting it to fly is illegal, since cars are obviously not intended to do that. But the law in question was written by the head of the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office...Arthur Weasley. He wrote the law so that such enchantments would be allowed if he didn't intend to actually use them. Thus creating a loophole that allowed him to enchant his car with abilities he saw fit, apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe">because it amused him</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames">The Hunger Games</a></em>, the Gamemasters bring up the possibility of two victors in the normal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereCanBeOnlyOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereCanBeOnlyOne">There Can Be Only One</a> challenge, only to revoke it when that possibility actually becomes reality. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They didn't count on the survivors trying to commit suicide to spite them, so they flip-flopped <em>again</em> to prevent the two from becoming martyrs.</span>

It's her wiser advisors, realizing that the circumstances of the rebellion mean mercy would be the better ploy, who tell her, "The law of the land is the Queen" — setting a very bad precedent, but executing <em>these</em> rebels would cause major and possibly worse problems.

He then backs it up by firing the <em>entire</em> cardiac surgeon staff (he hires one back) and saying that "anyone who puts billing over patient care is terminated, no matter how much money they bring in." He then tells other surgeons they'll be getting actual attendings and not just college med students with no training. He ignores the number of doctors leaving (some calling their lawyers) as he continues to declare that they are no longer going to use the excuse of "the system is too big to change because we <em>are</em> the system." Over the course of the series, Goodwin shows he's all too willing to reshape the status quo of the hospital over the objections of the board.

<ul><li> The heel General Managers aren't much better...and usually once they screw the rules too much, they're in line for a firing or a major beatdown from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">face</a> wrestler they've likely been feuding with for the past few months.
</li><li> There have been matches where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel">Heel</a> was allowed to alter the stipulations of the match, during the match, as many times as they want.
</li><li> A running theme in pro wrestling is the claim that no one, not even the owner, can override a referee's decision. This is countered by the fact that the owner or GM <em>can</em> change the rules of the match, even retroactively. So the referee's ruling of a disqualification, for example, isn't overridden, it's just that it no longer matters because it just retroactively became a no disqualification match.
</li><li> It should be noted that while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley">Mick Foley</a> was Commissioner in 2000, he would overrule the referee's decision in two different pay per view main events without actually changing the rules, both times causing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisBenoit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisBenoit">Chris Benoit</a> to lose out on winning the heavyweight title, once because Foley never saw <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheRock">The Rock</a> actually cause a disqualification (the referee was groggy and thought Rock had hit him with a chair and the title was allowed to change hands on a disqualification) and the other time because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> had his foot on the rope and the groggy referee didn't notice it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShaneMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShaneMcMahon">Shane McMahon</a>, who was managing Benoit at the time, would point out the running theme that authority figures <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">weren't allowed to override a referee's decision</a>, but the outcome remained the same anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot">Worked Shoot</a> variant came during the 2005 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble">Royal Rumble</a>, in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista">Batista</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> <em>both</em> fell over the top rope at the end of the match, landing at the same time. Because of the recent brand split, the RAW referees sided with Batista while Smackdown refs declared Cena the winner, which kept the theme of the night going while those in the back frantically worked at a solution. This was a botch; Batista was supposed to catch himself while Cena fell but went over with more momentum than planned. Fortunately he didn't hit the floor ahead of Cena and thus the original plan could go forward. While the General Managers of RAW and Smackdown had both already left since their roles in the PPV were over, the quick-thinking referees were able to buy time for legitimately angry Vince McMahon to come to the ring and restart the match. And infamously tore both of his quadriceps muscles while climbing into the ring.
</li><li> A particularly egregious example would be the match between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho">Chris Jericho</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WilliamRegal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WilliamRegal">William Regal</a> at <em>Backlash 2001.</em> Because Regal challenged Jericho to a "Duchess Of Queensbury Rules" match, and Jericho accepted without knowing what that was, it turned out that Regal was allowed to change the rules whenever he was about to lose. Possibly the worst pro wrestling example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Calvinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Calvinball">Calvinball</a> ever.
</li><li> In the WWE, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulHeyman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulHeyman">Paul Heyman</a> was a general manager, his first act was to put one of the faces into a match. Then no less than 4 times during the match, he'd grab a microphone and say "I'm sorry, I forgot because it's my first day. This match is actually..." and he'd add another stipulation to the match.

<ul><li> One of the major themes of the Problem of Evil (used in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil">God Is Evil</a>" plots) asks whether God is allowed to do something that goes against his own code of morality. If he is, can he still be considered omnibenevolent? And it he can't, can he still be considered omnipotent? Usually the response is either 1. Yes, God has every capability to do actions against his morality, but he has no reason to. His power is such that he can solve any problem with benevolence, whether or not evil can do with malice (Saying that only benevolent means are used contradicts the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMysteriousWays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMysteriousWays">In Mysterious Ways</a> idea; Also, focusing on the Moral side of the argument: in some monotheistic religions, the god in question forbids a set of deeds, like murder, but is claimed to perform actions contradicting those teachings <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">because they can</a>, without being called out on it). 2. Morality is defined by the dictates of God, so the question is meaningless (The god in question IS the personification of morality with all his actions). Plato would have a problem with this line of reasoning, but then again, he never thought his gods were omnibenevolent or omnipotent to begin with, (However, Plato's idea of "The ultimate good" wasn't exactly about the Hellenic gods) or 3. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToForce">Go away kid, ya bother me.</a>
<ul><li> Best exemplified by a quote from Epicurus: "Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both willing and able? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil">Then whence comes evil?</a> Is he neither able nor willing? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion">Then why call him God?</a>"
</li></ul></li><li> Invoked without all that bothersome morality by the classic philosophical question, "Can God create a boulder so large that He Himself cannot lift it?" It's a logical problem of omnipotence; if he can't create a boulder too large to lift, he's not all-powerful, and if he can, then he's still not all-powerful. This is sometimes accused of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeggingTheQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeggingTheQuestion">Begging the Question</a>, since it takes God being constrained by logic (which an all-powerful being would not be by definition) as an assumption.
</li><li> This is also a common explanation for the performance of miracles in monotheistic religions. As God created the laws of nature, he can suspend or violate them at will to do things that would normally be impossible.

As the Great Curse laid upon them by their vanquished foes, the Primordials (titans) started to corrupt them more and more, their rule became more and more tyrannical and cruel. Note that within his domain, a Solar had the right to set almost anything that doesn't threaten the rule of Solars in general as a law, which resulted in some pretty horrible places to live, as well as some pretty... bizarre laws and customs (a whole region in the North where people acted like they lived in a musical!).

No. No it does not. Fortunately, Inquisitors who go rogue get the Inquisition on their tails pretty fast.
</li><li> All bodies of the Imperium are obligated to incarcerate psykers and either execute or dragoon them into service. No one touches the Emperor who is far and away the most powerful psyker ever despite being dead and immobile, the various institutions have come up with reasons why including the Ecclesiarchy stating because of his divine nature the Emperor is exempt from laws against psykers. They don't even bother lying about it and try to pass it off as holy power rather than psy.

His mother Morathi has a similarly dismissive approach to following her own rules (as with her treatment of the Cults of Pleasure, which she outlawed, despite being a High Priestess of herself). To all the other Dark Elves their behaviour is a clear case of this trope, though Malekith and Morathi think it's a justified perk of being in charge. Whether Malekith and Morathi really do have the constitutional authority to behave in this fashion is a vexed question, given that "constitutional authority" to Dark Elves means "power to exercise one's tyrannical wishes when one wants".

<ul><li> Article 1 Section 5 of the US Constitution gives each chamber of Congress to set up their own rules as they see fit. This can lead to strange politics when Congress subverts its own rules by making new ones.
<ul><li> For example, the rule governing filibusters in the US Senate requires a two thirds majority (67 out of 100 senators) to invoke cloture, not even a sixty vote majority. Recently, the Senate changed those rules on filibusters in some cases to be just a bare majority (51).
<ul><li> To clarify, the Democrats changed this rule after getting fed up with Republican tactics to block Obama nominees that they did not like, effectively allowing the President to name anyone he wants to any position he can (a special exception was made that preserved the Supreme Court) so long as that person does not upset his party's sensibilities<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1wq7g');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1wq7g" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1wq7g');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This was after the minority GOP had filibustered <em>89</em> separate judgeship positions - all of which were filled under Trump</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">Gone Horribly Right</a> in 2016, when the Democrats failed to secure both the Senate and the White House and had no recourse on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>'s picks. To top it off, Republicans now like the rule so much, they have extended it to Supreme Court nominations in 2017, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">much to the Democrats' horror</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> As it goes, these changes on a whole do not play well with the erosion of checks on the Senate as handing more power to each party.
</li><li> Another example is that a quorum (ie a majority of the chamber's members) must be present to vote before any law can be passed. However, the rules of the House and Senate both presume that a quorum is always present unless a member demands a quorum call to actually count the members, or a roll call vote is held in which each member's vote of yes or no is recorded. Thus, if nobody shows up to a session to oppose a bill and demand a quorum, it can be "unanimously" passed by voice vote despite far less than a quorum having voted. This infamously happened with the so-called <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Sunday_Compromise">"Palm Sunday Compromise"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which was passed by the Senate with only 3 Senators present rather the required minimum of 51. Whether the House and Senate actually have the proper legal authority to handle quorums in this way, seeing as the quorum requirement is spelled out in the US Constitution rather than being a rule that Congress itself created, is up for debate.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinLutherKingJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinLutherKingJr">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> was quoted with saying, "Never forget that everything <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Hitler</a> did in Germany was legal." Believe it or not, he had a point:
<ul><li> The 'constitutional' basis for Nazi laws was the 1933 Enabling Act, which gave Hitler, as Chancellor, the power to make laws and change the constitution without consulting the Reichstag. So there was a rule that allowed Hitler to make the rules as and when he preferred, although he passed this law by way of things like arresting all the Communist party deputies and then not counting anyone who wasn't "present without excuse" to determine if enough representatives were present to pass the two-thirds threshold for constitutional amendments. Or like filling the building with SA troops to intimidate the deputies into voting for the act.
</li><li> Then the day after the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Long_Knives">Night of the Long Knives<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a second rule — <em>Ex post facto law</em> — was passed. In the field of criminal legislation, it violated every hitherto accepted principle of German law, but from the Nazi point of view this made the killings perfectly "legal".
</li></ul></li><li> The Trial of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXVI">Louis XVI of France</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">in 1792</a> produced some interesting arguments. Pretty much everyone agreed that Louis was guilty, but <em>why</em> he was seemed to be more important than <em>whether</em> he was:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolutionMajorFigures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolutionMajorFigures">Jean-Paul Marat</a>, despite generally being considered an enthusiastic advocate of execution in the rest of the revolution, took a surprisingly limited stance - Louis was only guilty if he had violated the constitution of 1791 (which of course Marat believed he had).
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNote/TheFrenchRevolutionMajorFigures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNote/TheFrenchRevolutionMajorFigures">Louis-Antoine Saint-Just</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThomasPaine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThomasPaine">Thomas Paine</a>, among others, argued that while the trial was necessary, it was making the wrong charges; simply having been King was in itself a crime and enough to make Louis guilty, despite the fact that Louis' kingship had been legal by the laws in place at the time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaximilienRobespierre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaximilienRobespierre">Maximilien Robespierre</a> largely accepted the aforementioned argument by Paine and Saint-Just, but took it even further; he argued that the trial was not even necessary because the very act of dethroning Louis and declaring France a Republic already made him guilty: putting him on trial meant accepting there was <em>some</em> possibility, however small, that Louis might be innocent, which meant putting the legitimacy of the Republic in doubt, and they could only hold a trial if the Republic was legitimate.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a> effectively said this in the interviews with David Frost (see the page quote) when discussing the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huston_Plan">Huston Plan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, in which he had given his approval to a plan calling for domestic burglary and illegal surveillance of suspected radicals. Note that he didn't get away with it when he tried, and people were rather shocked when he said it (or more accurately, that he said it so bluntly; people weren't <em>terribly</em> surprised to learn that "Tricky Dick" was a paranoid autocrat, but that he would say so out loud...).
<div class="indent"><strong>David Frost:</strong> So what, in a sense, you're saying is that there are times - the Huston Plan, or at least that part of it, was one of them - when the President can decide it's in the best interest of the nation, or something, and do something illegal? <br/><strong>Richard Nixon:</strong> Well, when the President does it, that means that it is <em>not</em> illegal.
</div></li><li> During one sack of the city of Rome, a Gaul general named Brennus offered to ransom the city in return for a payment of gold by weight. When some of the Roman tribunes noticed that the Gaul-provided weights for determining the ransom were fixed and dared to tell him this, he responded by unsheathing his sword, throwing it upon the scale as well, and telling them (presumably through a translator) "Vae victis" or "Woe to the vanquished."
<ul><li> <em>Vae victis</em> was a common Roman battle-cry; whether the battle cry is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppropriatedAppellation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppropriatedAppellation">taken from this incident</a> or Brennus was making an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho">Ironic Echo</a> of the legions that had repeatedly attacked his people, it makes for a powerful story.
</li><li> The example loses some impact when it reveals that, according to Roman historians, a Roman general named Camillus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">entered the city with an army</a>, put his own sword on the scale, and said "Non auro, sed ferro, recuperanda est patria" or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">"Not with gold, but with iron, will the fatherland be regained."</a> Cue a Gallic ass-kicking.
</li></ul></li><li> The Byzantine senator <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justinian_I">Justinian<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> fell in love with Theodora, an actress. It was totally illegal for senators to marry actresses, who were seen as very much the dregs of humanity. Justinian, however, happened to be not only the nephew of the Emperor but his most trusted adviser, so the law was promptly changed and he married Theodora. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">Later he succeeded his uncle as Emperor and, when faced with a rebellion, Theodora was the only person who advised him against fleeing. He defeated the rebellion and reigned for decades more, and is known to this day as "Justinian the Great."</a>)
</li><li> A lawsuit filed on July 3, 2013 <a class="urllink" href="https://www.courthousenews.com/Police-Commandeer-Homes,-Get-Sued/">alleges that the Henderson, NV police, after being denied usage of Anthony Mitchell's home for surveillance purposes, opted to instead take it by force<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Simply put, it's the first time the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Judicial_interpretation">Third Amendment<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has been invoked on the grounds of "Quartering soldiers" since the late '70s. Per the official report: <em>"It was determined to move to 367 Evening Side and attempt to contact Mitchell. If Mitchell answered the door he would be asked to leave. If he refused to leave he would be arrested for Obstructing a Police Officer. If Mitchell refused to answer the door, force entry would be made and Mitchell would be arrested."</em>
<ul><li> This particular rationale was later quashed by a judge, as police officers aren't members of the military - the lawsuit was allowed to proceed on the premise that it violated the 4th (unreasonable search and seizure) and 1st (Free Speech) Amendments, however.
</li></ul></li><li> There was a rule book laying out the expected behavior for Alcatraz that contained 53 rules. The last rule? "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AintNoRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AintNoRule">If you do something we don't have a rule for</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">we will make a rule up on the spot and punish you for it.</a>"
</li><li> Defied by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UlyssesSGrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UlyssesSGrant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>. While President, Grant was stopped for speeding. (Yes, in a horse-drawn carriage. The man loved his horses.) The cop who flagged Grant over immediately apologized after he realized whom he was talking to and offered to let the whole thing go. The President waved this off, replying "Officer, do your duty."
<p></p></li><li> Also inverted by Ho Chi Minh, who found himself stopped by an officer guarding a Communist base. The officer insisted that Ho provide some form of identification (he had forgotten his ID) to be let in. This is the equivalent of asking <em>the U.S. president</em> for ID to enter the White House. After some back and forth, the officer's superior arrived and started to tell him off for not recognizing Ho, but was waved aside as the junior officer was simply doing his duty.
</li><li> Played straight by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinPierce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinPierce">Franklin Pierce</a>, who ran over an old woman with his carriage, possibly while drunk. The one-term president faced down the arresting officer with the line "I am Mr. Pierce," and was eventually released.
</li><li> Civil asset forfeiture allows police officers to seize cash and property from people if they suspect that they were obtained by crime without people being formally charged. There's a perverse incentive for cops to seize large amounts of cash and cars from people on flimsy pretexts. Taken to the next level, it's also a wider symptom of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop">police corruption</a>. Needless to say, there is a significant movement to restrict or outlaw this as a violation of the 4th Amendment (unreasonable search and seizure) and/or 8th Amendment (excessive fines, <a class="urllink" href="https://a.msn.com/r/2/BBTR3Jd?m=en-us&amp;referrerID=InAppShare">under which rationale the Supreme Court ruled against it in 2019<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>).

At worst, they may even stop trusting all adults (yes, including even their own parents and older relatives, etc.) completely.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePowerBroker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePowerBroker">Robert Moses</a>, New York City's legendary infrastructure czar during the middle decades of the 20th century, used to like sort of invoking this trope in his later years when he'd let some newly hired young lawyer at one of the agencies he ran go on for a while expounding on a particular area of relevant law to whatever it was they were doing or trying to do, then stopping the fellow with "I know the law, young man ... I <em>wrote it</em>", which he actually had.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note59kf9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note59kf9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note59kf9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Moses, who never studied law, was said to know the law better than most lawyers. He didn't quite fit this trope because he had no rulemaking authority himself, but as a practical matter had drafted the laws in question earlier in his career in a way that gave him nearly unlimited latitude to do as he saw fit without real oversight; his influence over the city council and state legislature was such that if he really needed to change the law, it would have been done with little fuss.</span>

This is an extrapolation of the fact that modern currency, technically termed "fiat money", only has value in the first place because the government says it does. Under MMT, rather than providing the government with revenue needed to operate, taxes simply give the government a way to shape the economy to its preferences by incentivizing non-governmental entities to spend or not spend their money in particular ways.
</li><li> The Quakers have no formal clergy, believing that no one has the authority or right to intercede between you and God, including at your wedding, where they believe it's best to make your vows directly to God in front of witnesses but with no human third-party effectively giving you permission or approval. This didn't jibe with the religious establishment originally surrounding them in England or the New World, so, unsurprisingly, they once faced a lot of persecution for such practices, with courts refusing to recognize their marriages, declaring their children illegitimate, etc. Well, William Penn was a Quaker, so when he founded the British colony now known as the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, he was able to make it legal for two people to marry with witnesses only, no officiant required. (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/tying-your-own-knot-in-pennsylvania-couples-can-wed-through-a-self-uniting-marriage-license/Content?oid=1805655">Yes, the rule he made still exists today.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>)
</li><li> A common way people, usually children, annoy someone is to repeat every word they say. The person being imitated might try to say something self deprecating like "I am an idiot", but the imitator will usually reverse the insult by saying "you are an idiot" or simply agree with the insult saying "I know".
