<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a></em>, one of the upgrades for the explosive gel is to go off automatically when an enemy passes by one. While this helps somewhat, it limits you to knocking over one inmate per explosive, one at a time, whereas without it you could make more elaborate traps that knock out a cluster of enemies simultaneously (which is important if you want to get takedowns before they get up). And once you get the upgrade, you can't turn it off. The upgrade, while absent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity">Batman: Arkham City</a></em>, makes a reappearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamOrigins">Batman: Arkham Origins</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI">The Legend of Zelda I</a></em>: The Clock is a wonderful one-use item which freezes all enemies on the screen  however, it has an annoying tendency to drop from the last creature you kill on the screen, rendering it utterly useless. It also will leave moving Peahats invulnerable, and it also prevents Wall Masters from spawning  which sounds great at first, but the path to the boss often requires killing every Wall Master in the room to open the door or gain a key.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeldaIITheAdventureOfLink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeldaIITheAdventureOfLink">Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</a></em> lets you shoot sword beams when you are at full health. Unlike in the previous game, though, most of the enemies are completely immune to it. Additionally, the beam only travels a few feet before it disappears with a graphic like a popped soap bubble.
</li><li> Normally, the Mirror Shield allows you to reflect projectiles and light beams, enabling the solution of several puzzles, but in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LinksAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LinksAwakening">Link's Awakening</a></em>, it's used twice: to block the feathers from the Evil Eagle and to get past the flamethrower obstacle en route to Level 8.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Golden Skulltula token collection quest. You spend all of the game collecting the tokens the stupid spiders leave behind, which sum up to a grand 100, and for what? An endless supply of huge golden rupees, worth 200. That's kinda useless in a game in which you hardly ever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing">buy anything</a> because you get everything in the dungeons. At least it's not the only prize you get, because if it were, it would have been just plain cruel.
</li><li> One of those prizes is the Stone of Agony, which causes your controller to vibrate if near a Secret Grotto. Except if you don't have a Rumble Pak, that feature isn't enabled on your controller, so you're gonna need to either pick one up or just accept that you have a useless item. The Stone is even worse on the Virtual Console release — the Virtual Console doesn't include rumble, so the item does absolutely nothing! The revamped item for the 3DS remake instead plays a sound while making an icon appear on top of the screen, making it a lot more useful.
</li><li> The Golden Gauntlets are the final item you get in the game, and they're literally only used for 2 stone pillars that must be chucked out of your path. They have absolutely no use anywhere else and come way too late to be of any use; they don't even improve on the Silver Gauntlets' power to lift and hurl smaller boulders. Contrast that to their Titan's Mitt counterpart in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">A Link to the Past</a></em>, where they bust the sandbox wide open.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask">The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Couple's Mask. It takes you three Termina days to unlock and does absolutely nothing, save earning you a Heart Piece and being required for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>. However, the sidequest gives you a lot of other useful items along the way, such as other masks, a possible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonplaceRare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonplaceRare">empty bottle</a>, and a beautiful-yet-bittersweet romance subplot.
</li><li> At least the Couple's Mask is good for a Piece of Heart. Though also the result of several sidequests, some of which have strict timing, the Circus Leader's Mask has only one single practical purpose in the original version of the game: it makes a single sidequest easier. A sidequest that <em>must be completed to get the mask in the first place!</em> (While, yes, the game does have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">"Groundhog Day" Loop</a> mechanic, there's no real reason to complete this sidequest more than once unless you really want to see the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarshmallowHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarshmallowHell">Marshmallow Heaven</a> scene) The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">3DS version</a> adds a new sidequest that requires the retranslated Troupe Leader's Mask, so it's not quite as useless as before.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em> has five, count 'em, <em>five</em> notable examples of rather sad items:
<ul><li> The slingshot. Like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">Ocarina Of Time</a> it's the first item you receive and thus the first thing you get to play with. Unlike Ocarina, <em>all</em> it's good for is playing with. You'll use it during the target practice segment and then to kill one or two spiders and... from then on out you can stuff it in your inventory and never touch it again. The <em>only</em> things it is able to harm are Skullwalltullas and Keese, and it can knock down beehives... which the Gale Boomerang you get from the <em>first dungeon</em> is capable of, in addition to harming or at least stunning most enemies, not needing ammunition, retrieving items, and putting out fires.
</li><li> The Spinner from the Arbiter's Grounds would be an awesome item if it retained its speed on the ground like it does on rails. Instead, it only carries Link a short distance before slowing to a crawl, and its attack has both low range and deals scratch damage. At least it's still somewhat useful throughout the game, but a huge letdown compared to how well it works during the boss battle of the Arbiter's Grounds.
</li><li> The Dominion Rod is a contender for one of the most useless items in <em>Zelda</em> history. Its description makes it sound great, being a rod that can bring statues to life. In reality, all it basically lets you do outside the Temple of Time once Shad powers it back up again is move six obstacles — eight if you also take on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Cave of Ordeals</a> in its entirety — throughout the entire rest of the game out of the way, and once that's done it has no more use at all.
</li><li> Both the Spinner and Dominion Rod are powered up massively in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors">Hyrule Warriors</a></em>, where the former essentially works as a lightning-elemental skateboard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleTops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleTops">Battle Top</a> that can create an infinite number of copies of itself that can be used as traps, and the latter can manifest the said statues anywhere, where they proceed to go to town on enemies when Zelda brandishes it.
</li><li> The Horse Call. In theory, it would be great: a portable horse grass that you could use to call Epona anywhere in the game. Unfortunately, you don't get it until you're almost through the entire game and by then you can just use Midna to warp almost anywhere, with Link's wolf form being almost if not as fast as the horse to fill the gaps. Adding insult to injury is the fact that you actually receive the item earlier in the Hidden Village, but at that point it is called Ilia's Charm and can't be used until you <em>show it to her</em> again.
</li><li> The powered up master sword obtained in lieu of a dungeon item from the Palace of Twilight is only marginally useful as it's able to one-punch Twilit Enemies (Which are non-threats as the unpowered sword can kill them in one or two hits already) and clearing out Shadow Crystal Fog (Like using the Lantern to clear poison fog). The power up doesn't work outside of the Palace of Shadow, which makes it nothing more than a form of dungeon key. It would be fine if it worked everywhere, or even if it was obtained much earlier in the game, but as the item for the Penultimate Dungeon it falls into the same letdown bucket as the Golden Gauntlets mentioned above.
</li><li> In addition to the weak dungeon items, the HD version also added Miiverse stamps. They're effectively emojis that can be used in your Miiverse posts, so within the game itself they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessItem">completely useless</a>. They were placed in existing chests, replacing consumable items that would have been found in older versions, so it can be rather disappointing and even frustrating to work for a chest only to get a reward that doesn't help at all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> — even considering money isn't worth much in the game, at least finding rupees was <em>situationally</em> useful and helped out in the early game. It's become even worse now that Miiverse has been shut down, as the stamps now serve no purpose whatsoever.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace">Western-themed</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">Zelda-clone</a> <em>Gunple: Gunman's Proof</em> has the Scattershot: tapping A rapidly causes the character to fire randomly in all directions. Because the individual shots are so spread out and weak they are very unlikely to even hit a foe, and when they do they inflict <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> at most. Even when absolutely surrounded by enemies you'll have a much easier and faster time dealing with them one-by-one. Thankfully the powerup is actually very difficult to even use as it requires very fast button-mashing to activate, so odds are you won't trigger it by mistake and will forget it even exists in very short order.
</li><li> <em>Super House Of Dead Ninja</em> features two of them. The flippers let you run on water, but are of only dubious usefulness as there's very little water in the game and you can usually just jump over it or have to swim through it anyway. The best reason to take the flippers when they're offered is so that the game will stop wasting valuable powerups on flippers! Still, they're better than the parachute, which slows the rate at which you fall. Falling doesn't harm you regardless of the height, but they can sometimes let you see something painful you're going to fall on and take evasive action... except you can generally achieve the same ends by grasping the wall and slowing your fall that way. So, really, it isn't of much positive use. Worse, the slow fall in certain rooms triggers nearby floor-snakes, making it impossible for you to get points for them, and can leave you vulnerable to certain enemies and bombs you would have otherwise sped past.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ToeJamAndEarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ToeJamAndEarl">Toe Jam And Earl</a></em> has the rocket skates: Incredibly fast, hard to steer, impossible to stop. When used, they immediately launch the player directly south, regardless of what direction they were facing, and one can only change direction 90 degrees from one's current direction. (You <em>can</em> control which direction you blast off if you're already moving when you open the items menu — the characters' idle animations are always turned towards the player.) The skates are fast enough that one can cover a lot of ground in the time it takes to do a 180, and it's easy to wind up flying over the edge and falling to a lower level... multiple times. While there is a time and a place to use them, that time and place consists of "when there is absolutely no worse place to be than where you are right now." Probably an intentional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonMushroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonMushroom">Poison Mushroom</a>, but they can actually be used on the bottom level (mostly water) to reach a secret area. And then you can jump off the secret area and be teleported back to the highest level you were on.
<ul><li> The game has a few presents that can either be good or bad depending on the situation, complicated by presents being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Roguelike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Roguelike">tough to identify</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed">The Force Unleashed</a></em> has the Lightning Shield, which gives you a damaging aura. Unfortunately, it lasts far too short to be of any use, eats up force power like crazy, doesn't let you regenerate force power while it's active, and has a long windup that leaves you vulnerable.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">Wii version</a> has this in trope in spades. All of the powers that work off of lightsaber combos are not only very weak, but are hampered by the lightsaber being tied to poorly coded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Waggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Waggle">wiimote inputs</a>. The one that takes the cake, though, is Dark Rage, which makes you regenerate pathetic amounts of Force Energy when you hit with said useless lightsaber attacks. It has all of the problems of Lightning Shield <em>and</em> has a habit of going off on accident when you try to dash away or block after a combo, then start being spammed like crazy without any input from you. Just to reiterate, it's a Force Energy regenerating move that doesn't give you enough regen to compensate for the loss of natural regen and has a tendency to leave you wide open when you try to back off in a fight.
</li></ul></li><li> Both the Super Charge and the Super Jump power-ups in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spyro2RiptosRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spyro2RiptosRage">Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage!</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroYearOfTheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroYearOfTheDragon">Spyro: Year of the Dragon</a></em>. The Super Charge makes you run uncontrollably forward and is associated with painful segments like the Fracture Hills Door Sidequest, making its usage seem less like a power up and more like "Oh God it's THIS thing again". The Super Jump just throws Spyro high into the air once, effectively making it like just another bridge or floating platform found in every single level. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Yay</a>. They just don't compare to soaring through the air, turning Spyro's fire breath into a BFG, or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">both combined</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BraveFencerMusashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BraveFencerMusashi">Brave Fencer Musashi</a></em> has some <em>great</em> abilities and items, but they can't all be gems:
<ul><li> Nearly all the curative items are worthless, save for the ones with secondary effects like the S-Revive that automatically resurrects you upon death, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">cheese is so insanely more effective</a> it's really the only healing item worth carrying. It's cheap, it's available right at the beginning of the game without having to rescue anyone or perform any sidequests, it doesn't spoil, it heals HP <em>and</em> BP, the longer you carry it the more effective it becomes, and even when first bought it easily restores a cool 200 HP / BP. The only healing item that does better than it is the Neatball which is more expensive and restores 300 HP / BP, but said item doesn't age like cheese which will eventually heal more than it and it is only available late in the game after rescuing some people.
</li><li> The Sky Scroll lets you fly, which you'd think would make it great, but unlike every other scroll that grants you new abilities to explore the world and help <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningTheSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningTheSandbox">open the sandbox</a> one-by-one, the Sky Scroll only works in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a> so its "usefulness" is limited to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman">floating over those spikes that were put there to give you an obstacle to bypass with the Sky Scroll</a>.
</li><li> The L-Glove is a unique specimen. On one hand an item that greatly increases critical hits <em>would</em> be very useful. What makes it this is you have to choose between getting the L-Glove or the L-Quilt, and the quilt allows you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">fully restore HP, BP, and fatigue for free whenever you want</a>. Compared to that, "doing a bit extra damage sometimes" is a <em>spectacular</em> letdown.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> with the various items you find that Connors needs to appraise. They always come with dramatic names that imply they may be pieces of the legendary armor, like "shield", "old sword", and "helmet", but when appraised these things become a frisbee, a shovel, and a bed pan. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Let's hope Musashi didn't try that helmet on!</a>

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallZTheLegacyOfGoku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallZTheLegacyOfGoku">Dragon Ball Z: Buu's Fury</a></em>, the Elder Kai powers up Gohan, making him much stronger but taking away his ability to go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Saiyan</a>, just like he does in the show. The problem is that in game terms, "powering him up" means giving him a lot of level ups, which could have easily been achieved through basic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a>, while going Super Saiyan is THE way to actually win fights because of its massive boost to speed. On top of that, the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a> weighted training clothes reduce your character's speed. Normally going Super Saiyan more than makes up the difference and grants a power boost to boot, but with the Elder Kai's "powerup", this becomes impossible. The obvious option of simply not using the weighted clothes means Gohan will level up slower, which means even his slight theoretical stat advantage soon falls apart. This "powerup" single-handedly turns Gohan into the worst character in the game. What makes this even worse is that the early-game Great Saiyaman form gives Gohan a large speed boost just for being in the form, which is entirely determined by the plot, and never seen again past the World Tournament. The Elder Kai's boost does nothing of the sort. So we have a solid example of a way the developers could have easily avoided this powerup's massive suck, but for some inexplicable reason chose not to. The irony is that in the manga/anime, this power-up elevates Gohan into literally being the single most powerful non-fused being in existence, such that he doesn't even need to be Super Saiyan to wipe the floor with anyone, and of course that the anime actually featured a tactic similar to the game's mechanic of sacrificing speed for a "power boost"... which was soon decried as <em>useless</em>.
</li><li> The Eyeclops helmet in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidChameleon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidChameleon">Kid Chameleon</a></em> has a default (green) beam that does no damage, but reveals invisible blocks, something that one can find for themselves through casual trial-and-error searching. Its secondary (white) beam <em>does</em> damage enemies...but only the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> you fight, and it only damages them the equivalent of one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp">Goomba Stomp</a> while draining your gem total like candy. The only thing you might want from it 90% of the time is the extra unit of life it gives you, when there's no other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUp">Power Ups</a> to be found.
<ul><li> That being said, it does have two uses. Due to the secret block mechanics of the game, it can reveal secret blocks which are otherwise impossible to see or activate, and in some levels, it will reveal bridges over spikes - and indeed, there are a couple levels where it is essentially mandatory for that reason. Sadly, this means you are stuck playing the entire level in the worst outfit in the game - indeed, apart from the life total issue, Kid Chameleon's base form is actually better than Eyeclops.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosMelee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosMelee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a></em> has the Cloaking Device, which blocks damage but still lets people knock you around or throw you (how KOs happen in Smash Bros.), and makes it hard for you to see yourself while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">not really causing the computer any trouble.</a> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0vqft');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0vqft" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0vqft');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">If you're playing with all humans, Cloak becomes useful. It still loses its initial purpose if you're using the names system to record stats for your many many fights: Names are permanently visible just above your character's location, utterly negating the point of being invisible. If you don't use names, there is still the occasional P# marker, especially if you stand still for too long. The only purpose the Cloaking device serves is to negate damage buildup... which they probably did just to <em>give</em> it a purpose.</span>
<ul><li> Several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssistCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssistCharacter">Assist Trophies</a> fall under this trope:
<ul><li> Devil, who moves the stage around, changing the boundaries and making it harder for both the opponents and the summoner to maneuver. His trophy description acknowledges how he isn't really helping.
</li><li> Helirin doesn't help the summoner at all, only acting as a temporary platform—and a terrible one at that, as it slowly spins around so you can't even stand on it for very long.
</li><li> Resetti, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments">entertaining,</a> doesn't do much as far as helping his summoner. The only damage he can do is explode, and that's only if somebody decides to hit him enough times.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nintendogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nintendogs">Nintendogs</a> will stand in front of the camera and paw at it like a glass window, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">obscuring most of the player's view</a>.
</li><li> Tingle is an odd case: His balloon spell does nothing, his hammer spell just spawns hammers that everyone can use, his fire spell causes everyone to start breathing fire, and his zoom effect only harms the summoner slightly less than it does the opponents. His banana spell is the only one that doesn't harm the summoner.
</li><li> Isabelle spawns health-restoring fruit that any player can pick up. Fortunately, she always aims toward her summoner, and the summoner has the added benefit of automatically eating the fruit instead of having to grab it like everyone else. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable">She didn't last.</a>
</li><li> Nightmare completely obscures the vision of everyone.
</li><li> All of Skull Kid's effects involve flipping the camera upside-down or backwards, affecting everyone—including the summoner.
</li></ul></li><li> Some of the Poké Ball Pokémon also qualify:
<ul><li> Goldeen uses Splash when summoned, which does absolutely nothing. The fourth game introduces a Poké Ball item that can only summon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Olympus Mons</a>...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">with a rare chance of summoning Goldeen instead.</a>
</li><li> Mew, Jirachi, and Celebi drop rare collectible items like trophies, stickers, and CDs, but otherwise does nothing. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></em>, Mew does nothing since none of these items exist.
</li><li> Munchlax will simply run around the stage and eat any item it finds, which can be irritating if that item happens to be a Dragoon part or a healing item.
</li></ul></li><li> Wario's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Final Smash</a> in the games where it's controllable is an <em>amazing</em> ability, vastly increasing the strength of Wario's moveset and making him pretty much invincible. However, one of its changes is to the Wario Bike, increasing its speed to the point that it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooFastToStop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooFastToStop">Too Fast to Stop</a>. (The official website suggests that this was intentional.) Even if you have good enough reflexes to not kill yourself, it'll probably send you hurtling past the opponent and eat up precious time for the ability to run out.
</li><li> Due to the procedurally-generated equipment in the fourth game, it's entirely possible to get, for example, an extremely rare Extra-Large Egg or Decadent Lollipop with the same Attack boost but a worse Defense penalty than a much less rare Rare Brawn Badge already in your inventory.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat2">Mortal Kombat II</a></em>, if you play as Reptile, you can turn invisible. While this is somewhat useful while playing against humans, it's completely and utterly useless while playing against the computer, which still knows exactly where you are all the time. Furthermore, since the invisibility is total, it makes it impossible for you to see the character, which makes the game harder for the player. Later games in the series have modified the ability so the invisibility is not total.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallXenoverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallXenoverse">Dragon Ball Xenoverse</a></em>, the Kaioken abilities, especially Kaioken x20. Since the first game only gave Saiyans transformations, the other races were forced to use Kaioken until they were able to unlock Potential Unleashed. The three levels of Kaioken (normal, x3 and x20) used increasing amounts of Stamina to use and there was only one skill that restored Stamina unlike the Super Saiyan abilities, who used ki and could be easily restored any number of ways.

It's a helicopter turret you can walk around with... at a very slow pace, with a slightly faster killing time than other weapons, except it takes a bit longer to spin up than it does for most guns to aim down the sights and put three in your chest. It's even worse in Hardcore, where every gun is a one hit kill save a few at long range, so it doesn't even offer faster killing. The Death Machine fairs better in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NaziZombies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NaziZombies">the Zombie maps</a>; the rapid firepower and no reload really helps with the horde of zombie rushing at you.

<ul><li> The titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement">Sword of Plot Advancement</a> can be upgraded over the course of the game through use.

</li><li> Upgrade the jump, and it does what you would expect: it makes you jump higher, which is useful.

Top (or, uh, bottom) among these would be environmental training, demolition, aqualung, run silent and energy shield. While some pointless items can be blamed on insufficient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTailoredToTheParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTailoredToTheParty">balancing in the campaign</a>, the issue of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTiers">which are best and worst</a> is a hotly contested one. The devs seemed to be at least partially aware of this since they are cheap. Being so cheap, some of these marginal skills are worth a single rank for the improvement the first level gives you. The prequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a></em> has its own set of potentially useless or useful only in specific circumstances set of augments.
</li><li> Blur Artifacts in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom 2</a></em> when facing projectile shooting enemies. They make you harder to see, with the effect that monsters have a very poor aim when trying to shoot you. The problem is that most players will instinctively sidestep as soon as they see their attack animation, and are more likely to dodge into a stray projectile than get hit by a projectile aimed straight at them. Fortunately, not all is lost; against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitScan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitScan">Hitscan</a> enemies, the partial invisibility significantly reduces their accuracy, rendering them far more manageable when fought in groups.
</li><li> The Long Jump Module in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em> is tricky to use since it requires the player to be sprinting, do a crouch, and then immediately jump afterwards to do the long jump. The tutorial mode teaches you about the long jump fairly early, but you don't actually get the long jump upgrade in the main campaign until you're at the end of the game.
</li><li> Shadowspheres are also dangerous in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Heretic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Heretic">Heretic</a></em>, more so than the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> Blur Artifact example above. All attacks are slow projectiles, and enemies generally fire multiple projectiles at once. The most extreme example is D'Sparil, who will sometimes summon additional mooks. These mooks will launch a 3-way spread attack, and if D'Sparil summons enough of them, they will cause an entire area to be carpeted in shots. Not using the artifact is safer, since they only aim directly at the player. The artifact does have a few lesser known advantages, notably in making you immune to the undead warrior's axe projectiles, and preventing the iron lich's tornado attack from following you.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em>:
<ul><li> Many games include murderously hard puzzles whose reward turns out to be nothing more than a small increase to your missile or Power Bomb capacity. Even worse, the designers of fan hacks like <em>Super Metroid Redesign</em> take this as a <em>challenge</em>.
</li><li> The Ice Beam from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metroid1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metroid1">Metroid 1</a></em> immobilizes enemies - and does a piddly one damage. The Wave Beam, which moves in a sine pattern to fix the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenialOfDiagonalAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenialOfDiagonalAttack">Denial of Diagonal Attack</a> issue, is far superior, but you need the Ice Beam to complete the game since Metroids can only be made vulnerable by freezing them. Later games soften the blow by not making them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutuallyExclusivePowerups" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutuallyExclusivePowerups">Mutually Exclusive Powerups</a>, buffing the Ice Beam's damage, and making it so most frozen enemies take a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> from missiles.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid">Super Metroid</a></em> has the four reserve tanks. While far from useless  they are an extra 400 points of health after all  their relative complexity, such as the fact that you have to fill them manually like certain similar Sub-Tanks, with them serving as "extra energy" like fairies, makes one wonder why they couldn't have simply been another four energy tanks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em> has the Flamethrower, the Plasma Beam's Charge Combo. Unlike the Super Missile (powerful with fast velocity) and the Wavebuster (automatically locks onto enemies for you), the Flamethrower has extremely short range and isn't powerful enough to kill anything quickly. Likewise, the Ice Spreader fires too slowly to be of any use and has a slight delay before the shot is made, though unlike the Flamethrower, it's at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless">useful against the final boss</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a></em> has similar problems with the Darkburst, Sunburst, and Sonic Boom. However, it does a slightly better job at making them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless">Not Completely Useless</a> - the Darkburst does <em>ludicrous</em> amounts of damage to Dark Samus (since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">Dark Samus is technically a "light world" creature</a>), and the Sonic Boom can take off nearly half of the final boss's health with a single shot if the whole blast connects. The Sunburst is still fairly useless though, simply due to its extremely slow firing speed and ammo consumption.

<ul><li> In particular, beating the final Leviathan boss (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ridley</span>, whose arrival is always a big deal) gets you the nearly useless Hyper Grapple. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note109k8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note109k8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note109k8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">To be fair, the Hyper Grapple doesn't have much use because it's the last powerup you get in the game and there isn't much you can do with it, but it's the only way to reliably vent Phazon at 99% corruption.</span>
</li><li> The Hyper Ball: as long as you don't spend Phazon or wait too long, you can freely move into and out of the invincibility-granting Hyper Mode without ever losing any health. Before getting the Hyper Ball, you can drop bombs that cost no Phazon while in hypermode. After you get the Hyper Ball, the bombs are replaced with an attack consisting of giant energy tendrils that don't really do anything aside from destroying Phazon growths in certain places. Without the Hyper Ball, then, Morph Ball Bombs are essentially a way to deal damage while invincible. (This is a very useful property against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Mogenar</a>.) <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2wxpt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2wxpt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2wxpt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">You're not eternally invincible, though; you have to time your movements in and out of Hypermode to avoid Terminal Corruption, but you can protect yourself well enough if you understand the mechanics. Of course, given Mogenar's the one who gives you the Hyper Ball in the first place...</span>
</li><li> The Hazard Shield, while giving you boosted defense, is supposed to protect you from hazardous substances, namely acid rain and fuel gel. By the time you get this item, there's barely anything that requires this power up anyway.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Black Tarot cards in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Painkiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Painkiller">Painkiller</a></em> tend to vary between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> and this trope, especially considering how difficult some of these cards can be to collect. Some of the worst of these include Greed (which doubles the amount of gold found in breakable items, but which in itself already costs 2000 gold to place) and Divine Intervention (which allows the player to place any cards they want for free, but can only be earned at the very end of the game on the highest difficulty, by which point the amount of gold at hand is probably not an issue, and unequipping the card instantly removes all of the player's gold to boot).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsBattlefront" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsBattlefront">Star Wars: Battlefront</a> II</em>, you can gain access to certain elite weapons after doing well enough as a certain class overall and then, in the middle of a match, doing enough of a certain action (like getting enough headshots with a sniper rifle) in a single life. In general, these weapons are very useful - the elite pistol is one of the most deadly weapons in the game, for example, and the remote controlled missile is useful for hitting weapon weak points from a distance - but others are not, particularly the laser sniper. While it's supposed to shoot through units into others, this is undermined by the fact that its hit detection is terrible - things that look like direct hits are often not, and this is not helped by the trail of the laser being much wider than the laser itself, making it difficult to tell exactly where you hit. Even body shots are wonky, while headshots are completely out of the question, and in general, it's more effective to hit enemies with headshots one at a time then try your luck with the laser sniper. Worst of all, it only has one level of scope zoom as opposed to two. Unfortunately, snipers can't switch back to the regular sniper after having switched to the elite one - if you do so, you have no choice but to either try your luck or kill yourself and respawn with the regular sniper. Luckily, you don't have to use the elite weapons until you switch to them, meaning you can keep using the regular sniper by merely never switching to the pistol (leaving yourself relatively defenseless if ambushed) after activating the laser sniper.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SystemShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SystemShock">System Shock</a> 2</em> features an Exotic bioweapon made from and reloaded with worms. It has two settings, one of which harms annelids, one of which harms humans, hybrid humans, or any other variation thereof... including you. It does a <em>lot</em> of damage, but that's not much consolation when only two kinds of enemies count as "annelids". As well, worms are extremely rare compared to other ammo, and with a certain implant, piles of worms can be consumed for a considerable amount of health, which is usually far more valuable than throwing them at enemies so long as you have any other weaponry at all... and among the pistol, the shotgun and the grenade launcher, you certainly will.

<ul><li> The Razorback is a Sniper secondary that prevents one backstab (and alerts the Sniper wearing it). The thing is, that's all it does. It protects from one backstab, and then it breaks, forcing you to go back to the Resupply Cabinet at your base for another one or wait 30 seconds for it to recharge. Many Spies simply ignore the Razorback altogether and just shoot the Sniper with their revolver, made easier since the Razorback also negates overhealing. Even worse, the other choices you may have are the trusty SMG (good mid-to-close range <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RangedEmergencyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RangedEmergencyWeapon">Ranged Emergency Weapon</a>), the Cleaner's Carbine (also a decent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyWeapon">Emergency Weapon</a>, which can gain a few seconds of mini-crits on dealing a certain amount of damage), and the super-versatile <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrineTrouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrineTrouble">Jarate</a> that can extinguish burning teammates, reveal a cloaked/disguised Spy, and force any soaked enemies to take mini-critical hits!

The "no overhealing" effect was implemented to at least make the Sniper vulnerable to something.</span>
</li><li> The Cozy Camper stops you from flinching when hit and gives slight (1 per second) health regeneration, but ramps up all damage taken by 20%, effectively lowering the Sniper's max health without outright doing so. Unsurprisingly, the Cozy Camper's downside was eventually removed to make it actually usable.
</li><li> The Classic, an alternate sniper rifle for the Sniper. Its biggest claim to fame is the ability to charge shots without being scoped, which sounds alright... however, the Classic has one downside that absolutely <em>kills</em> its viability: it can only headshot when fully charged. This totally removes the ability to quickly eliminate enemies with a split-second headshot, which works on <em>half the classes in the game</em>, most crucially including enemy Snipers. Add on the fact that the "charge without being scoped" ability is nearly useless unless you're really worried about somebody sneaking up on you from the side or you think inching along hoping somebody appears is a viable tactic, and the Classic is a downgrade only really used by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">memelords</a> or clueless newbies that don't know how it works.

It's not at all uncommon for for a mission reward to be a worse weapon than something you found while completing it.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">Borderlands 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> E-Tech weapons: according to the lore, Hyperion research into Eridium and Eridian tech led to the development of guns that could shoot projectiles other than bullets, which Hyperion then licensed out to the other weapons manufacturers. Their rarity and stats make them competitive to purple-quality weapons on paper, so you'd be forgiven for assuming that they offer a viable alternative to conventional guns. Sure, the extra damage sounds nice, but they consume multiple ammo per shot, and they generally have reduced or no ability to crit, which means you'll end up using more ammo to do less damage in the long run.
</li><li> There are quite a few skills throughout the series that are either ineffective or counterproductive. Gaige gets hit by this the worst: just about every skill that's meant to upgrade the killing power of her pet robot Deathtrap ends up decreasing its DPS in some way.

A not-so-savvy player will be tempted to pick one up as soon as it appears and run recklessly into the fray, only to be startled to find out afterwards that his protection is all gone when the effect wears off, and not just the pentagram's, but also that shiny Red Armor that he jumped through hoops and on pinhead-wide platforms to collect. In a game where even the most basic armor is the difference between living and dying, this can be catastrophic. This is only in the first game: the invulnerability power-ups in all following games cover the user's armor as well.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, at one point Death Knights had a mechanic called Runic Empowerment, that gave their main attacks that cost runic power a chance to instantly recharge one of their depleted runes. At the same time, the Unholy talent tree contained a talent that allowed Death Knights to replace that mechanic with Runic Corruption, that instead caused all of their runes to recharge much faster. Problem is, the talent took two talent points, and if there's only one point in it, the effect is much less useful than the Runic Empowerment it replaced. The advice knowledgeable players gave was that if the Death Knight planned to invest in Runic Corruption, they shouldn't put any points into it until they had the two talent points to max it out immediately.
<ul><li> Unlike most specs, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding">Dual Wielding</a> fury warriors could pick from one of two 'ultimate' talents at the end of their talent tree. One let them simultaneously wield a two-handed weapon in each hand (with two-handed weapons doing more damage than one-handed ones), whilst the other gave a boost to damage when wielding a single-handed weapon in both hands. Even ignoring the badass factor of having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">BFS</a> x 2, the one-handed talent was useless. If in any doubt the player could search online and find that the WoWPedia entry for the 1H talent was blank whilst the entry for the 2H talent consisted of a mathematical proof of why it was better...
</li><li> With the introduction of Glyphs up until their retooling into pure cosmetics, some fell under this, or at least seemed to, depending on how you play the game. In general, any glyph with the word 'but' in the description probably wasn't worth it, since it took up a glyph slot to help and hinder the player in equal measure.
<ul><li> One Glyph that wasn't really subjective about this trope was the Monk's Glyph of Uplift, which replaced the Chi cost of one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">Mistweaver Monk's</a> main multi-target heals with a (kinda steep) Mana cost. Players generally agreed that there was absolutely <em>no</em> situation in which you want to do this. Perhaps for that reason, the glyph was removed in patch 5.4.
</li></ul></li><li> The Artifact-quality fishing rod introduced in the <em>Legion</em> expansion suffered from this. Unlike all the other Artifact <em>weapons</em> you picked up, the "Deeplight Angler" lacked <em>any</em> Artifact Power, meaning that the first ability upgrade you got wasn't free. To gain Artifact Power, you needed to fish up <em>more</em> of the rare fish you used to unlock the Angler. However, the rare fish could only be acquired from "schools of fish", which were consumed once a certain number of fish were caught, and several mandatory-if-you-want-the-great-powers upgrade nodes would grant you the "power" to fish up an entire school in one cast. The problem? Catching the rare fish is pure RNG, and by getting the entire school at once you were <em>reducing</em> your chances of catching the same rare fish you needed to get more Artifact Power and get the preferred perks.

The purpose of Invention is to build gizmos that add "perks" to your equipment. The perks are randomly generated from a list according to the materials you use, so they're highly likely, even if you use the right materials, to end up not giving the perks you wanted for your equipment, especially if your Invention skill level is low. Worse, some perks are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonMushroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonMushroom">deliberately bad</a>. And for a long time, the only way to remove gizmos from your equipment was to <em>destroy the equipment</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline">Ragnarok Online</a></em> have many equipments that on a glance should be better than others, but in reality they're not.
<ul><li> A rather popular example of this is the headgear Model Training Hat. It requires the headgear Apple of Archer and the weapon Book[3] to make, Book[3] itself is a rare drop from a teleport-happy Guild Dungeon only monster. What you get after making it, is a headgear that's......worse than Apple of Archer. Apple of Archer has no defense, but has DEX + 3 effect. Model Training Hat gives only DEX + 2. Sure, Model Training Hat has 2 defense point, but it's really not worth the effort to make, considering how more useful the additional 1 point of DEX is on Apple of Archer, compared to the additional defense on Model Training Hat, not to mention the effort it takes to get Book[3].
</li><li> Some colored headgears can be made by combining the original headgear with color dye. The issue here, is that not only do color dyes take a bit of effort to obtain, what you get is also not better than the original headgear - the difference is literally just the color. You're spending all that time literally for a palette swap to make your character looks prettier.
</li><li> Up until the change on how weapon ATK and character's natural ATK works in relation to card effect bonus, it's always better to use a low ATK low level weapon with many card slot, than a powerful weapon with only one, or two (or even none at all) card slot. This results in many low ATK low level weapons, at that time, become more highly sought after than powerful but only one/no slot weapons dropped by strong monsters and bosses.

</li><li> Some of the subweapons in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em> games fall into this trope.
<ul><li> In almost every game, the throwing knife. It can be thrown faster than most of the other subweapons (and, in some cases, in clusters of three), but it does less damage than your whip, and in later games armored enemies are immune to it. They like to stash these in candles just before a boss encounter, so you'll be stuck with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonMushroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonMushroom">weakest weapon</a> in the game before your fight.
<ul><li> Later games <em>do</em> give the knife a powerful Item Crash called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">"Thousand Knives"</a> that proves to be quite effective against most enemies. The only problem is that it keeps you stuck in one position while you're doing it, it takes a long time to finish, and you can't cancel out of it, so using it at the wrong moment can be deadly.
</li><li> The knife can be useful early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a></em>. At low levels, hearts are something of a precious commodity, and attacking at range is very useful given your weak starter sword. Also, an early almost-boss foe is very weak to all subweapons. On top of that, the Knife's one-heart cost and rate of fire means you can spam it like there's no tomorrow, an effect not dissimilar to firing a machine gun (every other knife in the series either has a slow rate of fire or heart/MP cost that stops you from doing this for too long). It's the exception to the rule, really.

</li><li> Once you unlock the Shooter job class in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaCircleOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaCircleOfTheMoon">Castlevania: Circle of the Moon</a></em>, you can make daggers home in on enemies, which can actually be pretty handy. The Shooter also does more damage with daggers than the other job classes (but they still aren't as powerful as your whip).
</li></ul></li><li> The original style games have an occasional Cross, which kills almost every enemy on screen. But it's always placed where there are only a few enemies, which you can easily handle without it.
</li><li> The axe subweapon is disappointingly situational. It does great damage, but has such a high arc that most enemies will simply walk under it, which makes it completely useless at anything less than extreme range or against flying enemies (which it's <em>fantastic</em> against).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaRondoOfBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaRondoOfBlood">Castlevania: Rondo of Blood</a></em>, to compensate for her many advantages, Maria has several absolutely worthless secondary weapons. She has the music book, which is like the throwing knife but lacks even a useful Item Crash, and a weapon that sends two birds diagonally upwards, which is totally useless except in certain rare circumstances (although at least <em>it</em> has a useful Item Crash).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaOrderOfEcclesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaOrderOfEcclesia">Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia</a></em> features the Volaticus glyph, which is an awesome glyph that allows you to fly freely around the screen. So why is it a letdown? It's gained so late in the game that you barely get to <em>use</em> it unless you do the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a> Large Cavern. It does make Dracula much easier, though, since he's programmed to use an easily-dodged flame pillar attack over any of his other ones if you use it against him. It also allows you to fire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Nitesco beams</a> while moving, even backwards if you fired before moving.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin">Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin</a></em>'s Owl Morph has a similar issue. Again, it's good in and itself, but not long after you get it, you find the Griffon Wing, which is a super jump that outclasses the Owl Morph in every way. You'll use the morph 3 or 4 times at most.
</li><li> In fact, many of the upgrades in the DS Castlevania games are only useful in two or three areas, or are quickly outclassed by another upgrade.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Sequelitis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Sequelitis">Sequelitis</a></em> argued that most of the weapons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperCastlevaniaIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperCastlevaniaIV">Super Castlevania IV</a></em> are this, because the whip is so heavily buffed that it's more effective than the majority of them. Why use the knife when the whip already reaches most of the way across the screen? Why use the axe when the whip can already reach airborne enemies? Why use the holy water when the whip can stunlock enemies?
</li><li> In <em>Aria of Sorrow</em>, the Killer Fish soul enables you to summon a fish which attacks enemies in your path. If you're not underwater, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">the fish just dies</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">The soul description does mention this side effect</a>.
</li><li> In <em>Dawn of Sorrow</em>, one of the bosses you face can copy the soul powers that Soma uses. So you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">deliberately equip a weak soul for him to copy</a>.

I don't think it's working" (the Super Charged Body Slam). What this "upgrade" to your body slam does is increase the range of its shock wave by around one box width, but this is something that will be useful in the game exactly <em>one time</em>, the bonus stage of Dino Might, and in a scenario tailor-made to specifically require it. You'll otherwise forget you even have it (it's rather telling that said bonus stage has an icon in the background <em>reminding you the power-up even exists</em>), and it's such a non-upgrade that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">N. Sane Trilogy</a> just up and lets you start the game with it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/CrashBandicootTheWrathOfCortex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/CrashBandicootTheWrathOfCortex">Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex</a></em> introduces walking on tips as a skill awarded for beating the first boss. This allows you to walk on suspended Nitro Crates which otherwise blow on contact. However, the main paths in levels never ever require you to use this and for gem paths/death routes it is just simpler to wait until you can use Double Jump + Death Tornado Spin combo to glide over the boxes, so many players will fully complete the game without using this power even once beyond plain curiosity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthwormJim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthwormJim">Earthworm Jim</a> 2</em> features the Bubble Gun, which shoots harmless bubbles <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note42ull');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note42ull" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note42ull');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Bubble Gun is often an outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonMushroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonMushroom">Poison Mushroom</a> — sitting in places where you needed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">More Dakka</a> and have to avoid picking it up.</span>, and the Barn Blaster, which kills everything on screen - as long as you're not hit during the five seconds you spend immobile trying to fire the damn thing. Not to mention that you probably won't have a chance to use the good stuff either - you can only actually use your guns in about half the stages in the game, and you lose them all if you die in any stage. The bubble gun is worse on the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive, which doesn't have the button to switch weapons (at least not on the common 3-button controller).
</li><li> In <em>Flimbo's Quest</em>, the Superscroll. The point is to replace all the scrolls required for a level and send you straight through to the next level. However, it costs 2500, a scroll costs 400, and the most scrolls you ever need for a single level is 6!
</li><li> The axe in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostsNGoblins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostsNGoblins">Ghosts 'n Goblins</a></em> is extremely awkward to use and isn't any more powerful than the other weapons. It passes through enemies on impact, which is a terrible thing because all it does is leave you defenseless against an oncoming monster. The biggest kick to the balls is in the NES version: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">one of the bosses is immune to it</a>. Its only redeeming feature is that it's rare. The torch has a shorter range (especially in the later games), isn't any stronger than the other weapons, and if it touches the ground, it will stand there and burn the ground, which is useful if enemies accidentally run into it, but it also still counts as a bullet on screen, messing up with the weapon capping and leaving you defenseless against the other enemies.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby">Kirby</a></em> games have several examples:
<ul><li> Mixing Fire and Ice abilities in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kirby64TheCrystalShards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kirby64TheCrystalShards">Kirby 64</a></em> causes Kirby to turn into an ice cube... and melt. Yay? However, it might just be the developers poking fun at the player. Would you try to mix ice and fire?
</li><li> The rock/bomb combo is a pack of TNT that hits everything on the screen — including you, if you're not standing still and holding down to put on a hardhat. The TNT goes off if anything other than you touches it, and you can only drop it nearby. For <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>, one of the later levels requires you to pick up this combo early on and traverse most of the level with it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">including a sequence of tiny platforms with blobs spawning from the ceiling that will knock the power out of you into a bottomless pit</a>.
</li><li> Also, the Sleep ability in all the platformers. You sleep... and that's it. Upon waking up, you revert to normal Kirby. Sometimes you can restore HP, but usually only in the games with Scrolls, and at all other times Sleep is an outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonMushroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonMushroom">Poison Mushroom</a>.
</li><li> Depending on the game, Tornado Kirby and Hi-Jump Kirby can either be useless or absolute <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game Breakers</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">Ball Kirby is incredible if used correctly, but the controls are a little fumbly</a>.
</li><li> The Mini ability from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyAndTheAmazingMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyAndTheAmazingMirror">Kirby &amp; the Amazing Mirror</a></em>. It's used only to squeak through tiny passageways and only appears where it's needed, but as long as you have the ability you have no means of defending yourself without having to discard the ability.
</li><li> Circus Kirby is probably the worst of the new powers introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyTripleDeluxe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyTripleDeluxe">Kirby: Triple Deluxe</a></em>, as most of its attacks<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5hzb6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5hzb6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5hzb6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> the exception being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleJump">Acrobatics</a></span> either won't hit anything unless it's right next to Kirby or send Kirby bouncing around wildly and into potentially dangerous situations.
</li><li> Rick the Hamster's usefulness as an animal friend basically translates to "six extra hits at the cost of losing your ability to fly" in a game where health and extra lives are plentiful and you're more likely to die from falling down a cliff than from taking hits. While all the other animal friends have flashy abilities like <em>vastly</em> improved flight and swimming or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleJump">Double Jump</a>, Rick's only real claim to fame is his traction on ice, but even that only makes him marginally useful in one world of each game, where slipping off a ledge is of little consequence to begin with due to Kirby's aforementioned ability to fly. It's worse in <em>Dreamland 3</em> where, for some inane reason, Rick was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">Nerfed</a> even further<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6quf2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6quf2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6quf2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">animal friends no longer give extra health and he's lost his inhale ability (he has to run and grab them in his mouth instead)</span> while the others, at least, get improvements <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7ifez');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7ifez" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7ifez');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Kine moves much better on land, for example</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MasterOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MasterOfDarkness">Master of Darkness</a></em>, the dagger is the main melee weapon you start out with, and can only do one point of damage. Stronger melee weapons in the game can do more damage points<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note84kax');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note84kax" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note84kax');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">sabers do two, but have the longest reach, stakes do three, and axes do four, but have a shorter reach than sabers and stakes</span>, so if you have one in your inventory and collect the dagger, you're back to using it until you can find another stronger melee weapon.
</li><li> Most of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em> games have at least one utterly unimpressive weapon, to the point it's become a series staple for said unimpressive weapon to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">very effective against the final boss</a>.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan1">Mega Man</a></em>: Bombman's Hyper Bomb is extremely powerful, but the fuse is so long that the enemy will often move out of range before it can go off. Also, you can only throw one bomb at a time, so you're left wide open for a long time if you miss. Still, it is useful in situations where there is an enemy directly above or below you, and is stationary (Sniper Joes that can't see you, for example, or turrets).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan2">Mega Man 2</a></em>: Flash Man's Time Stopper drains energy rapidly, and there's no way to turn it off or even switch to another weapon until it times out. It does not damage enemies, and it disables your gun, so you can't even shoot while the foe is stunned. It's only really useful in Wood Man's stage and against Quick Man himself (who does take damage from it, but even then the full energy bar will only take about half his health). Theoretically it's useful in the Laser Gates section at the start of Quick Man's level, but unless you can find energy capsules to recharge it with, using it there means not using it against Quick Man himself.
<ul><li> Atomic Fire as well. Sure, it is very powerful when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargedAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargedAttack">fully charged</a>, but charging it takes forever AND you will most likely get hit while charging it, losing the charge. At least Atomic Fire can destroy things.
</li><li> The Leaf Shield doesn't block projectiles, chews up energy quickly, and most irritatingly, hurtles off if you try to move. Aside from boss weaknesses (and even though it kills Air Man quickly, his tornados have a habit of blocking it), its only real use is to farm weapon energy in certain areas.
</li></ul></li><li> The Game Boy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManII">Mega Man II</a></em> has the jackhammer Sakugarne. Using it will damage you more than the enemies. AND it's the only weapon other than the Mega Buster that damages the final boss.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan3">Mega Man 3</a></em> has a couple, thanks to Capcom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">rushing the game out to capitalize on the success of Mega Man 2</a>.
<ul><li> Top Man's Top Spin is often associated with this trope because it's an all-or-nothing weapon; either it will destroy an enemy in one hit, or it will do nothing, causing you injury, and furthermore will drain weapon energy if you try to attack again while your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility">flickering sprite</a> overlaps with the enemy's. This makes it frustratingly cumbersome when used against Shadow Man, the only enemy who's weak to it but doesn't die to it in one hit. Because he gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility">Mercy Invincibility</a> just like you, he's alternately vulnerable and immune to it.
</li><li> At least Top Spin can actually destroy things though (including the final boss), while Spark Man's Spark Shock is beyond useless. It fires a spark that turns into a sort of electric cloud on contact, and anything in the cloud is stunned via electrocution. But the stunned enemies can still inflict collision damage on you, you can't switch to another weapon to finish them off, and if the screen is swarming with enemies, they'll push each other in and out of the cloud, making things even more chaotic.
</li><li> While Rush Jet and Rush Coil are legitimately great (Rush Jet bordering on broken), Rush Marine is generally seen as irrelevant. This is because it can only be used in water, and there's really only one section of the game (a bit in Gemini Man's stage) where there's enough water for it to be put to good use. And even in that instance, Rush Jet would still do its job about as well. It can also be used against the Kamegoro Maker, but that boss is already one of the easiest ones in the game, and hitting it with Shadow Blades is a much more efficient way to handle it. <em>Mega Man 4</em> made it <em>slightly</em> better by nerfing Rush Jet and adding more significant water sections in Dive Man's stage, but even that wasn't enough to save it, as it was removed in <em>5</em> and never returned.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan4">Mega Man 4</a></em> has the Skull Barrier. One hit will destroy it, and although Dive Man is weak to it, using it against him only makes the battle <em>harder!</em> Its only strong point is being fairly cheap.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan5">Mega Man 5</a></em> has probably the largest collection of poor subweapons in the series:
<ul><li> Gravity Hold: Hits the whole screen for only a single buster shot's worth of damage, consumes a lot of energy per shot, and enemies defeated by it are thrown off the screen instead of destroyed, so they will never drop any energy pickups or 1-Ups.
</li><li> Napalm Bomb: Bounces slowly along the ground, ricochets off walls, and has a deceptively short blast radius when it goes off.
</li><li> Water Wave: A second ground-based weapon that's worse than the Napalm Bomb. It's noticeably faster, but does only as much damage as an uncharged buster shot, is stopped by walls, and can't even be fired in midair. Oh, and it's the weakness of Star Man, who spends most of the fight jumping around, making it uncommonly ineffective.
</li><li> Star Crash: The third in a series of useless shields. The star shield it creates can sustain only one hit and it inexplicably uses less weapon energy when fired as a projectile instead of when used like the shield it's supposed to be. It also seems to have unusually large range, making it prone to taking hits that would have missed you anyway.
</li><li> Power Stone: Causes three rocks to quickly spiral away from your position. Due to being nigh impossible to aim anywhere, it's best used against enemies that are about to collide with you. Since it can inflict up to three hits in quick succession, it ironically makes a better assault shield than the Star Crash.
</li><li> Charge Kick: Turns your slide into a kick, during which you are invincible, but besides being yet another ground-based weapon in a game that only needs one at most, you're more liable to throw yourself at enemies instead of attack them if you don't know the exact range of your slide. Wave Man, the boss weak to it, also likes calling up water walls that stop it in its tracks. It's probably most comparable to the Top Spin from Mega Man 3; deadly when mastered, but why bother in the first place?
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan6">Mega Man 6</a></em> has the Plant Barrier. Yet another shield weapon that doesn't do much. It's a carbon copy of the Skull Barrier. Any projectile instantly destroys it and it consumes a lot of weapon energy. Unlike the Leaf Shield and the Star Crash, it cannot be thrown.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan8">Mega Man 8</a></em> has the Water Balloon earned from Aqua Man, for not having any uses outside of just being tossed at enemies. Every other weapon in the game has a secondary use<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note994yx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note994yx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note994yx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Mega Ball can make you jump higher, Flash Bomb illuminates areas, Thunder Claw can swing on hooks, Tornado Hold can reach high areas, and Flame Sword can burn bushes</span> or at least can do things your buster can't<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10qjhq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10qjhq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10qjhq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Astro Crush inflicts heavy damage to all enemies on screen, Homing Sniper homes in and can be charged for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">Macross Missile Massacre</a>, and Ice Wave can freeze enemies</span>, while Water Balloon is just a generic weapon and not even a particularly useful one at that. On top of that, <em>8</em> is also the only game in the series that lacks dedicated weapon weaknesses for normal enemies, so there's no point of using it on anything but one or two bosses. To make matters worse while it is coded to be the weapon of choice against Dr. Wily (following the series habit of making the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> vulnerable to the most lackluster weapon), the Flash Bomb's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> is far more effective because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">Death of a Thousand Cuts</a> the lingering explosions inflict on the largely immobile enemy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan10">Mega Man 10</a></em> has two letdown weapons:
<ul><li> Commando Bomb: Fires a single flying missile whose direction can be changed in mid-flight twice, but it consumes a good amount of energy and the missile is as powerful as a single Buster pellet. Actually hitting enemies with the bomb isn't wise; you actually have to hit it with the explosive shockwave to do better damage.
</li><li> Thunder Wool: A little thundercloud slowly floats up before dropping a lightning bolt, but like the Commando Bomb, the cloud is incredibly weak and can be stopped by any enemy or projectile, and the delay when it drops the lightning bolt makes it tough and unwieldy to actually hit things with. It also consumes a lot of energy for being so clunky.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegamanX3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegamanX3">Megaman X 3</a></em>: The Buster upgrade is strong but has an ungodly charge time and it stops you when you shot it at any charge level higher than the standard. It may not seem as much in theory, but it stops EVERYTHING you're doing. If you're holding onto a wall you will fall, if you're trying to get away from an enemy you will stop dead in your tracks and more than likely take damage, and it even ignores inertia as you will stop even if you shot while jumping. Worst of all, it's a spread shot, meaning you need to hit your enemy with most of it in order to do more damage, and that means getting dangerously close. Against enemies that have a tiny weak spot and the rest of their body clad in armor, it makes just a bit more of damage than a 3-level charged Buster. Really, you're better off just charging to the 3-level and ignore the other 3 charge levels, as 2 concentrated level 3-shots make more damage than a 6-level Charge Shot while also not gimping your mobility. The only reason people get it is to enable the Gold armor and getting Zero's saber.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX5">Mega Man X5</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Skiver's attack for Zero. The problem with it is how it's performed: attack while dashing. While this is well and good on its own, the problem arises in that it completely breaks a technique that is executed in a similar way (constantly attacking and dashing in place) that lets Zero do obscene damage to anything in front of him. It makes it worse than a letdown, to the point that it's an outright hindrance. Fortunately, you can potentially go without it by simply firing off the Shuttle without beating The Skiver, provided it works.
</li><li> X can wear three different armors in this game. The starting Fourth Armor is highly useful and will get you through most of the game. The Falcon Armor, obtained by collecting scattered pieces of it, is generally seen as a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> for enabling a ridiculously effective "invincible flight" option. And then there's the similarly-obtained Gaea Armor. The intent with it is to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> option, increasing X's durability, letting him cling to walls, and allowing him to walk on spikes, but these two advantages are horribly overbalanced: X isn't just slower, he also can't use special weapons, nor can he airdash at all, nor can he use Parts to upgrade his stats. The result is bad offense, bad mobility, and an overall boring playstyle with few meaningful advantages; the Falcon Armor's flight alone does more to improve X's survivability than anything the Gaea Armor does. Its only use is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless">getting certain upgrades</a> stuck on the other side of massive areas filled with spikes or behind giant blocks that can only be broken with the Gaea Armor's special moves, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman">seemingly only exist</a> to force you to use the Gaea Armor if you want to 100% the game.

You will repeatedly kill yourself trying to attack enemies and grab ropes in the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell">Platform Hell</a> sections if you're foolish enough to get this. The only saving grace is that you can unlock the end game without defeating Scaravich. For added insult to injury, it turns out this technique, if you're using Zero, is Sigma's weakness after going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a>.
</li><li> In both <em>X5</em> and <em>X6</em>, extra lives become this. Normally you're forced to restart the level from the beginning if you run out of lives, but these two games let you continue from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> right from the last checkpoint, making extra lives pointless at absolute best. These games throw extra lives at you like candy, since rescuing the <em>very</em> plentiful injured reploids grants extra lives as rewards, and since your only means to escape an unfinished level is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a>, the surplus of lives does more harm than good.
</li><li> Oil Man's Oil Slider in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManPoweredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManPoweredUp">Mega Man Powered Up</a></em> is practically impossible to hit an enemy with without taking damage yourself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Mega Man Xtreme 2</a></em> has a borderline example: Each part of X's armor permanently takes up a slot that would otherwise be used to equip a different item. For most of the parts, that's fine, but the Head Part is only good for getting the Arm Part, and you can just complete that part of the task as Zero instead. You essentially make yourself weaker by getting it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends">Mega Man Legends</a></em>:
<ul><li> Late in the game you'll finally get your hands on the Shield Arm to defend yourself from enemy attacks, only to find that it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessItem">can't seem to defend against jack-shit</a>. It turns out all it can block are weak projectiles used by enemies way back at the beginning of the game, and these stopped being a threat to you a long time ago. Making matters worse is even if this wasn't the case and the shield could block anything, it takes up your only secondary weapon slot and you would <em>still</em> be better off taking another weapon instead of a shield. The worst part is you make this from the Marlwolf Shell, an item acquired from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss">a fairly difficult boss</a>, and the Mystic Orb, an item acquired by completing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSideQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSideQuest">the annoying Balloon Fantasy minigame</a>: your reward for accomplishing these is a <em>useless item</em>.
</li><li> A little way into the game you get Mega Man's iconic helmet... and it <em>actually weakens you</em>. It does increase your defense a bit, but it also makes it very hard to be knocked down. The problem is that Mega Man is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility">completely invincible once sent reeling and until he gets back up</a>. Putting on the helmet just turns one attack that does some damage into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">a lot of attacks that do a lot of damage overall</a> and trap you in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfHurting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfHurting">Cycle of Hurting</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2">Sonic Adventure 2</a></em> has several character upgrades which are completely useless to most of the gameplay and are only useful in particularly niche situations.
<ul><li> Sonic's Magic Hands, which allow him to turn one of his enemies into a held item, which he can then throw at another enemy - but to use it, you have to scroll through an action menu, and thus you can only use it while standing completely still and only on an enemy that isn't actively attacking you. Plus, it's impossible to aim the throw, which doesn't even have much range or do much damage. The default homing attack is superior in every way. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11vsl7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11vsl7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11vsl7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It is actually useful on Point Runs. Magic Hands doubles the points earned from the enemy it's used on. Since points determine your Rank at the end of the level, using Magic Hands on high-point-value enemies (like Gold Beetles) is useful for getting A-Ranks on hard levels. It is good for insta-killing enemies with shields too, as they can block neither the Hands nor their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrievousHarmWithABody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrievousHarmWithABody">thrown partner</a>.</span>
</li><li> Another Power-Up Letdown is the Mystic Melody, which each character can collect. It's extremely hard to find, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">isn't ever mentioned or even hinted at</a>, and can only be used for either completing a mission to earn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>, finding shortcuts/power ups, or finding the missing Chao in the respective missions.
</li><li> Knuckles' Sunglasses provide no useful function, just let you see and collect certain hidden items. They don't even come in handy in a specific situation (Sonic can use his Magic Hands to make exactly one enemy easier to overcome in Cannon's Core). However <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShades">they do look cool</a> and that must <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">count for something</a>. Rouge also has a similar item she can equip (the Treasure Scope).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a></em> has the Bubble Shield, which is a total waste of time from Mushroom Hill Zone on if you're playing the game with <em>Sonic &amp; Knuckles</em> locked on. After Launch Base Zone, there's no more water in any of the future levels, so the Bubble Shield is never needed unless you want it to make you bounce higher (Sonic only). This gets worse if you are playing <em>Sonic &amp; Knuckles</em> as a stand-alone, which has no water <em>at all</em>. It's still good for protection from ring loss for one hit, which is better than no shield at all, even if its beneficial function (being able to breath underwater) is useless.
<ul><li> The Speed Shoes throughout most of the games tend to be useful when you got a long stretch of ground and loops to run through, but if you get the item before a set of platforms you have to jump around on, the item then loses its usefulness.
</li><li> Hyper Sonic &amp; Hyper Knuckles are this to some because they're a lot harder to control, they're a lot more susceptible to crushers that suddenly come from offscreen, and they sometimes die when they touch something that's not even lethal due to rushed collision detection.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64">Super Mario 64</a></em> has a few examples:
<ul><li> First is the Wing Cap. It supposedly allows Mario to fly, but it turns out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteFlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteFlight">Not Quite Flight</a> and more like gliding instead. But even then, the physics are questionable at best.
</li><li> Next is the Shell Board, which allows Mario to skate, but its duration is far too short for it to be useful, especially underwater.
</li><li> Last and most infamously is your reward for 100% completion: a cameo by Yoshi, who gives you 100 lives and a sparkly new triple-jump, then leaves forever. Not only are lives already an obsolete aspect of this game<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note123dgu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note123dgu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note123dgu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">You have the option to save your progress after every star and key; reaching Game Over does nothing but make you start outside the castle.</span>, but you've already seen and done everything there is to see and do. Even if you went back and redid the old puzzles, it's unlikely that you'll die often if at all since you would have mastered all the steps by that point. Oh, and the new triple jump only reaches about half the height of the old one.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em> has a few.
<ul><li> The Anchor. Each world besides 8 has a super secret Mushroom House unlocked by collecting enough coins in a specific level. Around half of these contain P-Wings, which are among the most powerful items in the game. The other half contain anchors, which are not. Using an anchor stops the airship in each world from moving around if you fail to beat it. This is useless, because the airship only appears after you have cleared a path through most of the world getting to the castle in the first place, and doesn't appear at all if you beat the castle on the first try. Its only real use is in World 5, so you don't have to go back and forth from the sky and the ground. There's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">Game-Breaking Glitch</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem">NES</a> version that can make the airship fly off the World 5 map completely, making the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake">Unwinnable</a>. The Anchor prevents this from happening.
</li><li> The Music Box puts the wandering Hammer Brothers on the map to sleep for two "turns". The wandering Hammer Brothers are fairly easy to defeat and you always get a power-up for doing so, so this is pretty pointless. Though it can be useful to skip a mandatory Piranha Plant-filled mini-level in Pipe Land. (All you get is a Mushroom in the second Piranha Plant level.)
</li><li> The Frog Suit makes traversing water levels easier, but on land, it hops as opposed to walking, which makes it much more difficult to control and prevents Mario from building up running momentum. The only way to circumvent this is by carrying an object, but nothing in the game can be carried indefinitely. Worse than that, though, is that it's impossible to crouch while wearing the Frog Suit, meaning if you encounter a low obstacle that requires you to duck and slide underneath, you're pretty well hosed if you can't find a way to lose it.
</li><li> The Fire Flower can be this in some levels. Although it's quite useful for taking out enemies, many bonuses are only available through using the block smashing, flying, and gliding abilities of the Leaf power-up. Usually the level design is generous enough to have a Leaf near any major bonuses, though.
</li></ul></li><li> The Dragon Cap from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioLandSuperMarioLand3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioLandSuperMarioLand3">Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3</a></em> has an awkwardly long delay when firing up and dying off, short range, and simply lacks the utility abilities like the Bull Cap's ground pound and the Jet Cap's increased speed, jump height, and flight. Adding to this, is flaming enemies destroys them without awarding coins... in a game where coins are used in bonus games, you need coins to finish levels, and your total coins at the end determines your ending. It becomes evident in the game that even the developers must have realized this, as the Dragon Cap becomes increasingly rare as the game goes on and often only appears where it's required to solve a puzzle or bypass an obstacle immune to your other attacks, and you <em>always</em> find a powerup to get rid of it not long after.
</li><li> The good old Fire Flower is this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em>, mostly because too many enemies in Dinosaur Land are strangely unaffected by fireballs (Like the Dino Rhinos and Sumo Brothers), and the game-breaking Cape Feather does everything the Fire Flower does just as effectively and more efficiently. At least you get coins for killing things with it, though. Meanwhile, the Super Mushroom is usually pretty helpful, but it becomes another obstacle to avoid if you happen to have a more useful power-up in reserve, as the game will still keep giving them to you even in Super form and they'll replace whatever else you were carrying.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBros">New Super Mario Bros.</a></em>
<ul><li> The Mega Mushroom makes you <em>huge</em> and lets you stampede through the level without fear of losing a life — except that as you go, you break pipes in half. Nine times out of ten you screw yourself out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a> that way. (At least the levels are replayable...) That is, when you don't die anyway because the level terrain is weak enough that your hulked-out protagonist literally <em>breaks through the floor</em>. If you can manage to get one into a boss fight, though, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">you have a one-hit kill</a>... Unless it's Bowser Jr., who will just bounce off you until you revert.
</li><li> The Mini Mushroom makes you tiny, which is good in that it allows you to enter areas that are otherwise inaccessible, increases your jump height and makes your jumps floatier and allows you to run on water... but it also slows you down considerably and makes it harder to stomp enemies (requiring a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundPound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundPound">Ground Pound</a> to hurt most of them). It also reduces you to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a>, so if you were Fire Mario, picking this up is actually <em>worse</em> than touching an enemy. And if you want to get every bonus, you'll need to go some relatively long distances with the handicap in place. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Have fun.</a>
<ul><li> In order to get to each of the two hidden worlds, you are required to beat a boss with the Mini Mushroom power-up. One of them likes to hide in the ground and disappear before you can ground pound him, and the other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">flies.</a> This can be cheesed around a bit by keeping a Mini Mushroom in reserve and fighting the boss normally until it's one hit away from defeat, so you need only deliver one hit while tiny.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a></em> has Spring Mario, which can jump really high but is a nightmare to control. It gets you both ways — the Spring is a requirement to reach certain areas, as well as to fight a boss that fires sorta-homing projectiles at you. But once you have it, you're stuck with it until you get hit. So, after being required to use it, if you want to precisely navigate some narrow platforms, you'll need to find an enemy to run into first!
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Valis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Valis">Valis</a> III</em>, the Heroine, Yuko, has her sword's power "fully released" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderAndWiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderAndWiser">Older and Wiser</a> Nazetti <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> with the implication that it will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade">kill her</a></span>. This has no in-game benefit; all it does is give her a fancy new set of armor. (This is possibly to preserve game balance with the other two characters.) This does not stop the difficulty from jumping up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a>, though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xargon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xargon">Xargon</a>: Beyond Reality</em> has the hero start with a laser beam weapon. One of the upgrades to this is <em>throwing rocks</em>, and once you pick up the rock "powerup" you can no longer fire your laser. Fortunately, it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack">resets at the start of each level</a>. Also, if you've grabbed enough gems by the time you get the stupid rock, you can buy back your laser right away.
</li><li> Both the earthquake staff and sundial spells in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProblemWithLicensedGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProblemWithLicensedGames">movie video game</a> <em>Warlock</em> are equally useless; the former causes an essentially non-damaging earthquake that's only good for bringing down rock platforms or float crystals, and is really only mandatory for one level. The latter has two uses: used as a normal spell, you get transported back to the spot you collected it in the level, allowing you to keep all the items you gathered up til then, while resetting all the items and enemies you encountered in the level before the sundial's use. Or, if you die while you have it in your inventory, it acts as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneUp">1-Up</a>, letting you restart the level with all your items replaced by a single full regeneration spell. Since the game has a password system, the latter use is, well, useless, and the game is sufficiently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> that it's more prudent to rush through the game rather than attempt to stock up on every level.
</li><li> The Creepy Crag level in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Plok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Plok">Plok</a></em> has a snazzy looking cowboy outfit complete with a revolver you can get as a powerup. It does absolutely nothing but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BangFlagGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BangFlagGun">shoot out a flag with "BANG" written on it</a>, and seems to exist only to regenerate Plok's limbs.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory">Cave Story</a></em>, enemies drop experience crystals that power up your weapons when you collect them and power down when you get hit, with three levels per weapon. Generally, you want to keep your weapons at the highest level possible, but with the Blade weapon you want to keep it at level 2. The Blade is a highly damaging weapon, but you can only have one shot of it onscreen at a time. The problem with the weapon's level 3 upgrade is that it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPolykill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPolykill">passes through enemies</a>, meaning that you have to wait for the shot to disappear before you can fire another. At level 2, the shot disappears after hitting an enemy, so you can fire as fast as you can press the fire button, more than making up for level 3's increased damage.
<ul><li> There's also the Nemesis, a weapon you can get by trading away the Blade in a sidequest. Unlike all other weapons in the game, it gets <em>weaker</em> as you collect experience, going from a massive piercing bolt of lightning down to a near-harmless rubber duck. And it only takes one of those dozens of experience crystals you'll be generating to level it up...
</li></ul></li><li> The Boots of Lava Walk and the Cloak of Darkness in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WizardsAndWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WizardsAndWarriors">Wizards and Warriors</a></em>. All the former does is let you ride a spout of flames in level 3 (useful for saving you about 2HP in the entire game), and the latter turns you invisible, but due to a glitch, enemies can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllSeeingAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllSeeingAI">still see you just fine</a>.
</li><li> The now-defunct Flash game <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4SFtIayovY">Metroid: Elements<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> has the Space Jump, which, in the actual <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em> games, is a big help, giving you a massive boost to your jumping ability. However, <em>Elements</em> doesn't let you control the height of your jump, leading to Samus always jumping the maximum distance and overshooting platforms, exacerbating the game's floaty and slippery controls.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSuperMode">Ornate Armor</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShovelKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShovelKnight">Shovel Knight</a>. The game puts it best:
<div class="indent"><strong>Tagline</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Flashy! Acrobatic! Useless!</a>

However, you have no control over Chester when he plays it, so you have to wait until he finishes playing it to control him again. This is particularly frustrating in Gator Alley, wherein the guitar power-up shows up as you ride the hippo across the water. Collecting the guitar causes Chester to fall into the water and die, so you have to duck under the guitar to avoid getting it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPitfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPitfall">Super Pitfall</a></em>'s gold ingots. They're the only powerup in the game that isn't hidden in any way, and they even flash bright yellow to draw your eyes... and they're also completely worthless. They provide no intrinsic benefit and there's no shop for you to trade the gold or anything like that, so the only thing they do is give you points. And <em>Super Pitfall</em> is not a game where most players ever care about high score.

They were discontinued in June 2013, but you can still use them if you bought them.
<ul><li> The $17 Charm of Lives increases your maximum number of lives from 5 to 8, but regaining a single life still takes 30 minutes. There are some easier ways to get lives, and if you're using them, you don't need a Charm of Lives to save up 8 lives at a time.
</li><li> The $40 Charm of Stripes lets you paint stripes on any candy once per game. This can be pretty useful at times, but many difficult levels have designs and/or requirements that render it too weak — it won't do much good if you for instance have to collect 30 striped candies or make a wrapped candy/colorbomb combo.
</li><li> The $25 Charm of Frozen Time makes the timer stop while you're pondering in timed levels. Timed levels aren't that common in the first place, and the charm does nothing to protect you from bombs, which like to annoy you in timed levels. To make matters worse, timed levels were eventually removed completely from the HTML5 version of the game.

</li><li> In all <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wipeout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wipeout">Wipeout</a></em> games, you pick up weapons by flying over a weapons pad. Usually you simply have access to all weapons, but in <em>Wipeout Fusion</em> you unlock weapons as you go. However, the enemies get them as well when you do. Really all you ever want is shields, turbos, missiles (all available at the start) and quakes (unlocked after beating one race). However, as you beat more championships, more weapons are added... all of them either bad ones that dilute the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops">weapon selection</a> (autopilot, mines, flamer, rockets) or ones that are amazingly good but far more likely to be used against you (gravity-bomb). Worst of all, unlocking your team's superweapon gives everyone else on the track their super-weapon as well, which is just great when you're flying a Van Über whose super is a useless slow straight line projectile and end up unlocking your EG-R opponents' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeeBeeGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeeBeeGun">swarm weapon</a> that removes half of your health and is completely inescapable.
<ul><li> The actual weapon powerups in the first <em>Wipeout</em> game, in particular the shield. There is a reason why the second game adds a "drop weapon" key and ensures you can't get the same powerup <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">several times</a> in a row, and why later titles <em>do</em> allow you to shoot <em>out</em> of your own shield. The first game doesn't even have a health bar and weapons are highly ineffective on the player, so you're involuntarily giving up the ability to shoot in exchange for immunity from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy">occasional</a> enemy weapon hit, often for long stretches of time if you keep picking up shields and more shields.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart">Mario Kart</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Spiny Shell/Blue Shell... depending on the game. It's a powerful homing missile that fires straight at the player in first place... which is all well and good, but you generally only get it when you're in 4th place or below. The shell may completely screw over the person in 1st, but if you're that far back, this often has no actual effect on your position in the race. It's often best to either get rid of it so you can try for another, more useful item, or hold it while you try to get close to the front of the pack so the unblockable hit will actually give you a chance to move up.
<ul><li> In <em>Mario Kart 64</em>, <em>Mario Kart 7</em>, and <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, the Blue Shell takes out any player that is in its path on its way to the leader, which can be quite useful, particularly in tracks where there is only one main lane people stick to. In all other games in the series, the shell just focuses on the leader and has no effect on anyone else (unless they're close to the leader, and therefore within the blast radius, when it goes off).
</li><li> Note that it is possible to get a Blue Shell while you are in first place (either randomly as a remote possibility, or from certain item boxes that always contain Blue Shells). If you fire it, it will just hit <strong>you</strong>. Fortunately, in <em>Mario Kart 64</em>, you can drag it behind you by holding the weapon button to protect you from most attacks from the rear. Just remember to wait until the game registers the change in position before firing it at anyone who passes you.
</li></ul></li><li> The Thundercloud item in <em>Mario Kart Wii</em> plays out as a double edged sword. If you get this item, it's used right away so you can't store it. Under its effects, you get a slight boost in speed and you can go off road without slowing down. However, if it goes off while it's on you, you shrink and lose speed. You can pass it to another player by bumping into them, but it sucks to be you if there's no one in sight.
</li><li> The coin item in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioKart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioKart">Super Mario Kart</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart8">Mario Kart 8</a></em> is a letdown, since you have nothing to defend yourself with until the next item block and it just adds 2 coins to your total. In <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, you can get the coin item even if you already have the maximum number of coins, meaning it's completely useless
</li><li> The Feather item in <em>Super Mario Kart</em>, while a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> in specific tracks, is generally useless. While you can use it to avoid an item thrown onto the track, most of the time you can just go around it. Using the Feather while on a curve can throw you off the track due to momentum.
</li><li> The Bullet Bill is supposed to be a powerful item you get when you're in dead last. It transforms you into a bullet that speeds around the track, damages any other player you hit, and tries to let you catch up with the rest of the pack, but it always follows the middle of the course, and doesn't take shortcuts or the best racing lines, so the speed boost you get struggles to match what you could have done anyway on some tracks. It's even worse in <em>Mario Kart 7</em> and <em>8</em>, because it was made slower, so a skilled racer can easily do just as well without it, and surpass it with much better items. The duration of the item is also a problem; more often than not it will last even after you pass the next set of item boxes, so when it runs out, you have nothing else to help you. Furthermore, depending on when you use it, it can run out in the middle of a sharp turn or difficult section of a course, dumping you there and giving you very little time to change direction or otherwise recover. It's better to get two good items than one Bullet Bill. And you have no choice but to use it if you have it. You can't waste it or cancel it or trade it in for a different item.
</li><li> The Blooper item in <em>Mario Kart DS</em> and <em>Mario Kart 7</em> is made entirely useless thanks to having a map on the lower screen. While the item does make the AI slow down, more skilled players can play without being hindered by ink on the screen.
</li><li> Bowser and Bowser Jr's special item, the Giant Shell, in <em>Mario Kart Double Dash!!</em> is basically a green shell, but huge and with more speed. Its size and bounce speed is powerful enough to knock out players and course obstacles alike, but thanks to the unpredictability of the shell's path, you will more than likely hit yourself, and it is hard to avoid because of its huge size.
</li><li> The Golden Mushroom, depending on the course. If there's a lot of straightaways and not many bottomless pits, it's fine, providing several speed boosts before disappearing. The problem is that if there <em>aren't,</em> actually activating it means being flung off the edge of the track - and as long as it's still active, you can't replace it with any other item.
</li></ul></li><li> In several of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeed">Need for Speed</a></em> games it turns out that <em>all</em> vehicle upgrades are pointless. If the player uses an unmodified car, then the opponents in any given race will do likewise. However, paying for expensive upgrades allows the AI cars to equip comparable upgrades for free, negating the advantage. Then again, the games have such bad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberBandAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberBandAI">Rubber-Band A.I.</a> that having a more powerful car probably wouldn't have helped too much anyway...

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac">The Binding of Isaac</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Cat-O-Nine-Tails item. It is intended to be an upgrade to your shot speed, a boost that's entirely inconsequential at best and an actual hindrance at worst, since high shot speed makes it harder for the player to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenialOfDiagonalAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenialOfDiagonalAttack">whip shots diagonally using their character's momentum</a>. <em>Rebirth</em> fixed this by adding a damage boost to its effect, making it a genuinely useful item.

</li><li> The Dead Cat, which gives you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsHaveNineLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsHaveNineLives">nine lives</a>. The catch? It also drops your maximum HP to one heart, meaning that without the use of Soul Hearts, Black Hearts, or Eternal Hearts, you can take at most two hits before burning through one of those lives. Not so bad on earlier floors since you could still find an HP-increasing item to offset the drain, but effectively a death sentence on later ones.
</li><li> The fan expansion <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaacAntibirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaacAntibirth">Antibirth</a></em> plays with this trope with the Rock Bottom item, which lowers all of your stats... and then nullifies all further effects that lower your stats. It's still not that great, but it allows for some extremely useful combos, such as with Soy Milk.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note24muvh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note24muvh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note24muvh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Highly increases tear rate at the cost of a big damage reduction</span>

<ul><li> Taking the Boomerang Spells perk makes your spells arc toward you. Like the My Reflection item from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac">The Binding of Isaac</a></em>, this perk reduce the effective range of projectiles, and firing explosive or flaming projectiles becomes much more dangerous because they would fly into your face and harm you.
</li><li> With the Essence of Light perk, your body periodically fires bolts of light in 8 directions. The problem is, you will take 1 damage from a bolt's explosion. So you shouldn't stand on the ground when your body fires bolts, or you will receive some damage.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1">Fallout</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> An unnecessary number of Perks only give flat bonuses to skills when you have more skill points than you know what to do with by level 12 or so. Others are incredibly situational (Silent Death has 6 separate prerequisites that have to be fulfilled for its double damage to take effect), useless in general (Adrenaline Rush maxes out the easiest stat in the game to max out normally, but only when you're on death's door), or too weak to matter.
</li><li> The Bruiser trait increases Strength by 2 at the cost of 2 Action Points. Since stat points are interchangeable at character creation, and you get 1 Action Point for every other point of Agility, you can get the same benefit at half the cost by relocating two points from Agility to Strength (and even that's not a great idea given Agility is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll">One Stat to Rule Them All</a>).
</li><li> Armor Piercing ammo for 5mm and 10mm guns tends to actually be <em>worse</em> against heavily armored foes than Hollowpoint ammo. This is due to the way that damage is calculated: Armor Piercing ammo deals half damage but ignores some of the target's resistance to normal damage. The problem is that it doesn't ignore the flat damage reduction that the target has. This means that any target with damage reduction of about five points or more tends to take no damage at all from Armor Piercing ammo. Not to mention, crits ignore armor completely, which means characters with high Luck or a habit for aiming at eyes will do far more damage with hollowpoints.
</li></ul></li><li> The change of engine between <em>2</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutTacticsBrotherhoodOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutTacticsBrotherhoodOfSteel">Fallout Tactics</a></em> makes the formerly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a> Bonus Move useless 90% of the time. In previous games, it grants 2 AP that can only be used for movement. This allows melee characters to close faster and all characters to move tactically while saving their real AP for attacks and items. The <em>Tactics</em> version increases how much ground a character covers per AP spent, which means it's only useful when a melee character is pursuing a new target.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>, <em>most</em> of the Perks are suboptimal to the point of uselessness:
<ul><li> "Nerves of Steel", a <em>level 26</em> perk that boosts your AP regeneration by 1 point per 10 seconds - so inconsequential that it took slow-motion analysis and careful reading of the game's code to ensure that the perk even works. Compare to a level 20 perk, Grim Reaper's Sprint, which <em>maxes out</em> the player's AP every time they use AP to get a kill. This situation is somewhat improved in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em>, where Grim Reaper's Sprint is heavily nerfed to grant only +20 AP for a VATS kill, and Nerves of Steel improved to speed up AP regeneration by 20% instead of a flat value.
</li><li> Any of the skills that grant +5 to two skills / Size Matters (+15 to Big Guns) / Tag (+15 to any skill) are a waste compared to Educated (+3 skill points per level, for a final total of 78 skill points assigned as you see fit if you take it as soon as it becomes available) and Comprehension (+1 for every skill book you find, of which there are <em>324</em> out there). (Tag! was far better in the older games, as tagged skills also doubled the points you invested in them, meaning it could advance a barely-used skill to 100 in a single level.)
</li><li> Rad Resistance (+25% resistance to radiation) is pointless when rad-resistant environmental suits and plentiful anti-rad meds make managing your radiation levels trivial.
</li><li> Nerd Rage gives extra 20% Damage Resistance and boosts your Strength to 10 when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalStatusBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalStatusBuff">you're below 20% Health</a>. Strength is only useful for melee characters, who are likely already at or near 10 Strength and won't last long in close quarters with enemies even with the extra DR, which may go to waste anyway if you're already near the 85% <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">cap</a>.
</li><li> Mister Sandman allows you to silently and instantly murder a sleeping NPC. There are few good reasons to do so, and in those situations, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStab" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStab">sneak-attack</a>-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">headshot</a> will likely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> them anyway.
</li><li> Cannibal lets you chow down on corpses to gain health and lose karma. There are many easier ways of gaining health, and evil characters can lose karma more profitably by going on a slaving spree or robbing townsfolk blind.
</li><li> Night Person gives +2 to Intelligence and Perception between 6pm and 6am. Except the big advantage to Intelligence is giving you extra skill points on level up, which does <em>not</em> take temporary boosts like this into account. Only the Perception boost makes much of a difference, so you might as well take Intense Training and get +1 Perception 100% of the time instead of +2 50% of the time.
</li><li> Swift Learner gives a percentage boost to experience; great, right? Except that it's already incredibly easy to hit the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyLowLevelCap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyLowLevelCap">Absurdly Low Level Cap</a>. "Here and Now," which instantly bumps you up to the next level, has the same problem. It wasn't much better in the older games, either.
</li><li> Infiltrator and Computer Whiz allow you an extra attempt to force a lock or hack a computer. The lockpicking game is easy enough that there's no reason to ever force a lock, and the hacking minigame already allows you as many attempts as you want by just backing out of the minigame before using up your last attempt and starting over.
</li><li> Solar Powered gives you +2 Strength and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualRegeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualRegeneration">Gradual Regeneration</a> while outdoors during the daytime, but it's too slow to make a difference in battle (1 HP every 10 seconds when you likely have a couple hundred HP), and if you care about Strength, you've likely already got it maxed by the time the perk becomes available. To add insult to injury, in the vanilla game, taking this perk means forgoing the other two far-more-useful Level 20 perks, Ninja and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Grim Reaper's Sprint</a>.

The first increases her Melee Weapons speed and gives her a chance to knock down enemies with every melee hit while the second greatly increases your melee <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Hit</a> damage. Too bad she's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist">UNARMED</a> specialist and her Melee Weapons skill can never rise above 18, making this promising-in-theory ability absolutely useless if given to her. You're better off just keeping it for yourself, given it comes with no karma or reputation loss.
</li><li> Most consumable items have their effects multiplied by a value dependent on player skill in Medicine or Survival, <em>including the negative ones.</em> So, for instance, drinking Vodka in hardcore mode will increase dehydration by 25 at minimum Survival skill and 75 at 100 Survival.
</li><li> The K9000 Cyberdog Gun in <em>Old World Blues</em> can be upgraded to the FIDO gun, but because FIDO can't use the weapon mods that the basic K9000 can, it actually has lower DPS. It also requires a higher strength score and Guns skill to use, and worst of all switches from the cheap, easy to find .357 ammo to .44 Magnum ammo, which is expensive, harder to find, and (in Hardcore mode) weighs more.
</li><li> The perk "Junk Rounds" lets you craft bullets from tin cans and scrap metal. This sounds pretty good, but the recipe to do so is one scrap metal, five tin cans, and the appropriate shell casing. Per bullet. That means if you want to make enough bullets to fill your starting pistol's magazine, you have to lug 78 pounds of nearly-worthless garbage to the closest reloading bench. And even the garbage is more expensive than most bullets in total, so even if you somehow do find yourself with no ammo and a roomful of cans and scrap, you'd be better off finding a merchant and trading it for bullets.
</li><li> "In Shining Armor" gives a +2 Damage Threshold when wearing glasses or reflective helmets and a +5 while wearing metal armor, against energy weapons. This would be situational-but-good... but according to its listing in the game's files, it's not "energyweapons", it's "energy." Since the former is the actual descriptor for energy weapons, that one missing word means that the perk actually does nothing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>4</em> reworked the games' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkillScoresAndPerks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkillScoresAndPerks">Skill Scores and Perks</a> system, merging Skills and Perks, turning most of the Skills from the previous games into perks with multiple levels. As a result, the perks that used to be skills (governing things like weapon damage, crafting ability, healing item effectiveness, and sneaking) are so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">potent and often-used</a> that all the <em>other</em> ones seem <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolButInefficient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolButInefficient">weak or overly situational</a>. Often, you'll only consider the latter if level restrictions keep you from ranking up any of the former more—and since you can hold onto perk points indefinitely, you may save them up until you can.
</li><li> The third rank of the Explosives perk doubles the blast radius of all explosives you use. While good for most explosives, it makes it very difficult to use the Fat Man without killing yourself.
</li><li> Lead Belly reduces radiation taken from eating and drinking, eliminating it at higher levels. However, cooking most radioactive consumables will already remove all their radiation while boosting their health restoration (and sometimes provide other benefits) and giving some experience. The ones that can't be used in crafting, like pre-war food, generally restore very little health.
</li><li> The .38 receiver <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignItYourselfEquipment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignItYourselfEquipment">weapon modifications</a> changes a gun's ammo to the very common and cheap .38 rounds at the cost of a moderate damage penalty. However, these mods all have high Gun Nut requirements, causing a number of problems: By the time you get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterLevel">Character Level</a> high enough for the necessary levels of Gun Nut (2-4 depending on the gun), you'll probably have a steady supply of the standard ammo. The .38 receiver <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutuallyExclusivePowerups" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutuallyExclusivePowerups">replaces other, more powerful receivers Gun Nut will make available</a>, making the actual damage penalty much more severe. Finally, just having <em>one</em> level of Gun Nut will let you mod a pipe gun (the only weapon that normally uses .38 rounds) to do just as much damage per shot as most rechambered weapons and with a higher rate of fire.
</li><li> Rapid automatic receivers increase fire rate and decrease damage even more than regular automatic receivers. One would think you'd be exchanging ammunition efficiency for a higher damage rate, but the math works out to "rapid" weapons always doing less damage per shot <em>and</em> damage per second than automatic weapons with the same level mod. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless">The only time they're really worth anything</a> is when they're used on a Legendary weapon with an effect that triggers per hit which isn't base the weapon's damage.
</li><li> The lasers and plasma guns have "splitter" mods that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeShotgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeShotgun">increase damage while splitting it between multiple projectiles with high spread</a>, basically turning them into the Tri-beam Laser from <em>Broken Steel</em> and Multiplas Rifle from <em>New Vegas</em>. But the damage increase is ridiculously small (only +2 or +3 for weapons that start with damage in the 20s and get higher), so you're basically just giving your gun terrible range and accuracy for little benefit.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EndlessFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EndlessFrontier">Endless Frontier</a></em> — When combat robots Nacht and Abend join your team, they act as a Power-Up Letdown: they share a character slot with Gespenst, whose provides the best support attack in game. Since the robots take turns to appear whenever you summon them, the support attack become less reliable. This is somewhat made up by the fact that after they join, Haken gains a new special skill that involves calling them to gang up on a single enemy. While this attack can't be comboed into or out of, it also isn't a subject to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic">Forced Evasion</a> and it does roughly the same amount of damage as Haken himself would've done with his full set of attacks, if not more.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EtrianOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EtrianOdyssey">Etrian Odyssey</a></em>:
<ul><li> Landsknecht's Arm Heal is more or less a trap to make ignorant players waste their skill points. Like any skill, one can place up to ten points in it, which is a lot considering all characters have a hard limit of 73-78 or so points total to spend on <em>everything,</em> including all their useful skills, stat boosts, and their prerequisites. Level 1 Arm Heal is a head skill (meaning it can't be used if the Landsknecht's head is bound) that self-cures bound arms for 2 TP. In other words, one uses it when their arms are bound, their head is <em>not</em>, and it's somehow deemed more useful to spend the Landsknecht's turn arm-healing instead of having the medic do it or simply using non-arm skill-requiring regular attacks. But hey, at least it's practically free. Needless to say, its being worth even a single point is hotly debated, but not even its most dedicated fans advocate <em>maxing</em> it, as the only additional perks are that the cost of using it drops to 1 TP at level 5, and 0 at level 10.
</li><li> Protector's Provoke, a skill to goad enemies into attacking the Protector instead of anyone else, has a success rate <em>way</em> too low even at level 10 to be reliably used for the usual keeping-everyone-else-alive tank purposes.
</li><li> Medic's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TraumaCenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TraumaCenter">H. Touch</a>, a skill that heals the party for very low TP, but can only be used outside of battle and can only heal up to a certain percentage of their maximum health — for example, if the cap is 10% and someone has 100 HP, it will only heal for as much as it takes to bring them up to 10 HP, and is completely useless if they have more than that. The cap at level 10 is 40%.
</li><li> Fortunately, Provoke and Arm Heal (renamed "Unbound" as it is now no longer arm-specific) are dramatically improved for the sequel, and H. Touch is removed entirely. (The Medic's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a> in the sequel is technically called "H. Touch," but the actual move and effect are <em>extremely</em> different.)
</li><li> Protector's Anti(element) skills will <em>completely</em> block attacks of the corresponding element at level 5. If you upgrade them to 6 or higher, you will absorb the attack's damage and recover health, but this also lets through any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">secondary effects</a>. This has been fixed in various ways in other games: in <em>2</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">Millennium Girl</a></em> absorption prevents status effects and <em>3</em> required mastery just to completely nullify the damage.
</li><li> Each sequel attempts to avert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyLevels">Empty Levels</a> by having each point placed in a skill do something, like increase its effects, decrease its cost, or dramatically increasing its efficacy in exchange for a cost increase. Sometimes the increase in strength of the skill is not worth the raised cost. Other times the cost of the skill is so low that any savings in TP look insignificant at higher levels. Some passives actually scale so poorly past a certain point that further investment becomes a waste.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder">Fate/Grand Order</a></em> tended to enjoy throwing out near-useless skills in its early days.
<ul><li> Artoria variants had an unfortunate habit of being given Intuition/Instinct, which gave free critical stars in such quantities as to be virtually useless. When upgraded to its full potential, it could secure a one-turn crit, but most characters with the skill lacked the star weight or critical boosts to put those crits to work. Many characters with the skill have since had it upgraded to provide some other benefit, usually to the point that the crit stars are largely irrelevant.
</li><li> Clairvoyance and its variants are often considered even <em>worse</em> than Instinct, though they largely fit the same niche. It boosts the ability of its user to generate stars, but most characters with Clairvoyance have low hit counts, few Quick cards, unfitting classes, or all three, so they struggle to generate stars anyway. And while Instinct just gives you the stars right off the bat, Clairvoyance requires you to make a few attacks first to pay off. Even then, nearly any given Assassin has better star generation even <em>with</em> Clairvoyance up.
</li><li> Skills that reduce the effectiveness of enemy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Noble Phantasm</a> attacks get a lot of ribbing from the playerbase. They do lower the damage numbers of the strongest attacks in the game... but these attacks are only used by certain bosses, and they tend to only use them once every few turns. And enemy Noble Phantasms tend to have overkill damage, so even with the effect up, unless it's AOE and facing class disadvantage, usually an enemy Noble Phantasm still kills the target easily. The standard response to one is to use a skill that grants invulnerability or evasion for a turn to avoid the damage completely, not to tank it, and even if you do want to try tanking it, effects that grant Attack Down, Damage Cut, or Defense Up would do a much better job. The worst version is likely Aesthetic Appreciation E-, used by Caster Gilles. Not only does Gilles struggle to survive in most battles, much less against the game's strongest enemies, but the skill only reduces NP strength by 11% at max level; 89% is still going to one-shot Gilles with room to spare, and in the few situations where it would make a difference, it would still leave him with so little health that the next attack will finish him off.
</li><li> Boudica's Vow to the Goddess is probably the most infamous, increasing her damage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SituationalSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SituationalSword">against Roman enemies...</a> of which there are barely any, and Boudica's damage against them is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">so lousy normally</a> that it still barely scratches them. It eventually got buffed to stick the damage increase on the <em>whole party</em>, and added a party-wide crit damage buff on top of that, and it's still considered somewhat unimpressive. Funnily, it did get a pretty massive <em>indirect</em> buff with the existence of Romulus Qurinus, who has the ability to apply the Roman trait to enemies.
</li></ul></li><li> In most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> games, the Reflect spell is a disappointingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">Useless Useful Spell</a>. Normally, the spell is supposed to reflect enemy spells back at the caster. However, few enemies in most of the games use actual spells rather than unique monster attacks (which are not reflectable); many of the enemies who are actual spellcasters will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">use magic that can't be reflected or have a passive ability that makes all their spells ignore Reflect</a>. The most common creatures that cast spells are typically elementals, so reflecting their spell back on them will heal them. On top of that, Reflect also reflects <em>friendly</em> spells, like Cure and Esuna — which makes healing or buffing your party much more difficult. Reflect can be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> under the right conditions, but players will tend to ignore it as overly situational.
<ul><li> The Gravity spells also fall into this. You got a spell that can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PercentDamageAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PercentDamageAttack">cut an enemy's HP in half</a>? Awesome! Oh, wait. Most of the enemies and bosses are immune anyway, and any enemies that are not immune can easily be beaten with a few sword whacks.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI">the original</a>, the class change granted by Bahamut in the mid-late game is normally really good; it gives more possible equips, allows Fighters and Thieves to learn magic, and lets White Mages and Black Mages get their final spells. But the Black Belt, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk">actually gets held back by equipping weapons and armor</a> and can't use magic? Well, he gets nothing. In fact, for some reason, the Master actually has <em>less</em> Magic Defense growth than the Black Belt, meaning it's actually a <em>downgrade.</em> This was fixed in the <em>Dawn of Souls</em> remake, which made it so that Master also alters the Black Belt's damage formula to be better.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII">Final Fantasy III</a></em> for the DS, one of the level 6 White Magic spells — the second highest level a normal white mage can get — is Stona. All it does is remove the petrification status effect, which you can easily remove with a Gold Needle (which have been available for some time by this point). And due to the Level MP system the game uses (like with pre-GBA <em>Final Fantasy I</em>), this clunker shares MP with the more useful Haste spell.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em> for the DS gives you Inferno after beating Rubicante. It does more damage than essentially any other spell in the game. The problem is, it also hits your own party, and hard enough that you can kill your entire party in one hit even from full health. Expert players will equip their characters with fire-resistant items and Cursed Rings to avoid this. Though the Cursed Rings are normally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonMushroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonMushroom">Poison Mushroom</a>, they upgrade "resist element" to "absorb element", so a properly equipped party can use Inferno to damage the enemy and heal themselves. However, it is among the best abilities for raising a character's stats once that character reaches level 70.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em> has several:
<ul><li> Due to a bug in the code, the Evade stat is never checked; the "Magic Block" stat is used to determine evasion rates for for both magic and physical attacks. Since shields primarily boost Evade, they're virtually useless. This was fixed in the GBA rerelease. However, certain shields are good for blocking elemental attacks, particularly the Paladin Shield (which adds at least 20% to the MBlock stat on top of absorbing or blocking most elements)
</li><li> If you max out Terra's Magic and then use her Morph skill, her most powerful spells will do very little damage due to an integer overflow in the damage calculation. (But then, her level 1 magic will hit for max damage, so you don't really need the powerful spells that much <em>anyway</em>.)
</li><li> The Crusader Esper, the most powerful summoned monster in the game, can only be gained by fighting a series of eight dragons all around the world (two of which are in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">The Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a>). Unfortunately, when you summon Crusader, it also damages your party, which makes it basically useless. There are <em>other</em> benefits to having it, though, since it's the only non-losable Esper that teaches <em>Meteor</em>, and the only Esper anywhere that can teach <em>Meltdown</em> — two of the most powerful spells in the entire game.
</li><li> The <em>Meltdown</em> spell itself can be one of these, since it damages the party when you cast it. If your party members have Fire-absorbing gear, it's not such a problem. Quake is similar, but it can be mitigated by the Float spell. Probably the worst example, besides the aforementioned Crusader, is <em>Whirlwind</em>/<em>Tornado</em>; not only can it reduce your party members to critical HP, no equipment in the game will block it.
</li><li> In general, many of the later spells seem underwhelming because it's relatively easy to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Ultima</a> before you get the opportunity to learn spells like Meltdown, Meteor, and the like. Ultima is pretty much what it sounds like, and will quickly destroy almost all enemies within 1-2 rounds by the time you're over level 40 or so.
</li><li> In the GBA port, they added the ability to run without having to equip the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SprintShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SprintShoes">Sprint Shoes</a> relic. The relic hasn't been removed from the game, though, so equipping the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SprintShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SprintShoes">Sprint Shoes</a> <em>and</em> having autorun turned on makes your character move <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooFastToStop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooFastToStop">uncontrollably fast</a>. Some players rather like it, though, so it's unclear whether this is intentional or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug">Good Bad Bug</a>.
</li><li> If Sabin has learned the Soul Spiral ougi, which sacrifices his life to revive all dead party members, then you can no longer use him in the Dragon's Neck Colosseum (which allows you to enter your characters in automated one-on-one gladiatorial battles). He will almost always open with that move, making you instantly lose the match and, consequently, your wagered item. Similarly, if Strago has learned either Transfusion or Self-Destruct, you run the risk of blowing a round on a pointless suicide. Gau can also have a chance, depending on which Rage he opts to use.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> has several as well:
<ul><li> Magic Defense is based entirely on the character's intrinsic "Spirit" stat; pieces of armor that supposedly boost magic defense actually do nothing. Luckily, the PC rerelease (2012) version fixes the glitch.
</li><li> The Kjata summon. In theory, it should be fantastic; this is an attack which hits the Fire, Ice, Lightning, and Earth weaknesses on all of the monsters in the battle. However, the internal logic is actually <em>reversed</em>, and multi-elemental attacks use the <em>strongest</em> defense on the list — if even one of those elements is blocked or absorbed by a creature, then all the damage from Kjata is blocked or absorbed, no exception. In effect, multi-elemental attacks are <em>worse</em> than single-element attacks, because more creatures are left unharmed by them.
</li><li> Aeris's final <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a>, Great Gospel, is one of these. While it's a great <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a>, Aeris is lost so early in the game that you have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">know what you're doing</a> to actually get the power and train Aeris up to the point that she can use her level 4 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a> — and then you lose her and all that work was for nothing! <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note250wk8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note250wk8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note250wk8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Unless you count the achievement added to the 2012 rerelease as something.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em> has a couple:
<ul><li> Diablos is an extremely difficult optional battle, but defeating him lets you recruit him as a GF. Then you realise that he deals gravity-based damage, making him almost useless as a summon since 99% of the games bosses are immune. Fortunately, his innate Junction abilities make up for his lacklustre power in a fight.
</li><li> After Rinoa becomes a Sorceress she gains the <em>Angel Wing</em> Limit Break, which puts her in a berserk state where she fires off powerful magic. Unfortunately, this means that shell burn through stocks of offensive spells completely at random and you lose all control of her unless shes KOd or petrified. Rinoa will also never use cure magic while berserk, forcing you to look after her while she goes nuts. The Power-Up Letdown also extends to the main story, as Rinoa becoming a Sorceress has no effect on her magic stat.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em>'s Trance state, unlike <em>VII</em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Breaks</a>, can't carry over from battle to battle. If you happen to hit Trance while in a fight with a bunch of common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">mooks</a> that you're perfectly capable of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO">one-shotting</a> without it, which statistically is bound to happen far more often than not, then too bad, it's wasted.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em> has "Balrahn's Myriad Arms" (known as "Mythic Weapons" among the player base). Despite taking <em>longer</em> to complete than Relic Weapons, the true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity Plus One Swords</a> of the game, Mythic Weapons are almost all <em>significantly</em> less powerful.
<ul><li> Mythic Weapons require you to clear a large number of one-per-day missions, get a huge amount of rare materials, and kill several difficult bosses to gather the materials for a <em>single attempt</em> at the final fight that earns the actual weapon. All of which adds up to nearly a year of playtime to earn the thing (or more if you fail the final fight several times). Compare to Relic Weapons, which require a fraction of the time, a few relatively easy fights, and a massive amount of Dynamis currency (which is expensive, but easy to get if you have the cash to buy it).
</li></ul></li><li> There are plenty of examples in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Pokémon that evolves via evolution stone will learn fewer moves than their unevolved forms or, more often, will not learn any moves from leveling up at all. It's advisable to get your Pokémon to the level of the last move you want it to know that it learns through level-up before evolving. Thankfully, this was changed in Sword and Shield, where the evolved stone evolution can relearn any move its prevevolved form had. Say hello to level 15 Arcanine with Flamethrower before the first gym.
</li><li> The fifth gen adds a lot more examples courtesy of its Eviolite item, which boosts the holder's defenses by 1.5x (but can only be held by a mon that has yet to evolve). While in many cases better stats overall tend to counterbalance the loss of Eviolite, there are some mons that are made substantially better by the item than their evolved form. One good example is Dusclops; its stats heavily lean it towards becoming a wall, which Eviolite helps massively, whereas evolving to Dusknoir increases all of its base stats by a mere <em>five</em> points, except Attack which gains 30; admittedly useful, but nowhere near as much so as the defense boost which Eviolite can increase, to up to nearly <em>200</em>.
</li><li> Type: Null of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a></em> was once considered an example: it has a somewhat-above-average 95 in everything <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">except Speed.</a> And what's more, it has an okay ability in Battle Armor and can use Eviolite, making it a fine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a>. And then, in a touching scene, Type: Null breaks off its control helmet and evolves into Silvally... which doesn't help it much. Silvally's only stat gain is bringing Speed up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">the same okay-ish tier</a> as all its other stats. Its ability changes from Battle Armor to RKS System, which allows it to change its type to correspond with special held items. Problem? Those special held items do nothing besides change its type, meaning that all it allows Silvally to do is be a mediocre Pokémon of <em>any</em> typing. And obviously, it can't use Eviolite anymore. As a result of this, Silvally was considered worse than its pre-evolution. However, Type: Null eventually ended up untiered like most Silvally types, and the few Silvally types that did manage to have a niche in the lower tiers did so almost solely due to their type.
</li><li> Surskit possesses a unique design (a water strider), a typing (Bug/Water) that was completely unique for four generations, and pretty good stats for an unevolved Pokémon. When it evolves, it becomes Masquerain, which changes its design into a fairly generic moth and alters its typing to the fairly common and competitively awful Bug/Flying. Its stats do increase somewhat and it gets the good ability Intimidate, which lowers opponents' attack, but it's still outclassed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter">Butterfree</a>, and until Generation VII, it actually <em>lost</em> a few points of Speed.
</li><li> The fifth generation introduces the concept of "Hidden Abilities", new abilities available to various Pokémon, but only ones obtained in a certain way (usually by catching them through the now-defunct Dream World). However, a number of these Hidden Abilities are considered useless, either because the ability itself is bad, or because what the Pokémon already has is considered much better. A couple examples:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Delibird</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">as usual, seems to get it the worst.</a> Its Hidden Ability is the sleep-preventing Insomnia, which doesn't seem too bad, until you remember that one of its original abilities, Vital Spirit, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment">does the exact same thing</a></em>.
</li><li> Light/Heavy Metal as Hidden Abilities are relatively useless for the aforementioned reasons- the only Pokémon who have the Ability usually don't worry about Heavy Slam, Heat Crash, Grass Knot, and Low Kick, since they're heavy enough that it doesn't matter much and those moves are too gimmicky to use reliably. Several of them, including Metagross, are so heavy that they still take maximum damage from Low Kick and Grass Knot, even with halved weight. Bronzong also suffers because both of its regular Abilities remove one of its weaknesses (especially Levitate, against the omnipresent Ground-type moves). Aggron doesn't really benefit anyways, as it already has the maximum weight for Grass Knot/Low Kick to do most damage, and Heavy Slam gets full power + STAB even without Aggron's Ability; its original Abilities (Sturdy lets it get in at least one move without dying to Earthquake or a Fighting-type move, and Rock Head has only three recoil moves to work with, one of which is at least STAB Head Smash) are better than Heavy Metal.
</li><li> Scizor is particularly bad in this regard. Unlike some of its brethren, it actually is light enough for Light Metal to be factored into the damage it takes. On the other hand, it's already so light that Low Kick and Grass Knot weren't doing anything much to it in the first place (both moves would have a power of 80, and Scizor resists Grass Knot and is neutral to Low Kick). For the most part, all the ability does is make Scizor take more damage when it gets hit by Heat Crash or Heavy Slam. Meanwhile, one of its standard abilities is the phenomenally good Technician, which enables the powered-up Bullet Punch and Bug Bite that makes Scizor worth using to begin with.
</li><li> Starmie gets the Hidden Ability Analytic, which increases the damage it does if it moves last. However, Starmie is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a>, so it's widely agreed upon that this will rarely happen... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman">unless it's punishing a switch-in</a>.
</li><li> Tyranitar, like Scizor, is an example of both reasons. Its original ability is Sand Stream, which automatically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherControlMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherControlMachine">causes a Sandstorm once it arrives on the battlefield</a>, which is a highly useful ability in the metagame. Its Hidden Ability, however, is Unnerve, which prevents opponents from using Berries, and is widely considered to be situational at best.
</li><li> One other Pokémon that gets Unnerve is <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Mewtwo</a></strong>, whose other ability, Pressure, effectively halves the opponent's PP, which is much better against Pokémon with powerful moves that only have a few chances to use it anyway.
</li><li> Jellicent has the Hidden Ability Damp, which stops <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">self-destruction</a> moves like Selfdestruct and Explosion. Being a Ghost-Type, it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No Sells</a> both of those attacks anyway. Granted, this could still see use in Double Battles and maybe save it from an exploding Alolan Golem with Galvanize, but Jellicent's original two abilities are still considered too much better to bother.
</li><li> Rotom's alternate forms, as of <em>Platinum</em>, change type, keeping the Electric typing and adding a second. Rotom's Fan Form becomes Electric/Flying, a good typing. However, its ability remains Levitate, and both Levitate and the Flying-typing will cancel out Ground-type moves, effectively giving it a double immunity. Of course, you could also give it an Air Balloon to make it triple.
</li><li> Togekiss gets Super Luck as its hidden Ability, which gives a 6.25% boost to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Hit</a> ratio. Which would be fine and dandy, because you could just use a move with a high-crit ratio... but it doesn't get any moves with high crit-ratios. Its other usable Ability, Serene Grace, which has the immensely useful (and annoying) property of doubling the rate of additional effects, is far more useful than Super Luck.
</li><li> The Ability Pickpocket steals items upon getting hit by a contact-based move. Only problem is, nearly all of the ability's users are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannons</a>, so they wouldn't last long with their item; besides, they'd have to go into battle <em>without an item</em> (and virtually every Pokémon carries an item in advanced play). While Weavile doesn't really have a choice (it's much too fragile to use Pressure effectively), the Seedot line has the speed-doubling Chlorophyll and the reduced-sleep Early Bird to work from normally, which are better. Barbaracle is much better at taking hits, so it's better at it.
</li><li> Pickpocket's counterpart Magician, which activates upon hitting the opponent rather than being hit, has proven to be not even better. Aside from the existing going-in-without-an-item issue, Klefki has a much better ability in Prankster, which has made it an indispensable support Pokémon — without it, not so much.
</li><li> Wobbuffet gets Telepathy as its Hidden Ability, which makes it immune to ally attacks. While it does make it slightly more useful in double/triple battles, keep in mind that its original Ability Shadow Tag (prevents enemy from switching) was what made it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> in the first place, and even <em>with</em> Telepathy, Wobbuffet is still garbage in Doubles due to its inability to pro-actively do anything.
</li><li> Medicham was also an example before Generation VI introduced Mega Evolutions. It has Telepathy as well, which is worse considering its natural Attack stat is terrible, so it needs its <em>regular</em> ability (Pure Power) to doubles it. But since it got a Mega Evolution, Medicham's Telepathy Ability is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless">Not Completely Useless</a> in doubles/triples; it turns into Pure Power anyway when it Mega Evolves, so you can switch it in while its ally uses a spread attack that would otherwise hurt it. Pure Power in its normal form wouldn't be of any use because you would Mega Evolve it right away.
</li><li> Any Steel or Ground-type Pokémon with Overcoat (nullifies damage from sandstorms and hail) as a hidden ability. Because of their types, they're already immune to sandstorm damage. This is averted in Generation VI, where Overcoat gains the additional effect of making the user immune to spore and powder moves, which is very useful considering those kinds of moves can cause crippling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">Standard Status Effects</a> like Sleep and Paralysis.
</li><li> Trapinch was given Sheer Force as its Hidden Ability, which doesn't look so bad considering its high Attack. However, after evolving a Trapinch to Vibrava and then Flygon, its Ability switches back to the default Levitate, and you'd be pondering why Trapinch has a Hidden Ability in the first place.
</li><li> The Rhyhorn line gets Reckless as its Hidden Ability, which increases the power of moves that inflict recoil or crash damage on the user. The only eligible moves they can learn are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonElemental" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonElemental">Normal-type</a> Take Down and Double-Edge. Reckless Rhyhorn can only learn Double-Edge if obtained from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryOnlineContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryOnlineContent">defunct</a> Dream World, making it nigh-impossible to obtain the move and ability combo without cheating. Even with the Reckless boost, Rhyperior can do more damage with Earthquake and Stone Edge than Double-Edge for less risk, and its standard abilities (reduced damage from super-effective attacks and ability to redirect Electric-type attacks in double battles) are light-years better than Reckless.
</li><li> Darmanitan has Zen Mode as its hidden ability. When Darmanitan's health drops below 50%, it changes form from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a>, and gains an additional Psychic-type and much higher stats overall. While it sounds good in theory, it's anything but. If Darmanitan recovers its health to above 50% in Zen Mode, it will revert back, so good luck tanking hits with less than 50% HP. Furthermore, regular Darmanitan has a fantastic attack stat but its special attack is abysmal while Zen Mode Darmanitan has abysmal attack stat but having a fantastic Sp. Attack stat. Essentially, this means a Darmanitan have to waste at least one move slot for a special move, and waste EV points for its Sp. Attack stat, to take advantage of its Zen Mode, which won't activate until its health drops below 50%. And to cap it off, Darmanitan's non-Hidden ability is Sheer Force, which heavily buffs the power of all moves with secondary effects (at the price of removing those effects, but that's a small price to pay), making it hit much harder than Zen Mode Darmanitan. This means, ironically, that you'll almost never see a Darmanitan trainer that makes use of the species's signature gimmick.
</li><li> Durant receives <em>Truant</em> as its hidden ability. An ability whose only use is to balance out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Slaking</a>. Its effect is that the Pokémon attacks one turn and the next will do nothing. The only use for the Ability is for Durant to use Entrainment to give the Ability to other Pokémon and cripple them; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIBreaker">useful against the AI</a>, but any human player worth their salt will just switch Pokémon.
</li><li> Ferrothorn gets Anticipation as its Hidden Ability. Upon switching in, Anticipation... tells you whether the opponent can hit Ferrothorn super effectively or is packing a one-hit KO move. And that's all it does. It doesn't even tell you what move they have, which might at least be useful (knowing the opponent has a Fire-type move would be pretty helpful, as Ferrothorn <em>really</em> doesn't like Fire). Needless to say, this is a huge step down from its regular ability Iron Barbs, which damages attacking enemies on contact and can actually rack up quite a bit of residual damage due to Ferrothorn's tankiness. And just to add insult to injury, <em>its own pre-evolution Ferroseed gets to keep Iron Barbs</em>, meaning that if you obtain a Ferroseed through any means that can give it a hidden ability, it's entirely possible for it to go from a good ability to a crappy one on evolution.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire</a></em>, the Super Rod is an example of this. Sure, it lets you fish up Pokémon unavailable via the Old Rod &amp; Good Rod, but it also expands the games' fishing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic">Scrappy Mechanic</a> from a max of 3 "Oh! A bite!" checks to 6, making fishing with it much more tedious than necessary.
</li><li> Generation 7 introduced Z-Moves, once-a-battle effects that supercharge a regular move into one with devastating power. For the most part, they work as intended... unless the move you choose to supercharge is Acrobatics. Acrobatics has the unique effect of doubling in power if the user is not holding an item, which results in it being the one attack in the game that's actually slightly <em>stronger</em> than its Z-Move counterpart (110 attack vs. 100 attack), since the user is holding a Z-Crystal.
</li><li> While every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Mega Evolution</a> is stronger by adding 100 points to their BST (along with sometimes changing ability and/or typing), Latias and Latios are actually weaker Mega Evolved because they can't hold Soul Dew, which boosts their special attack and defense by 50% (amounting to a 120 point boost). Though in Latios' case, Mega Evolution is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless">Not Completely Useless</a> due to giving it a respectable physical attack stat. As of <em>Sun and Moon</em>, however, with the Soul Dew <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">nerfed</a>, Mega Latias and Latios get a bit more use. Mega Tyranitar also got this and still gets this from time to time; yes, it is extremely powerful, but it is also just Tyranitar with higher stats and no other changes, and while it has its uses as a Mega, most people will concede that regular Tyranitar is good enough as is and doesn't use the Mega slot that could be used on something with more potential to change the game.
</li><li> The Gigantamax forms in Gen 8 already only have a different appearance and a different version of one type of max move. That being said, quite a few of them manage to be <em>worse</em> then just a regular Dynamax of their respective mons.
<ul><li> Gigantamax Corviknight loses Max Airstream for G-Max Wind Rage, which breaks moves like Light Screen and Reflect. The problem is, the effect of Max Airstream is to boost speed, which Corviknight needs desperately.
</li><li> Gigantamax Drednaw loses Max Geyser for G-Max Stonesurge, which sets up Stealth Rock. Drednaw's hidden ability is Swift Swim, which means you'll usually want to have the rain that Max Geyser sets up instead, not to mention that Stealth Rock is widespread enough that you usually don't need to waste your Dynamax just to set it up.
</li><li> Gigantamax Orbeetle loses Max Mindstorm for G-Max Gravitas, which sets up Gravity instead of Psychic Terrain. Gravity does next to nothing for Orbeetle outside of boosting Hypnosis' meager accuracy, which it can't use while Gigantamaxed anyways.
</li><li> Gigantamax Eevee loses Max Strike for G-Max Cuddle, which infatuates the target. Not only is infatuation a lot more situational than the reliable Speed drop from Max Strike (infatuation only works on opponents of the opposite gender while Speed reduction works on basically everything), but Eevee that can Gigantamax lose the ability to evolve... which, given Eevee's horrendous base stats, means it tends to do absolutely nothing compared to a Dynamaxed (or even <em>non-Dynamaxed</em>) Eeveelution.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarOnline">Phantasy Star Online</a></em> has several rare weapons and armor that are upgradable. Usually this just makes them better (as is to be expected), but in the case of one or two of the weapons, it also makes them no longer able to do a combo attack.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretOfEvermore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretOfEvermore">Secret of Evermore</a></em> has the Magic Gourd. To get it, you have to trade the merchant for a Chocobo Egg, a relic which boosts your hit points. And the Gourd's effect? Doing <em>absolutely nothing</em>. The creators couldn't even remember what the Gourd was <em>supposed</em> to do while they were programming it in.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretOfMana">Secret of Mana</a></em> has a magic system where the player opens the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RingMenu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RingMenu">Ring Menu</a> and pauses the game, selects the spell, then the target - the target doesn't unpause until all of the spell components have hit, but you can still open the menu while the fireballs/crystals/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak">spinny air knives</a> are in mid air and basically spam spells on bosses until out of magic. The more you use the spells, the more they level up and get stronger. From about level six of nine, there's an increasing random chance to "critical" the spell for bonus damage - but during the special animation that plays, you can't open the menu, so by improving your spell you essentially cheat yourself out of being able to combo.
</li><li> The Aestevalis mechs from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsW">Super Robot Wars W</a></em> may be lacking in offensive power, but they have the Field Lancer attack, which has the <em>ignore barrier</em> attribute in a game where many of the toughest bosses have barriers, so they'll often come in handy. When they're upgraded to Aestevalis Customs, they lose said attack. Even worse considering that all the Aestevalis Customs are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game Breakers</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsReversal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsReversal">Super Robot Wars R</a></em>. On the other hand, they become useful on all terrain (instead of making you change frames like crazy for each level), and it's not like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">you can't remove barriers with</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar">Volfogg's Melting Siren</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">or anything</a>, making said trait redundant.
<ul><li> Dependent on the stage, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsGC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsGC">Super Robot Wars GC</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BlueCometSPTLayzner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BlueCometSPTLayzner">Layzner</a>'s upgrade into Powered Layzner or the Layzner MK 2 becomes this. On one hand, its mobility (which was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">already very high</a>) goes through the roof, and this is augmented by the power-up his unique ability gets (V-Max turns into either V-Max Powered or V-Maximum, both of which raise Mobility more and the latter of which raises movement range more). On the other hand, if you've been putting a lot of money into Layzner's weapons (which you want to, Layzner's ability to damage things is already very low), they get NERFED. And if you get the Mk 2, which is usually a better upgrade, you lose the only move that hits past range 4. If you aren't going to make use of his great movement range, Layzner upgrading destroys its ability to help you.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TerraBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TerraBattle">Terra Battle</a></em>, the A rank stat-boosting Companions are actually worse than their B rank counterparts. This is because the B rank Companions offer active "Stat+10%" buffs, which are stackable. In an average boss battle, that means a steady +40% buff in stats <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note26nwz1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note26nwz1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note26nwz1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The buff lasts 2 turns, and in a double pincer, the character can cast the skill twice</span>. In comparison, the A ranks only offer passive, non-stackable "Stat+5%" buffs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVI">Ultima VI</a></em> has numerous spells that don't actually seem to do anything useful, like lighting or dousing candles <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note27420t');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note27420t" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note27420t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">later it is used to ignite powder keg fuses</span>, making ordinary objects disappear, or even causing a solar eclipse. The game also has a spell that is the very definition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>: Armageddon, which <em>kills everything in the game</em> except yourself and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Lord British</a>. Great... except for the fact that the game is now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a> — it must be beaten by diplomacy, not combat.
</li><li> A lot of artefact items in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonCrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonCrawl">Dungeon Crawl</a></em> are even worse than their non-artefact counterparts.
</li><li> The sub machine guns and assault rifles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParasiteEve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParasiteEve">Parasite Eve</a></em> have very misleading x3 and x5 bullet modifiers. The total damage is actually divided among each bullet, and sometimes not all of them will hit. In a game of limited ammo, these are a liability. The actual ability that lets you perform two actions in one turn (allowing you to attack twice without having your power reduced) doesn't show up until very late in the game.
<ul><li> Weapons that have elemental modifiers are too situational to be of any use and you do less damage to enemies that resists certain effects. You are better off not using elemental effects at all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParasiteEve2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParasiteEve2">Parasite Eve 2</a></em> has some pieces of armor that let you see how much HP a targeted enemy has left. The armor pieces that have this feature tend to have poor HP bonuses and have very few pockets to carry items in. Naturally, all bosses are immune to having their HP being scanned.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou">The World Ends with You</a></em> rewards good relationships with store clerks by unlocking hidden abilities in the equipment you purchase from them. Unfortunately, Square Enix felt that some of these unlockable abilities were so "awesome" that they should come with drawbacks. One example is Platform Shoes, an expensive late-game item that can only be purchased from one store in all of Shibuya. It grants a sizable defense boost, but unlocking its ability causes even the weakest enemy attacks to knock you down. By this point in the game, most enemies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpamAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpamAttack">Spam Attack</a> unavoidable projectiles guaranteed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunLock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunLock">Stun Lock</a> you while wearing the shoes. The game power ups your expensive and rare equipment by making them suicidal to wear.
</li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a></em>, Mana Shield absorbs less damage at higher levels due to a bug. Also, leveling up Chain Lightning causes you to run into the sprite limit in one shot, causing disappearing lightning sprites and making it unreliable.
<ul><li> In <em>Diablo II</em>, regular Lightning is vastly better than Chain Lightning in all aspects, all of the necromancer spells except the direct damage line get worse as you go down the tree, putting too many points into Energy Shield causes you to run out of mana, and Cleanse gets worse at higher levels due to a bug again. Putting too many points into Evade causes you to stunlock yourself. For a while Zeal used to add more hits as you put more points into it, until it locked your character in place for about five seconds while flailing away at nearby monsters - and if the first attack misses, <em>all of them</em> miss. No lifesteal, no way to cancel out of it, you're dead. GG.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></em>, gaining access to the Master level spells of the Destruction school requires a lot of grinding, including through low levels where using spells as your main damage-dealer results in a much harder game, then finding and completing a special quest. When you finally get them, you find that they require two hands instead of one, take an insanely long casting time during which you're very likely to get interrupted by an enemy attack, and even if you do get one off, they do less damage for the magicka and less damage per second than lower-level spells, and since Destruction damage doesn't scale with level, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">Can't Catch Up</a> to archery or swordplay. ...Congrats?
<ul><li> There is one exception in Lightning Storm, which sends out a sustained lightning bolt that does high damage over time for an acceptable magicka cost, with extreme range and hitscan speed that make it perfect for destroying enemies like dragons at long range. Compared to spamming the lower tier Lightning Bolt, it deals somewhat less damage for a whole lot less magicka... which makes it great up until the point when your character can achieve -100% magicka cost and the formerly prohibitively expensive Lightning Bolt trumps it. Unfortunately, for many characters the free casting comes before achieving the Master level destruction spells, relegating Lightning Storm to the same heap that Fire Storm and Blizzard reside in.

Almost everyone ends up worse off for it. Unless you know the specific interactions that allow you to train them as Jedi and know how to milk as much Influence as you can, party members will become Jedi quite late in the game, leading to them never developing enough Force Points to be useful. Becoming a Jedi allows causes a character to lose out on the feats they'd naturally gain from their base class, and often the Jedi class synchronizes poorly with the base class.
<ul><li> Atton loses out on Sneak Attack, which lets him do massive damage to unaware or stunned enemies (which Sniper Shot or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>'s Force powers are easily capable of handling. He also gets fewer skill points, and his Scoundrel class already provides an identical Defense boost to Jedi classes' Force Sense.
</li><li> Mira doesn't get the automatic feats that drastically improve her damage and accuracy with blaster pistols (to the point where she can gun down Jedi with ease). Precise Shot can be purchased later; Targeting cannot.
</li><li> The Handmaiden loses out on her feats that improve her unarmed damage. Even though the Jedi classes get the Unarmed Specialist feats themselves, unlocking higher tiers of the feats are based on their <em>Jedi</em> class level rather than total level, stunting her unarmed damage growth.
</li><li> The Disciple doesn't lose out on any free feats... but his stats as a Soldier translate very poorly into the Jedi Consular he becomes.
</li><li> Bao-Dur gets hit the hardest. On top of losing his unarmed feats like the Handmaiden, Bao-Dur's electric arm prevents him from using any armor that doesn't inhibit Force powers, other than the +1 Defense Miner Uniform obtained at the beginning of the game.

Likewise, the amulet is useless in the final battle as the enemy only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">deals one damage per attack</a>, and no matter how high your defense is, an attack can't be reduced below that.

It allows the caster to transform into different animal forms with unique attacks, which sounds fun on paper, but there are a couple problems: A) the casting time takes ten seconds; you are completely vulnerable and likely to be interrupted before you pull it off, and B) the attacks go off the Strength stat, which most mage players will neglect in favor of Willpower and Intellect, otherwise the mage's other spells will suffer. The spec was most likely inspired by the Druid class from <em>World of Warcraft</em>, but the bear and cat forms in that game mimic the warrior and rogue classes respectively. The actual shapeshifting is instant and the forms give automatic boosts to the appropriate stats. None of that happens in <em>Dragon Age</em>, however. The spec is so useless that neither Morrigan (the resident Shapeshifter) nor any mage you teach the spec to will actually use its abilities in combat unless you program them to do so. Even the game's AI thinks it's worthless.
</li></ul></li><li> In the downloadable 3DS title <em>Witch &amp; Hero 2</em>, you unlock the witch's two magic attacks from the first game as you play and can upgrade her magic. Leveling up her spells generally makes her attacks stronger, shoot more frequently, and fire more projectiles in one wave. Storm's fire rate gets lowered to slightly above what it previously was each five levels it gets while adding one more projectile. However, at level 20, it permanently goes back down to two projectiles while not really improving in damage, and its max level fire rate is the same as it was at first level, turning it from arguably the best spell in the game to the worst spell in the game.

<ul><li> The bicycle that you can acquire in Twoson is free and speeds you up greatly. Too bad it can only be used when you are by yourself.

Basically you'll get to putt around Twoson just about long enough to get to like the bike, and then it will be nothing more than a useless wasted slot in your limited inventory space.
</li><li> The Bag Of Dragonite tends to be only moderately useful at best and outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonMushroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonMushroom">dangerous</a> at worst, despite the game treating it as such a valuable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse">Too Awesome to Use</a> item. It's a one-time-use attack item that not only has a chance of only doing minor damage (as low as 100 HP) but also has a chance of killing one of your own party members, and even it's most highest damage output it's nothing one or two PSI attacks can't accomplish.

The problem is that they also instantly overheat your weapons, making them useless for a few seconds. That, combined with the fact that the game has plenty of grenades, makes high explosives fairly useless. It still works well with the shotgun; explosive rounds and a few other upgrades give it an absolutely monstrous knock-back effect, without increasing the cooldown time beyond the maximum. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfHurting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfHurting">Since it takes longer for your victim to stand up than it takes for your Über-shotgun to cool down</a>...

You play as Uncle Fester using various guns to kill invading aliens. If you can get past that premise, you discover your initial weapon is nearly useless and only serves to kill the odd enemy to get a power-up for a better one (which moves in waves, meaning it can pass by enemies and get blocked by obstacles). The second power-up gives you the third gun, which is bowling balls being shot in a spiral pattern (again it can miss enemies and be blocked), but at least it's stronger. The problem here is that you can still pick up power-ups that downgrade your gun into near uselessness!
<ul><li> The third gun is rather useless in many situations as well, considering its wide firing pattern and inability to pass through walls. In narrow corridors, you become unable to hit enemies at all, even at close range!

<ul><li> The Laser Gun in the NES versions of both the above and the sequel (<em>Super Contra</em>) can't be fired rapidly. A second shot will cancel the first beam if it's still on-screen.

However, the Spread Gun in <em>Super Contra</em> only fires full spreads, and if it can't, you can't fire at all until a previous spread has <em>completely</em> cleared the screen. In addition to that, the Spread Gun "upgrade" makes it even <em>worse</em> — it increases the number of shots per spread from 3 to 5 and the number of bullets on-screen from 9 to 10, which means a drop from 3 spreads on-screen to 2.

There are multiple cannons (firing directions) which are basically devoted to firing only vertically, only backwards, etcetera.

Thus, until you get the best reactor in the game, you're better off not fully leveling all your weapons. Furthermore, the game contains a few "powerups" in arcade mode that turn your main weapon into something that doesn't shoot forward anymore (highly impractical) and one in story mode that turns your weapon into a hot dog. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeItem">The hot dog, however, is actually a badass weapon.</a>

Thankfully, this is one of the very few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootEmUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootEmUp">Shoot Em Ups</a> that actually has a way to <em>subvert</em> the trope- a specific skill (Bonus Lock) prevents your bonus weapon from changing when the skill is turned on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Eschatos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Eschatos">Eschatos</a></em> on Advanced mode causes your shot power level and multiplier to drop by one each every time you pick up one of the "F" items, which clear the screen of enemies, making them a liability whether you're playing for score (because of the multiplier) or survival (your shield capacity increases, but less firepower makes enemies take longer to kill). This wouldn't be a problem if the "F" items could be stocked up for later use instead of being triggered immediately.

However, due to a programming bug, Sam uses lethal attacks just fine without it; he quite literally stabs and slashes with his balled-up fist and can kill enemies by doing so. Once you have the knife there is no getting rid of it, and since it's metal, it prevents you from passing through metal detectors without triggering an alarm.

However they tend to be fairly useful if you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">know how and when to use them</a>:
<ul><li> Resetting the end-game timer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em>.

</li></ul></li><li> Starting with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a></em>, they began dumping loads and loads of weapons on the player (as opposed to the "one of each kind" mentality previous games used). Sad to say, most of these weapons you will never end up using as you typically get your hands on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PenultimateWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PenultimateWeapon">Penultimate Weapon</a> for Snake fairly early that you will become comfortable with using, and pretty much everything else you get simply won't be as effective, too clumsy to use, or just not worth mastering to begin with. If nothing else the developers anticipated this, and also started the Backpack mechanic in this game: weapons and items you don't intend to use can be stashed away, leaving your inventory far less cluttered and allowing for you to quickly cycle through items you do use.
</li><li> <em>Every</em> weapon carried by an enemy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVGroundZeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVGroundZeroes">Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes</a></em> is less effective than your starting load-out. The only reason you would ever want an enemy's weapon is out of desperation if you were out of ammo in the middle of a gunfight.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a> II</em> In Last Stand mode advancing your characters can be problematic. Your Space Marine Captain just got Fearsome Shout! Hurray! Now do you want to give up your jump-pack, 75 hit-points or your only close combat ability for it? The Ork Mekboy's Deffgun is even worse... how about a gun that actually <em>kills</em> enemies instead of just suppressing them?
<ul><li> In the Dark Crusade campaign, a few wargear upgrades - most notably Eliphas ascending to Daemonhood - actually reduce power compared to the earlier version. In that case, it's not so much because the Daemon Prince is bad; it's just that a fully-equipped Eliphas is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">so strong</a> that turning him into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposefullyOverpowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposefullyOverpowered">Purposefully Overpowered</a> endgame unit actually sets him back.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2">A2</a></em> boast the Last Berserk/Crit:Berserk ability. Equipping makes the equipped unit lose control and attack enemies randomly, with only a slightly greater attack, when it has low <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a>, which is basically the <em>opposite</em> of what you'd want. Equipping no ability is better than equipping Last Berserk.
<ul><li> The passive ability Doublehand lets you sacrifice using a shield or two-handed weapons to increase attack power by... 8 points. In a game where the unarmed cap for attack is 249, and the average unit gains that much attack in four levels. To make it even worse, the Attack Up ability, which has no cost beyond using up that ability's slot, raises attack by <strong>35.</strong>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em>:
<ul><li> In games which use Constitution, units almost always get a boost to it upon promoting. This is great for most units since it lets them wield heavier weapons without getting slowed down, but in the case of Warriors, Berserkers, or Generals, which tend to have high Constitution anyway, it often makes them so heavy that no mounted unit in the game can carry them.
</li><li> If you max out your defense, enemies fail to do any damage to you. In most games, this is great... but in certain ones, it will cause the enemy to avoid attacking the high-defense character, either ignoring them to pursue weaker targets or simply surrounding them until they can find easier prey. This is problematic, because easily the best way to take out a large number of weak enemies is to lure them into attacking a target that can kill them in one round; if they aren't attacking you, then that means the only recourse is to pick them off one at a time.
</li><li> Miranda in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThracia776" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThracia776">Fire Emblem: Thracia 776</a></em> promotes into the Mage Knight class, which provides her with a mount and sword use. In any other game, this would be great—but <em>Thracia</em> is the only game where being mounted has a significant downside, namely the need for mounted characters to dismount and reduce their movement indoors. This means that if you have her promote to Mage Knight and then dismount, she actually <em>loses</em> mobility compared to her unpromoted self—and most of the remaining maps are indoors anyway. Oh, and usually her Strength is so crappy that sword skills are 100% meaningless.
</li><li> About half of the promoted class skills in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones">Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</a></em> suffer from this.
<ul><li> General gains the skill Great Shield, which provides a percentage chance based on enemy level to negate the damage from one attack. Thing is, since it's based on enemy level and maxes out at 20%, most of the enemies to trigger it are unpromoted (and so don't do any real damage to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> General anyway), and it's not reliable enough to be counted on against the enemies that <em>would</em> threaten a General.
</li><li> Sniper gains the skill Sure Strike, which adds a percentage chance based on your level for an attack to always hit. Except both of the game's main archery units have really high Skill and bows have good hit rates to begin with, so chances are they <em>already</em> had 100% hit on most enemies. And even if they didn't, a guaranteed hit isn't very impressive if it only happens 20% of the time. Not to mention to gain Sure Strike, Neimi needs to pick Sniper instead of Ranger, which offers the much more useful advantages of a mount and sword use.
</li><li> The Lethality skill of Assassin will instantly kill an enemy 50% of the time if the character crits. Nifty—except if a raised Assassin got a crit, chances are they just killed the enemy anyway. Oh, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity">it doesn't work on bosses.</a> Not to mention Thieves trying to break into the class have to give up on stealing, while Myrmidons miss out on the crit boost from Swordmaster.
</li><li> On the other end of the spectrum for Thieves, Rogues gain Pick, letting them open doors and chests without needing a lockpick. Unless you obsessively open every door and chest, never steal any lockpicks from other Thieves, and never buy chest keys, you will never be at risk of running out of lockpick uses. At least you can still steal as a Rogue.
</li><li> Most promotion paths cause a character to gain movement, and promoting a character from Knight to Great Knight does provide a pretty impressive boost from 4 to 6. However, you can also promote Cavaliers, which start with 7 movement, into Great Knights. This reduces their movement, which effectively nullifies the whole point of being a Cavalier in the first place, not to mention making them much more susceptible to terrain. Hope being able to use Iron Axes was worth it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kieran's Gamble ability. It halves his accuracy and doubles his critical-hit chance, but he's already inaccurate and his crit chance is terrible (so doubling it will do almost nothing). Much better in the hands of a sniper.
</li><li> Corrosion is also pretty useless. It has a chance equal to the user's skill to weaken the target's weapon durability by the user's level divided by 4. This means that on a 20/20 character, Corrosion can take off 10 points of durability... when most weapons have at least 20. The odds that you'll get enough Corrosion procs to actually break an enemy's weapon before you kill them is pitifully low, and if you do manage it... Well, assuming they aren't carrying a <em>second</em> weapon, you've just disabled a single enemy in a much less practical way than killing them would have been. Worse, Corrosion can potentially proc on droppable rare weapons like the Rune Sword, lowering the number of uses the player can get get out of them.
</li><li> Every class has its own "mastery skill" that requires an Occult Scroll to learn. Scrolls that are in very limited supply, and some of these skills are just not worth it. The Sniper mastery skill Deadeye is the biggest offender: a Skill/2% chance of doubling accuracy, which is useless since Snipers almost never miss anyway, and half that chance again to put the enemy to sleep. Even though Sleep can be useful sometimes, it's not worth it with that low of a chance. Almost as bad are Roar, which gives up the unit's move to immobilize an enemy for 2 turns... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">except most bosses are immune</a>, and Vortex, which allows the unit to use a pathetically weak 1-2 range Wind Magic attack... and the only person who gets it is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower">11th-Hour Superpower</a> capable to tearing most enemies to shreds physically anyway.
</li><li> The Renewal skill scroll also counts. Restoring 10% of your max HP every turn isn't all that great to begin with, but the worst part is you can only get it by refusing Reyson's offer to join you. Reyson is an extremely useful ally capable of letting up to 4 characters move twice in one turn, and refusing him means you also lose Janaff and Ulki, two decently powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter">Crutch Characters</a>... <em>and</em> there's a super-powerful enemy in the next chapter who can only be convinced to retreat if you have Reyson. And in the Japanese version, it was <em>even worse</em>, as it only worked on Elincia and Ena, two characters who <em>already had Renewal to begin with</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemShadowDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemShadowDragon">Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon</a></em>, the two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement">Sword of Plot Advancement</a> items, Falchion and Starlight, both fall into this. To obtain Starlight requires you to sacrifice the Starsphere and the Lightsphere, two powerful and versatile held items that can be used by just about anyone—one negates the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons">Breakable Weapons</a> mechanic, letting you spam powerful and expensive weapons that are otherwise only limited by use, while the other negates enemy terrain advantages, making it great for bypassing the throne or gate defenses of bosses. So what do you get in return? Well, Starlight has the same damage and accuracy as existing tomes like Thoron and Excalibur, a paltry fourteen uses, and its only unique trait is being able to damage one specific boss who's otherwise invincible, Gharnef—who, on top of that, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkippableBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkippableBoss">Skippable Boss</a>. So why fight him? Well, defeating Gharnef is how one obtains Falchion—and Falchion is even worse. It's locked to Marth, who is a pretty subpar fighter to begin with, and it has the same damage as a common Silver Sword. It does effective damage to dragon enemies, including the final boss, but a forged Wyrmslayer or Dragonpike does a <em>much</em> better job of bringing down common dragons and can be used by just about anyone at that point, and on higher difficulties, attempting to kill Medeus with Marth is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss">more or less suicidal</a>. (This is notably different than in earlier games, where Marth could ably take on Medeus with the Falchion in hand.)

Note the existence of the Witch Hut, which teaches a skill for free, chosen at random. Even worse are the Scholars, because while a Witch Hut can be checked for its usefulness by sending in an expandable hero, the Scholar disappears after use. Many a Load Game is used upon visiting one to find one of the following:
<ul><li> Learning increases the rate at which you gain experience. In other words, it's a skill you get while levelling up that makes you level up faster. Possibly viable, if it weren't for its atrocious scaling, which means you'll gain maybe one additional level throughout your hero's entire career for the three levels you spent training in this skill. A few mods increase the usefulness of Learning by giving a hero who has it free experience out of combat and even allowing them to learn new spells at random.
</li><li> Eagle Eye gives your hero a chance to learn a spell cast by the opponent's hero in combat. Yes, you might get lucky and steal an opponent's Blind spell, but things like Expert Earth magic and Prayer+Expert Water Magic just pale in comparison. Plus, you can't steal level 5 spells even on expert level, which are much harder to come by, and much more valuable to steal.
</li><li> Scouting increases the hero's line of sight. It's not bad to dispel the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfWar">Fog of War</a>, but again not exactly as useful as most other skills.
</li><li> Navigation increases your movement speed over water. Very useful on water-based maps, completely useless on land-based maps.
</li><li> Mysticism is atrocious. At <strong>maximum</strong> level, it allows a hero to regenerate a whopping <strong>4</strong> spell points per day... in a game where the mana total of a hero that relies on spellcasting usually reaches the hundreds. Many mods make Mysticism replenish a percent-based value to increase its usefulness.
</li></ul></li><li> A few ships in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/KantaiCollection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/KantaiCollection">Kantai Collection</a></em> suffer from this, mainly by trading their increased resupply/repair resource requirements to a comparatively small boost in stats; Some even have a decreased luck stat, which is important for dealing critical damage.
</li><li> Skeletal Mastery in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftIII">Warcraft III</a></em>, depending on your preferred strategy. Without it, necromancers raise two melee skeletons from a corpse, useful for raising large amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">Cannon Fodder</a> to get in the enemy's way. With it, one skeleton is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a> that can attack air, but far less durable. Seeing as the basic Undead ranged unit has the ability to immobilize air units and bring them down to earth anyway...
<ul><li> There is an option to reveal the entire map for all players during the game, which makes the Night Elves' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnateNightVision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnateNightVision">Ultravision</a> useless.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChroniclesII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChroniclesII">Valkyria Chronicles II</a></em>, Cosette has the Klutz Potential, which causes her firing accuracy to be lowered. However, after the Yuell Mission, it gets replaced with Blood Trauma, which <em>reduces her AP to 0 when fired at</em>, making it the worst Potential in the game. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After the Doerfein Mission, however, this gets replaced with Beautiful World, allowing Cosette to take another turn.</span>
</li><li> Unique Units in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a></em> usually have a lot of bonuses over their standard counterparts, which then get lost when you research the techs from the next tier up. Even when they do keep the bonuses if they start as the unique unit and then upgrade, you also (usually) can't build your unique unit anymore once it becomes obsolete, so you pretty much have to keep a force of them alive for the whole game. For a perfect example, Poland in <em>V</em> has the Winged Hussar go from an all-around murderer with lightning movement to a specialized tank killer with less than half the speed, and the Zulu Impi loses its double-attack and anti-gunpowder abilities to become a bog-standard rifleman with whatever promotions it hopefully picked up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TreasurePlanetBattleAtProcyon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TreasurePlanetBattleAtProcyon">Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Warsloop in the campaign replaces the Torpedo Boat as the players command ship in Mission 3, despite being a more expensive ship with more guns (1 light gun and 4 medium guns compared to the Torpedo Boat's 1 light gun and 2 Torpedo Tubes), it is actually a downgrade, as the 2 extra guns it has do not make up for the loss of the Torpedo Tubes in firepower. The Warsloop isn't even much tougher than the Torpedo Boat and is slightly slower and a larger target.
</li><li> To a lesser extent, the Mortars, although they do a lot of damage, have a massive blast radius and huge range, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainfullySlowProjectile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainfullySlowProjectile">projectile travels incredibly slowly</a>, making it very easy to dodge, especially at long range, and to top it off a partial hit will often cause less damage than the stantard heavy weapons. Fortunately, it can be fixed with mods.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TenMinuteSpaceStrategy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TenMinuteSpaceStrategy">Ten Minute Space Strategy</a></em>, when starting a new game you can give your empire a trait "Escape", which gives every spaceship destroyed in battle a 10% chance of fleeing to one of your colonised planets. What the game neglects to mention is that whatever lucky ship that manages to escape will nullify every movement point a fleet already stationed at that planet had, leaving them immobile until your next turn, which can be infuriating if you wanted to send said fleet right on that turn.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> has the Flamethrower, an exclusive weapon for Chris' scenario. The Flamethrower isn't too powerful, its range is pitifully short, and there's no way to refuel it. The Flamethrower appears again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2">Resident Evil 2</a></em> and it has the same weaknesses, along with it taking up two inventory slots. It's at least extremely effective against the otherwise hard-to-kill ivy creatures, but there's only about five of them in the game, four of which appear in a hallway you only ever need to visit once, and it's a better option to just run past since you have a higher chance of taking a hit if you try and get close enough to fire on them with it.
<ul><li> The Assault Rifle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Nemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Nemesis">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a></em>. As an unlockable with infinite ammo, it's a decent weapon. However, you can also earn it as a final loot drop from Nemesis on Hard mode, but it happens very close towards the end of the game where you're probably packing the Magnum and Grenade Launcher.
</li><li> The Bow Gun from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2">Resident Evil 2</a></em> is barely stronger than the handgun and has a slow rate of fire, making it of little use to Claire (and a massive kick to the butt for players aware that Leon gets the very useful <em>shotgun</em> instead). It's only use is that it's a silent weapon, meaning you can fire on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">(the blind) Lickers</a> without them hearing the shot, but you're still better off using the handgun and alerting them to your presence due to the handgun's higher firing rate and superior stopping power. The Bow Gun would return as a much more useful weapon in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilCodeVeronica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilCodeVeronica">Code Veronica</a>, but was given a higher rate of fire, unlimited ammo capacity, and the ability to fire explosive bolts.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilOutbreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilOutbreak">Resident Evil: Outbreak</a></em>, most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting">weapons made by David</a> are far less useful than the items that go into their creation.

</li><li> The Self-Defense Gun from the REmake is so useless it's practically a waste of code. It's a gun that comes with one bullet, can never be reloaded, and is found <em>fairly late in the game</em> (You'll at least have the shotgun and, as Jill, the grenade launcher at this point). It does fairly impressive damage but it's nothing a dozen or so bullets from the handgun won't accomplish so there's really no reason to carry it, and it doesn't even have the decency to vanish from your inventory after use like every other one-time-use item in the game. Its only real purpose is triggering a unique cutscene against the giant shark, an act that requires ludicrously good timing and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">simply isn't intuitive to do</a> since your first instinct is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunOrDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunOrDie">run your ass off</a>, and it's actually rather easy to encounter the shark <em>before</em> you even pick the damn thing up in the first place.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em>, beating all four of <em>The Mercenaries</em> minigames with 5-Star ratings gets you the Handcannon for free, which can be upgraded by unloading $790,000 on it to get infinite ammo and 99.0 attack power. Sounds great, right? Except it utterly pales in comparison to the Chicago Typewriter which is obtained <em>much</em> easier, by beating the Assignment Ada minigame and paying $1,000,000. It is statistically weaker (10.0 damage), but that's still enough to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO">One-Hit KO</a> most normal foes, and it's an infinite ammo <em>machine gun</em> with a firing rate of 0.1 seconds, meaning even bosses fall to it in mere seconds. Basically, for $200,000 more and doing a <em>much</em> easier sidequest, you get a weapon that does the same damage as the Handcannon in <em>one second</em> of firing and is much easier and more effective to use.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SilentHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SilentHill">Silent Hill</a></em> series has some unlockable-for-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> weapons and other things that aren't up to snuff as prizes for beating the game go. The Hyper Spray from <em>2</em> doesn't deal a lot of damage unless you got a 10-star End Rank (and hurts James to boot!). The Flamethrower from the third game doesn't deal as much damage as you'd think, and also completely lacks any stopping power, which means the monsters are free to keep moving closer and attack. It can't even be used to bypass the deadly moth puzzle / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest">Fetch Quest</a>.

<ul><li> The chainsaw is fairly "meh" for what you have to go through to get it, as it's awkward to wield and doesn't actually give you much of an advantage over most enemies in the game.
</li><li> The SMG that you can unlock for Eileen might make the game easier for you, but the ending you get is dependant on how much damage she takes in the game and giving her a weapon makes her endanger herself by engaging enemies more. That's bad enough, but simply <em>holding the SMG</em> <a class="urllink" href="http://0ci0.tumblr.com/post/54693294937/silenthill3-eileens-state-deteriorates-while">deteriorates Eileen's state<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> over time, effectively making it a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonMushroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonMushroom">Poison Mushroom</a>.
</li><li> Silver Bullets. There are only three in the entire game, and while they have the seemingly impressive ability to instantly down the invincible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpider">Victim Ghosts</a>, they don't stay down long enough to be worth using in the first place. Made worse by the fact that one of the bullets can only be found in Eileen's Room, which is so late in the game there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">no more ghosts to use it on anyways</a>.

Skipping a third of the night sounds awesome, but the problem is that A) you're skipping the early hours when the enemies are not as active anyway, and B) you are really unlikely to survive a new night on your first try even with the 2 hour discount, but Fun With Plushtrap is not repeatable and if you die, your bonus is lost.

<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2002" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2002">the first game</a>, after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph">turning enemies into chickens</a> with the Morph-o-Ray, you can suck them up with the Suck Cannon. This lets you get Suck Cannon ammo from enemies too big to suck up normally. Plus, due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">helpful bug</a>, this actually gives you more Bolts than just killing the enemy. The Gold Morph-O-Ray turns enemies into <em>giant</em> chickens, which can act as decoys but are too big for the Suck Cannon, cutting off your source of free ammo and extra Bolts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankGoingCommando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankGoingCommando">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Going Commando</a></em> has three:
<ul><li> The Lava Gun upgrades into the Meteor Gun, which is vastly inferior in its primary utility of crowd control despite hitting harder and having a longer range. There are better ranged weapons than the Meteor Gun, although it is at least somewhat effective on larger enemies if you use the Lock-On mod. Fortunately, Insomniac learned and changed the upgrade to the Liquid Nitrogen Gun in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankUpYourArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankUpYourArsenal">sequel</a>, keeping the weapon good.
</li><li> The Clank Zapper allows Clank to zap enemies with lightning when he's with Ratchet. However, not only is the weapon pitifully weak, it also doesn't appear until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">Challenge Mode</a>, and it costs 1,000,000 bolts. By the time the weapon is available, you no doubt have at least one weapon that can empty out a room in a few shots, and by the time you have enough money to afford the Clank Zapper, you also have the option to buy either of the other two items with a one million bolt price tag; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">RYNO II</a> or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorOfInvincibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorOfInvincibility">Carbonox Armor</a> cost the same amount of bolts as the Clank Zapper, but both of them are vastly superior to it.
</li><li> The Megarocket Cannon is a downplayed example. It's not worse in any way than it's starting form, the Minirocket Tube, but the secondary effect that it gains is merely the ability to charge up and release up to four missiles at once. The problem is that charging it takes enought time that you could achieve better DPS just by rapidly tapping the fire button.
</li><li> The Lightning and Acid weapon mods deal an amount of extra damage so low that by the end of the game enemies are too tough for it to matter much, and once you go into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">Challenge Mode</a> their effects are completely cosmetic.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankUpYourArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankUpYourArsenal">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Up Your Arsenal</a></em>, there's the final upgrade to the RY3NO, the RYNOCIRATOR. While previous versions followed the usual missile-firing method, the fully upgraded version creates an energy ball that flashes the screen and destroys everything on it (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded">so if an enemy is off the screen or hiding behind an object, they won't be hit</a>). Oh, and it can also no longer hurt bosses and takes longer to damage enemies than the previous versions did. It can also break certain missions by destroying transport ships before they leave.
</li><li> While it isn't technically an upgrade, the RYNO V from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankFutureACrackInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankFutureACrackInTime">Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: A Crack In Time</a></em> disappointed many players by having a poor effective range and missiles that don't lock on to enemies and instead fly about randomly, from a weapon line famed for being overpowered death guns for couch potatoes. To a lesser extent, this also applies to the other two free-firing RYNO weapons: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankIntoTheNexus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankIntoTheNexus">RYNO VII</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2016">re-imagined RYNO</a>.
</li><li> Perhaps as a reaction to fan responses over the aforementioned Lava Gun, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3">PlayStation 3</a> titles have many weapons that do not gain significantly useful functionality when they are upgraded, with effects that are usually unnoticeable and not very useful. They feel worlds away from the days where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankUpYourArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankUpYourArsenal">upgrading a shotgun would give it a beam of death</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankSizeMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankSizeMatters">a sniper would gain rounds that exploded</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV">Grand Theft Auto IV</a></em> allows you to unlock remote-detonate car bombs, which at first seem like a very useful way to bypass the obligatory car chase scene that happens nearly every time you are sent on a mission to kill someone. But you have to place them in the car first, and because of the mission design, there are only a few times where you get a chance to go to your target's still-standing vehicle before moving on, as they usually start out with it in a cutscene or have it placed in a position you can't access beforehand.
<ul><li> Satchel charges in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a></em> fall into the same trap. They're only required for a few missions and they have very little use outside any mission where your target is already on the move. They're fun for a quick laugh if you want to screw around, but the money spent could have been used for other guns.
</li></ul></li><li> In the online <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> game <em>The Fright Before Christmas,</em> the player controls <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy">Billy, Mandy, and Grim</a> to fight endless hordes of evil toys. Each interchangeable character gets a choice of five buyable weapons. The most expensive, and supposedly most powerful, of Mandy's weapons are a handful of marbles and a pan of popcorn. The marbles are a three-projectile weapon that move in an arc, but are too small to hit more than three enemies, which becomes a major problem in the later levels with increasingly insane numbers of toys. The popcorn pan, to its credit, is more powerful, has a wider range and <em>would</em> be a better choice...if it weren't so difficult to control. To make matters worse, both of them are used up the minute they hit an enemy. Most players find more success with Mandy's third weapon, a doll thrown like a ninja star that consists of one projectile, but slices through hordes of enemies like butter.
</li><li> Some of the upgrades to the fortifications players can build in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar">Gears of War</a> 3</em>'s Horde Mode are not worth the money:
<ul><li> The first two levels of the barricade fortification are great. They slow down enemies trying to pass through them, giving players more time to deal with them and making them easier targets. The last two levels, however, are a let down in several ways. The barricades are changed to laser fences that make it impossible for enemies to pass through at all, which is much worse than it sounds. First, this just means enemies will repeatedly attempt to pass through until the barricade is destroyed, turning a manageable trickle of enemies into a sudden surge when the fence drops and every enemy comes through at once. Second, because of this, laser fences are regularly destroyed every round and must be fully repaired, making them much more expensive to maintain. Third, enemies will continuously recoil in pain while trying to pass through, which makes them much harder to shoot accurately because of all the moving around they do. Finally, the lasers deactivate if a player gets near to allow the player to pass through, which also allows enemies to pass unimpeded, unlike the lower level versions.
</li><li> The final level of the Decoy fortification turns it from an immobile target dummy into a real, computer controlled-soldier. While cool in theory, in practice the soldiers are dumb as rocks and can't be given orders, leading them to make suicidal decisions in combat. When other fortifications are destroyed, they can be repaired to the same upgrade level they were between rounds for a fraction of what they cost to build (including the lower-level Decoys), but if the max level Decoy, gets killed all of the investment put into building it is gone and it has to be rebuilt at the full price from level 1.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowIV">Saints Row IV</a></em> has the Tornado upgrade for your sprint power. It causes swirling air currents that pick up and damage any cars, people or debris you pass while you're sprinting. Sounds cool, but it can't be turned off, it doesn't do enough damage to enemies to be worth bothering with, and if you try to stop you frequently get clobbered by the vehicles and debris you're towing.
<ul><li> It's not <em>entirely</em> without use, though. Once you purchase this upgrade, the Mayhem missions become trivially easy. Just run around the city and watch as the Tornado rips up every single sign, piece of fence and pedestrian around you for a massive combo.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloonsTowerDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloonsTowerDefense">Bloons Tower Defense</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the sixth game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroUnit">Hero Unit</a> Quincy's level 7 upgrade is making him shoot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickArrow">arrows that explode on contact</a> every third shot. Unfortunately, the explosions area are too small so more often than not his regular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Roboteching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Roboteching">Roboteching</a>, bouncing arrows will hit more targets. Both of them do the same amount of damage anyway. This was fixed in a later patch where his arrows explode on first contact, but can still bounce to other targets.
</li><li> Any range upgrades on any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroUnit">Hero Unit</a> are effectively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyLevels">Empty Levels</a>. The range increase is usually only a few pixels, not enough to make any noticable differences.
</li><li> Laser Blasts upgrade on the Supermonkey. Usually Supermonkeys shoot darts which can't pop frozen and Lead bloons. Laser Blasts replace the darts with lasers which can pop frozen Bloons, but still can't pop Lead. However, lasers also can't pop Purple Bloons (which darts can pop). You'll face Purple Bloons no matter what, but frozen Bloons can be avoided by simply not using freezing attacks, so the tradeoff is minimal, if not worse. Fortunately, the next upgrade after that, Plasma Blasts can pop Lead bloons, as well as doubling the Supermonkey's attack speed.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Infinitode2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Infinitode2">Infinitode 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> Any upgrade that increases Rotation Speed and Projectile Speed, past a certain level:
<ul><li> Rotation Speed affects how fast your towers can rotate and aim at enemies. This means, once your towers can reliably follow the target's movement, there's no point in boosting it anymore. It's even more pointless since most towers are naturally fast enough anyway.
</li><li> Projectile Speed is even more pointless since most projectiles are fast enough even at base level <em>and</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomingProjectile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomingProjectile">they can't miss</a>. Only Venom Towers have slow enough bullets for a boost to have an effect.
</li></ul></li><li> The Minigun has the Hot Bullet ability, which causes enemies it targets to get inflicted with Burn debuff, so it takes even more damage. However, Burn effect overrides the much more useful Freeze (slow enemy movement) effect. The slight increase is damage doesn't justify losing the slowdown.
</li><li> Laser is a tower that shoots a laser in a straight line, heavily damaging all enemies the laser hits. However, its upgrades disagree with its function.
<ul><li> High-frequency Laser upgrade triples the laser damage, but makes the laser only capable of hitting a single enemy. Considering a well-placed Laser will certainly hot more than three enemy, this is an overall decrease in damage. It's only useful against bosses, which are rare, and are better dealt with using Snipers.
</li><li> Mirror System halves the laser's damage, but shoots three lasers instead of one. Theoretically this improves its total damage, except that the other two lasers are fired at such awkward angles they more often than not end up hitting nothing.
</li></ul></li><li> The Flamethrower tower as a whole. Its basic attack deal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffect">Burn status</a>, which heavily damages enemies over time. But as said above, Burn overrides the more useful Freeze effect, making the tower basically unusable. There's the Cold Fire upgrade, which lets the Flamethrower not inflict Burn. Unfortunately, a majority of the Flamethrower's damage come from the effect, so its damage is completely gutted.

Certain feats are also completely worthless:
<ul><li> Any casting-based class that provides less than full advancement is rarely worth taking, because it's rare for any class features to make up for being behind. Even worse is if the prestige class fails to provide any casting advancement in favor of either adding bonus spells per day or providing a completely new spellcasting progression (both of which ensure that you'll be saddled with a lot of weak spells that aren't able to accomplish nearly as much as the more powerful spells you'd have had access to without the prestige class).
</li><li> The Arcane Archer. Its primary ability (enchanting every arrow you fire) can be duplicated by simply owning any kind of magic bow, and despite requiring casting skill and having some of its other features key off casting, the class doesn't have a casting advancement.
</li><li> The Duelist attempts to lock the player into a traditional "fencer" fighting style (rapier and no shield or offhand, no armor, etc) and provides them bonuses while doing so. The problem is that said fighting style is <em>terrible</em> in 3.5, due to having bad durability and abysmal damage, and the Duelist doesn't do nearly enough to drag you out of the hole.
</li><li> The Reaping Mauler, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic">grapple-centric</a> class, has similar issues. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrapplingWithGrapplingRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrapplingWithGrapplingRules">Grappling with Grappling Rules</a> in 3.5 is already not a fun time, but when you're a grappler who can't be greater than Medium due to the class's requirements, can't wear armor when you lose your Dexterity bonus while grappling and need all the AC you can get, and whose features key off Wisdom, of all things, rather than the Strength or even Constitution that a grappler would actually need... well, suffice to say it's not going to make grappling a better experience.
</li><li> Dracoliches gain undead immunities, the standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">phylactery dealie</a>, and some minor abilities. None of those really make up for losing their Constitution score in the process, which usually ends up halving their HP.
</li><li> The Order of the Bow Initiate. Supposedly a group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet">Warrior Poets</a> who treat archery as a form of Zen, their primary feature, Ranged Precision, lets them fire a shot with a moderate damage boost. What's the problem? Ranged Precision doesn't deal damage to certain targets, can't be used at long range, and most importantly, <em>only fires one shot per turn.</em> Meanwhile, most archery builds are based on using full attacks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">get as many arrows in the air as possible</a>, since arrow base damage is fairly low—meaning that most of the time, the single boosted shot of an Initiate pales horribly in comparison to the six or seven shots fired off by a regular archer. (For added comedy, one of the prerequisites for the class is Rapid Shot—a feat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">designed for the above strategy,</a> that can't be used with Ranged Precision at all.) The class also has pretty intensive feat requirements for something meant to be entered at 6th level, making it hard for any character aside from a pure fighter to qualify, locking out better archery classes like rogues and scouts, which get bonus damage comparable to the Initiate, but can actually use that damage with full attacks to multiply it several times over. In short, it's a class that requires you to be a subpar archer... and then makes your archery worse.
</li><li> The Shining Blade of Heironeous's gimmick is to give their sword magic enhancements... but only off a very limited list (Shock, Holy, and Brilliant Energy). Activating this ability requires a standard action, you can only give one enhancement per activation, so you need to spend multiple turns to get your sword fully charged, the enhancement lasts for only a few rounds and goes away if you aren't touching the weapon, and it can only be used, at most, six times per day. This is the Shining Blade's only ability, aside from advancing divine spellcasting... which it does so at half rate, meaning maxing out Shining Blade puts you five levels behind on spells. At one point on the WOTC forums, someone put out a challenge for a build where the Shining Blade wouldn't constitute this trope. The "winner" was a 12th-level paladin/1st-level Shining Blade - for the uninitiated, paladin level 13 is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyLevels">Empty Level.</a>
</li><li> Pretty much all druid prestige classes are this. In their case, it's not for being poorly balanced—it's because the druid is universally regarded as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>, with its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">Voluntary Shapeshifting</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeastmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeastmaster">powerful pet</a>, and good-sized spell selection. Consequently, any prestige class that only advances or specializes in one of the three comes out as being worse than just taking more druid levels. It's worth noting that the Planar Shepherd, one of the few prestige classes that <em>does</em> advance all three, is universally banned.
</li><li> Some magic item abilities hit this trope as well. By far the most useless was the Spell Resistance enchantment for magic armor in 3rd Edition. It came in three flavors: Lesser, Moderate, and Greater, which granted Spell Resistance 5, 10, and 15, respectively. What made these useless is the way Spell Resistance worked in 3rd Edition: a creature would automatically negate the effects of a spell cast on it unless the caster could overcome it by rolling a D20 and adding their caster level- if the resulting number was equal to or higher than the target's Spell Resistance, the spell worked on them. A Spell Resistance of 5 was therefore completely useless against all but the lowest level spellcasters, and 10 and 15 weren't much better. The effects were clearly ported over from 2nd Edition without bothering to check their power, since in 2nd Edition magic resistance was a percentage check (5%, 10%, or 15% to completely negate a magic effect), which actually did provide a functionally useful defense.
</li><li> The Great Cleave feat. Cleave was a feat that gave you a free attack once per round if you dropped an enemy with a melee attack. Great Cleave functioned the same way, but could be used as many times per round as you successfully killed someone. In theory, the earliest you could qualify for the feat was 4th level, but in practice, unless you were playing a fighter, you couldn't get it before 6th. As fighters did not have a reliable way to significantly boost their damage as they leveled, aside from the reliable old Power Attack, and enemies that were weak enough to be dropped in a single melee attack would likely be starting to get scarce at 6th level, this was a major issue. Most of the time, if you could drop two melee enemies in a single hit at that point, they probably weren't much of a threat to you anyway.
</li><li> An abnormal number of feats only provide very small, flat bonuses (usually in the +2 or +3 range) to certain skill checks. Skill checks are some of the easiest things to boost in the game, between crafted items, masterwork tools, or simply pouring all your ranks into it; it's not uncommon to see skill-focused adventurers with a +12 or more by 5th level, quickly turning those bonuses into a drop in the bucket. Combat Casting is one of the most notorious, because it's almost directly obsoleted by Skill Focus (Concentration), which provides a +3 bonus to <em>all</em> Concentration checks, rather than a +4 bonus for one application of Concentration checks.
</li><li> Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">clumsy wording</a>, a strict reading of the Focused Lexicon feat (meant to make it harder for certain enemies to resist Truespeak) actually makes it harder for the <em>user</em> to use Truespeak against those enemies.
</li><li> Dodge is probably the most infamously worthless feat: it provides a +1 bonus to AC against a single foe that you designate. Even at very low levels, a +1 to AC (equivalent to about a 5% chance of working) is rarely going to block an attack, and because it only works on one enemy, it's useless against, say, a bunch of enemies attacking you at once (one of the few situations where a +1 to AC might reliably save you from a hit or two). There are multiple feats that simply provide a flat +1 or more to AC, which are still bad, but pretty much render Dodge obsolete. What really puts it in this category, though, is that the designers decided to make Dodge a prerequisite for <em>forty</em> different feats, and multiple prestige classes, which is a bitter pill to swallow for anyone interested in them.
</li><li> Probably the silliest example of this is the Mountebank and Risen Martyr, which both have about the worst capstone feature you could ever ask for: both classes are based on pacts with higher beings, so when you reach the max level in those classes, it results in the being you made your pact with deciding your time is up. In the Mountebank's case, you get turned into a demonic thrall and placed under permanent mind control, while in the Risen Martyr's case, you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">Ascend to a Higher Plane of Existence</a>—as in, you die. Whoops.
</li></ul></li><li> Auras tend to be this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>. Auras come into play attached to another card, and unless another card effect specifically says so, are destroyed if the card they're attached to leaves play in any way. This results in a powerup that's typically rather easy to eliminate, and after nets the opponent a two-for-one card advantage (the opponent spends one card to destroy the attached card, which takes the Aura with it). It tends to be a better deal to use a more impressive one-shot instant or sorcery boost for the same cost in cards and mana instead.
<ul><li> Wizards does seem to be aware of this problem if the totem armor mechanic, which saves the creature if it would be killed at the price of the aura, is any indication. There are also a few cards that return to your hand when the creature is killed, most notably Rancor, and there are some which can be "bounced" to your hand by paying a certain amount of mana. Auras are still typically useless in anything but a specialized deck, but there are notable exceptions.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>, a number of cards have "upgraded forms", usually requiring another card or other conditions, on top of the base form, to summon. Frequently these forms are not worth the effort for them.
<ul><li> Larvae Moth is pretty hard to summon: play Petit Moth, a very specific monster with bottom-grade stats and no effect, then equip it with a card that changes it into a mediocre <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a>, and then protect it for exactly two of your turns, at which you can tribute Petit Moth for Larvae Moth at last. For all your effort, it goes from 300 ATK to... 500 ATK. For comparison, common low-level monsters even at the time tended to average around 1400-1600, and they required no more work than Petit Moth to play. You basically sunk three cards and multiple turns of effort to turn a monster with terrible stats into one with still-terrible stats that can't benefit from Normal Monster support because its summoning condition counts as an effect (and it doesn't have any others). The higher Moth forms have an identical condition (bar the number of turns required), but they at least have tolerably high stats to push them into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">"awful, but someone might try building a deck around them for the cool factor"</a> territory. Larvae Moth isn't even on that level.
</li><li> Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon requires you to Tribute the already impressive 4500 ATK Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon to summon it. Though it gains a rather helpful form of targeting protection and an ATK-boosting effect, it also starts with only 3000 ATK, and said effect requires at least five other Dragons in the Graveyard to bring it up to the level of its lesser form.
</li><li> The very practical Cyber Dragon has a few branch "upgrades", and one of them is the very terrible Cyber Barrier Dragon. While it has a respectable 2800 DEF, its purely defensive effect only takes effect when it's in Attack Position, where its paltry 800 ATK leaves it vulnerable to most monster attacks. The only thing it does in that position is negate the opponent's first attack each turn — you don't even get to control if it triggers or not. It's definitely not worth giving up a Cyber Dragon for.
</li><li> Jinzo - Lord. Remember Jinzo? One of the strongest monsters in the early years of the game, with a solid ATK for his level and the gamebreaking ability to negate all Trap cards? Well, he's got an upgraded form. And it sucks. Where Jinzo can be Summoned with one tribute and no other conditions, Jinzo-Lord can only be Summoned by sending a Jinzo to the Graveyard from the field. That means that if you don't have a Jinzo, he's useless. Well, if he's got such a tricky Summon condition, he surely has a massive ATK boost of... 2400 to 2600, so 200 points. (For comparison, one of the most basic Equip Spells in the game gives a boost of 1000.) Okay, so in that case, he must have a truly game-winning effect, right? Wrong. Lord has two effects. The first is exactly the same as the standard Jinzo. The second is the ability to destroy all face-up Trap cards and deal 300 damage for each one. Unless your opponent is weird, you'd be lucky if they have even one or two face-up Trap cards on the field, and even if they did have a full field of Traps, they'd all be useless because of Jinzo's effect and there would be no point in destroying them. Sure, you deal some damage in the process of destroying them, but a maximum of 1500 damage to your opponent's life points isn't exactly a game breaker and there are easier ways to inflict direct damage. Plus, you're giving your opponent more space to use Spells, which is counterproductive. So he's essentially identical to the standard Jinzo, only with a miniscule power boost... oh, wait, Lord can't use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">Amplifier,</a> so he's actually inferior. The only possible use for Lord is to sub in for a Jinzo that's about to die through Jinzo - Returner's effect or tributing a Jinzo - Jector, which is a pretty dang limited set of circumstances for what's supposed to be an ace card.
</li><li> Red-Eyes Black Metal Dragon is Summoned by Tributing a standard Red-Eyes equipped with Metalmorph. A standard Red-Eyes with Metalmorph has 2700 ATK, and REBMD has 2800, so it's already barely an upgrade. What puts it into downgrade category is that Metalmorph has a secondary effect (which REBMD doesn't get) of heavily boosting your Monster's ATK when it attacks, meaning that Metal Dragon is actually a big step down from its lesser form in terms of offensive power, and only marginally better in terms of defense. There's also the matter of it only being able to be summoned from the Deck, not the hand. On top of that, the standard Red-Eyes is also the centerpiece of a variety of support cards, such as Inferno Fire Blast or Red-Eyes Darkness Dragon, and a Normal Monster, which gives it even more support cards. Pretty much the only advantage REBMD has over the sum of its parts is that it looks pretty cool.
</li><li> Life Stream Dragon was heavily hyped-up as the true form of Power Tool Dragon. Summoning it requires Summoning Power Tool, then Tuning it with a Level 1 Tuner... but on reflection, it's better to just keep Power Tool. Life Stream does have 600 more ATK, but Power Tool's effect allows you to add Equip Spells to your hand, meaning its ATK can be much higher. Life Stream can also make your LP 4000... but that's only useful if you're already on the verge of losing, since players start with 8000. Life Stream can also make you immune to effect damage, but there are plenty of cards, like Prime Material Dragon, that do it better. Life Stream attempts to duplicate Power Tool's destruction-dodging effect, but without the ability to search out Equip spells, it's much worse at it. Finally, Life Stream is a Tuner... but it's also Level 8, which makes the number of cards you can Synchro Summon with it sharply limited at best. The only real advantage is being immune to effect damage, and it doesn't outweigh the advantages of Power Tool at all.
</li><li> Few RUM-based cards are outright upgrades over their starting counterparts and many are situational improvements at best. Not helping matters is that not only would you need to get the correct Rank-Up Magic card, but the monster you have to upgrade off is overcosted or at an inconvenient rank.
<ul><li> Mechquipped Angineer upgrades into CXyz Mechquipped Djinn Angeneral—it gains 800 ATK, but swaps out its extremely useful protective abilities (able to save any of your monsters from destruction for a turn) for wholly unimpressive position-switching and burn effects.
</li><li> Number C5: Chaos Chimera Dragon boasts exactly one legitimate advantage over its unupgraded form, Number 5: Doom Chimera Dragon—while Doom must choose between two effects at the end of the Battle Phase (attaching a card from the opponent's Graveyard to it as material or sending a card from their Graveyard to their Deck), Chaos gets to activate both at once. Aside from that, they share the same effect of gaining 1000 ATK for each attached material and being able to attack all opposing monsters, but Chaos also gains two massive downsides: first, to activate the "attack all" effect, it must detach a material (something Doom doesn't have to do), and second, to activate the Graveyard effect, it forces you to <em>pay half your life points</em> (something Doom does for free). Curiously, Doom Chimera Dragon was released second, meaning it managed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a> its own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a>.
</li><li> Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon cannot be destroyed by battle, and forces the opponent to take any battle damage its controller would have taken when it does battle (which is likely to be hefty, considering its original ATK of 0), its detach effect can banish all cards that the opponent Normal or Special Summoned or Set that turn, and if it's destroyed while it has Xyz Materials, it can Special Summon itself from the Graveyard, gaining 1000 ATK for each banished card. This results in a monster that, while difficult to summon, can dish out tons of damage, banish cards en masse, and return with massive stats when killed. However, while its Number C form, Heart-eartH Chaos Dragon, has 1000 more original ATK (which is not nearly enough to do any attacking with it) and retains the immunity to battle destruction, it lost <em>every other effect</em> possessed by its previous form. Instead, it has a comparatively mediocre effect that increases its controller's LP by any battle damage they inflict on the opponent, and the ability to negate the opponent's card effects for a turn if its original form was attached (as opposed to banishing them). Keep in mind, this is the Ranked-Up version of a <em>Rank 9</em> monster. To say it's not worth it is a massive understatement.
</li></ul></li><li> Synchro monster Arcanite Magician has the effect of placing two Spell Counters on itself when summoned, both of which grant it 1000 ATK, and its upgraded form, Arcanite Magician/Assault Mode, has the same effect, but starts with 500 more ATK. However, where Arcanite Magician can remove a counter to destroy one card on the field, Assault Mode can remove both its counters to destroy all cards on the opponent's field. This seems like an upgrade... only removing both its counters turns it into a pitiful 900 attacker, meaning the opponent can easily flatten it. And more dangerously, where the original can remove the counters from anywhere on your field (like, say, a Magical Citadel of Endymion that can easily accumulate dozens of the things over the course of the game, meaning it can already effectively nuke the field), Assault Mode can only remove them from itself. It still has its uses, like replacing a burnt-out Arcanite Magician, but it's hardly the straight upgrade that most other Assault Modes are.
</li><li> "Savior" Synchro monsters, also known as "Majestic" in the TCG version, are great upgrades over their original form, except for one seriously heavy drawback: They return to the Extra Deck during the end of the turn and summon their weaker form into the field, leaving you -2 in terms of cards for a huge boss that only lasts a turn. Not to mention, they require a specific Tuner monster to summon, one that literally has no use other than to summon these Synchro monster upgrades.
</li><li> The venerable Gate Guardian is the fused form of Sanga of the Thunder, Kazejin, and Suijin, requiring all three on the field and then tributing them to summon itself. It has a colossal 3750 ATK, but it's also just one big monster with no other effects, making it rather easy to deal with. And Sanga, Kazejin, and Suijin already have pretty impressive stats and their own effects (even if said effects aren't that useful), and three monsters are by nature harder to get rid of than one. Simply equipping Sanga with United We Stand or something similar would give it even more ATK without needing to lose multiple monsters. This means that even in a deck that can somehow consistently summon the big guy, he's considered to be something you only bring out for bragging rights.
</li><li> Vampire Genesis, one of the earliest Structure Deck boss monsters, requires you to banish Vampire Lord to summon for a beefy 3000 ATK body and the ability to revive Zombie monsters by discarding higher-level ones from your hand. The problem is that Vampire Lord at the time was the best Zombie monster in the game because if he was destroyed by card effect rather than battle, he would revive himself the next turn, making him difficult to get rid of once he hit the field. Summoning Genesis requires you to remove the Zombie ace monster (so he can't even be revived) for a monster that loses that protection in exchange for a clunky revival effect that's outdone by the Book of Life copies that come with the Structure Deck.
</li></ul></li><li> Older <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhiteWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhiteWolf">White Wolf</a> games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">Old World of Darkness</a></em> tend to make how many dots you have in a Background more representative of how impressive the Background is, rather than how useful it is. As such, it's usually better to take only 3 Dots in a background rather than a full 5, as the latter often dips into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>, with mentors being nigh divine entities that are too busy to pay attention to you, reputations being world spanning names for yourself that draw endless public scrutiny, and backers being massive conspiracies who pretty much own you.
</li><li> As a rather hastily done marketing tie-in, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Serenity</a></em> RPG had a number of these. One strong example was Healthy As A Horse, an ability that improved your hit points. It cost exactly as much as upgrading your Constitution one rank did, gave exactly as many hitpoints as raising your Constituion did, and provided none of the other benefits of raising your Constition. Even if you'd already maxed your Constituion out (something you were highly unlikely to do in a normal game), taking it was still of dubious value given how damage worked in the game: typically the difference meant you were looking at being left alive with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury">Career-Ending Injury</a> rather than simply being dead.

<ul><li> Software updates for programs, mobile phones, and the like can sometimes be this. It is not at all uncommon to receive an upgrade, only to find said software or device is now slower, less compatible, has no recognizable improvements other than a few cosmetic changes, or even lacks features that a previous version had. This can even push into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonMushroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonMushroom">Poison Mushroom</a> territory if the upgrade was intended to stop homebrew apps from running, of if a glitch in it causes it to not work <em>at all</em>.
<ul><li> Likely the most extreme case of this was the "Other OS" feature on early PS3s. It originally allowed people to install a Linux operating system on their PS3 for bonus functionality, and PS3s had even started to be used in computing clusters due to their low price-point for their high power. But then a hack was found using it, so Sony patched it out, and anyone who didn't upgrade lost access to the Playstation Network, which handles essentially all of the online functionality of the native OS. A class action lawsuit was actually filed about this (by the military of the USA no less), though it ended up getting dismissed.
</li><li> Youtube's updates are also this for anyone with a below par internet connection, as each update seems to be an arms race between Youtube trying to limit buffering and force quality reductions, and viewers who want higher quality videos and would rather pause and wait for it to buffer rather than watch a 144p mess of pixels that's vaguely in the shape of their favorite <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/LetsPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/LetsPlay">Lets Player</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3439zz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3439zz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3439zz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Youtube will only load a video so far ahead of where you've watched, and if the video is playing faster than it's loading will automatically reduce the quality to speed up the buffering. There are no shortage of client side plugins, add-ons, and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">simple trickery</a> that force the video to load all the way when paused and will lock it at <em>least</em> a decent 720p, but these all seem to suspiciously stop working each time Youtube updates their site...</span>.
</li><li> To most users who rely on third-party add-ons, Firefox Quantum was this, owing to the countless add-ons no longer being compatible with it and how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">genuinely difficult</a> it is to downgrade to Firefox 56.0 and keep it that way<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note356p38');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note356p38" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note356p38');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Firefox will silently and automatically install Quantum and delete the incompatible add-ons unless you turn off check for automatic updates <em>and</em> mess around in the about:config screen</span>. Of <em>course</em> Quantum actually had countless valuable new features and bug fixes, but many users didn't feel this justified the loss of add-ons they liked or relied on.
</li><li> A fairly infamous case of this in gaming was a netcode update for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV">Street Fighter V</a></em>. According to the developers, it was meant to fix the poor netcode of the PC release. What it mostly did was shut down a widely-used mod that improved the netcode, dropping the game's online back down to near-unplayable territory.
</li></ul></li><li> In the magical world of cellular phones:
<ul><li> One unlucky user had his iPhone X outright <em>explode</em> after being upgraded to iOS 12.1. It was theorized to have either been a defective battery or charger, but the possibility that a glitch in the update caused the phone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking">exceed its safe limits</a> was noted to have theoretically been possible. Either way, in the words of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">Comic Book Guy</a>, "Worst update <em>ever</em>."
</li><li> And of course there's the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 that had two separate defects, a design flaw that could short the battery terminals and a welding defect that pressed too much on the battery. Anyone unfortunate enough to have upgraded to the first release of these phones were at real risk of having the thing spontaneously blow up in their pocket. Numerous injuries, a worldwide ban on air crafts, and an investigation likely to cost Samsung <em>billions</em> later, this was one hell of a letdown for users and the company alike.
