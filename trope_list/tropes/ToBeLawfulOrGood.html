The character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDilemma">must then decide</a> to either break the law and move towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood">Chaotic</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralGood">Neutral Good</a>, or put the law of the land first and become more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral">Lawful Neutral</a>.
</p><p>Three things can happen in these situations:
</p><p></p><ol><li> The character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">switches sides</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan">breaks the law</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered">removes his moral restraints</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight">in the name of doing the right thing</a>. This can result in a full alignment change to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood">Chaotic</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralGood">Neutral Good</a> or at least shake the character's stance, and also will often put the character at odds with other lawful characters. Woe betide a hero who does this if they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> superiors.
</li><li> The character wants to help, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered">cannot bring himself to break the established laws, codes or rules.</a> Maybe they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallStepsHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallStepsHero">believe that a breaking of the rules will result in worse things</a>, maybe they think that it is their job to be the force of order, leaving law-breaking up to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan">Vigilante Man</a>, or maybe they weren't as assured in their morals as they thought and the idea of doing something not enshrined in law scares them too much. If the moral oversight was too great, may result in them sliding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral">Lawful Neutral</a> or, in the case of really big infractions or cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyMasterRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyMasterRightOrWrong">My Master, Right or Wrong</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong">My Country, Right or Wrong</a> may lead them into becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Noble Demon</a> type of character, establishing them as a villain or causing previously heroic characters to effectively undergo a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>. If called out, they may try to deny responsibility by saying that they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders">Just Following Orders</a>.
</li><li> Clever characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a>. Maybe they tell something <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue">From A Certain Point Of View</a> or find a way of doing the right thing whilst <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">not violating the letter of the law</a> that would otherwise prevent them from doing so. Failing that, they may not be able to interfere themselves, but they'll contact the proper authorities or get a less Lawful character to act on their behalf, leading to a rescue by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry">The Cavalry</a>. A character may consider that not acting would be an even greater violation of his code or law system than holding back and letting things go through.

</p><p>Rather than save the villain he knows will go and kill more people, he rationalizes that letting him fall off a cliff isn't <em>technically</em> breaking any law... and while pulling him up would be the Right<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TradeSnark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TradeSnark"></a> thing to do, not pulling him up isn't a terribly evil action, especially if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil">they were mean</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">the dog earlier.</a> Or conversely, maybe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">something else is likely to catch up with the villain in the near future, anyway,</a> so that the consequences of saving the villain, letting the villain die, or killing the villain are all fairly equivalent.
</p><p>Note that while this trope is named for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> alignments, it still occurs in settings that lack explicitly categorized metaphysical morality; it doesn't require that the character have an actual alignment of Lawful or Good (or exist in a setting where those descriptions are meaningful), only that their personal ethical code and some laws that they normally respect are in conflict.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>This is somewhat a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, as many times in history humans have had to choose between what the law system expects of them and what their conscience or the circumstances demand. Despite this, no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> examples please. The fact that this trope reflects dilemmas that people have faced and pondered about in equal measure throughout the centuries is what makes it so recognizable; we must all have wondered what we would do if faced with a situation where we had to break the law to do the right thing from our perspectives; to breach societies' moral bounds to preserve our own. In addition Good Samaritan laws exist in some jurisdictions to help reconcile the two by protecting those who choose to be Good from any legal repercussions that might arise from their intervention in an emergency.
</p><p>Philosophers refer to this as a conflict between deontologist (lawful) and consequentialist (good) ethics: is the right thing what one has a duty to do, or what has certain consequences?
</p><p>This can involve everything from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face Heel Turns</a> to major plot points. While an attempt has been made to limit the spoilers, they are present.

Related to the logical paradox <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">Morton's Fork</a>. A defining feature for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMcCoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMcCoy">The McCoy</a> is that they will often never ponder this dillema for any prolonged periods of time; they <em>will</em> always end up choosing the "Good" option in short order, consequences (especially personal ones) be damned. In comparison, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpock">The Spock</a> will most of the time (though not always) lean towards the "Lawful" option, while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKirk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKirk">The Kirk</a> is the one who will most likely try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodVersusGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodVersusGood">Good vs. Good</a> may result if two characters choose opposite sides in the conflict.

However, faced with the prospect of the Book slowly devouring Hayate instead, they are forced to break their oath in secret in order to save her life, going to great lengths to at least ensure their victims are not <em>permanently</em> handicapped, in token adherence to Hayate's wishes.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> has faced this dilemma a few times.
<ul><li> When he was just starting out in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">The Golden Age of Comic Books</a>, he was more Neutral Good, and pretty willing to play fast n' loose with the law in order to do the right thing, but he became more Lawful as time went on.
</li><li> Depending on the writer, he is Lawful Good or Chaotic Good.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/KryptoniteNevermore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/KryptoniteNevermore">Kryptonite Nevermore</a></em>, a corrupt tycoon threatens Superman with having the law on him. Superman doesnt want to break any laws, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight">but he will do if he has to</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Superman:</strong> I can't let that happen! If worst comes to worst, I'll have to defy Harker  and take the consequences! Because there's a moral law that's above some man-made laws! I've fought tyrants before... thought it meant defying their inhuman decrees!
</div></li><li> The most glaring example that sticks out is in the second Superman/Spider-Man team up, when the heroes have just stopped Doctor Doom from conquering and almost destroying the entire planet, but Doom has fled to the Latverian embassy, and Supes says he can't arrest him because he's legally on Latverian ground.
</li><li> On the other hand, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SupermanBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SupermanBatman">Superman/Batman</a>: Public Enemies</em> storyline involved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> becoming President and declaring Superman an outlaw, so Supes didn't have much choice but to fight the government.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegendsDC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegendsDC">Legends (DC)</a></em>, Superman was the only one willing to obey the President's superhero ban, while the other superheroes simply chose to ignore it for the sake of doing good.
</li></ul></li><li> This was done to contrast him more with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>, who similarly drifted the other way, to "Good, not Lawful". This Lawful vs Good conflict has defined the drama that has been put on the Supes/Bats relationship since at least the '90s.
<ul><li> A good example of this is the one-shot <em>The Joker: Devil's Advocate</em>. The Joker is accused of murdering numerous people using poisoned stamps. As much as everyone is begging Batman to just let the Joker get executed, Batman can't let the feeling go that the Joker was actually framed and investigates.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorDoom">Doctor Doom</a> is himself a case of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> here as well. Doom prides himself on being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> monarch over Latveria. He considers himself to be <em>obligated</em> to provide a secure, prosperous nation for his people, albeit without any kind of personal freedom. That his nation is so peaceful and well-off serves as his rationalization as to why he has the right to do the same for the rest of the world. Even if that means conquering other nations and tearing down other systems of law and government. It's also worth noting that in most (as in nearly all) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universes</a> in which Doctor Doom takes over the world it has become a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Utopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Utopia">utopia</a></em>. And no, we don't mean a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia">Dystopia</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsaccharineWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsaccharineWorld">Crapsaccharine World</a> — we mean an <em>honest to God perfect society</em>. So, it may be that Doom is totally right when he says that the world would be better off under his tyranny, which would make him one of the most unique examples of the first type of this trope. Ultimately though, they fail because Doom finds actually running the world instead of conquering it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryIsBoring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryIsBoring">boring</a>.

</li><li> Then there was the decision of Sheridan and Babylon 5 itself to break away from Earth. It becomes more concrete and controversial the following year when the Earth Alliance Civil War comes to a head with numerous Earthforce commanders joining Sheridan in defecting. There are plenty in the course of events who ask Sheridan to explain himself, and he always explains: the Law is now run by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil">President Evil</a>; he needs to go, but that's as far as he wants to break the law. To maintain the moral high ground, he keeps a "clean fight". All his engaging ships are led by humans, they won't fire first, they shoot to disable when they can, and they always offer a chance to end or avoid engagement (the only time they didn't do this was when they faced Clark's most loyal and most advanced forces, under orders to ambush them). Eventually, after winning the war, Sheridan keeps his word and surrenders, allowing the law to judge him. He agrees to answer for his actions and resigns from Earthforce, though his story does not end here.

</li><li> Her father, Detective Quentin Lance, suffers from this as well, perhaps even more. He is dedicated to taking down the Vigilante on the grounds that he is a killer and a criminal, but the fact that he targets corrupt, wealthy people who cause harm to the people who work for them, and at times actively works with Lance to take the bad guys down, makes it difficult for him to rationalize his actions.

They frequently impersonate FBI officers and other officials to get the information they need on cases, and are constantly desecrating graves by digging up corpses and burning them to destroy ghosts. And while some of them like Bobby are able to balance having regular jobs with monster killing, others like Sam and Dean rely on credit card scams and hustling to have any sort of income. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroStoleMyBike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroStoleMyBike">And sometimes they steal cars.</a>

Two were at a basketball game and one was at the movies. This allows the team to return the money quickly to the victims of the loan shark</span>.
</li><li> In the series finale, "The Long Goodbye Job," there is one final confrontation between Nathan and his former friend Jim Sterling. Nathan is in favor of using chaos to serve the greater good, such as breaking the laws to take down corrupt millionaires. Sterling prefers order to uphold the law and will do anything in the letter of it to uphold justice, and as such is now a prominent member of Interpol. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Sterling realizes Nathan has his team successfully steal the Black Book, a hard drive with a complete and detailed account of what corrupt billionaires did to not only cause the financial crisis of 2008 but hide away over one third of the total money in the world, Nathan asks his former friend to report the break-in but omit the successful theft of the data. These men destroyed the world and need to be punished. If Sterling omits the fact the data was stolen, they won't be able to protect themselves from the horrors the remaining thieves in Nathan's crew will unleash. Sterling promises nothing, but an third person witnessing, another Interpol agent, has slowly been swayed by Nathan's argument and admits even she isn't sure what the right thing to do here is. Sterling doesn't answer Nathan's request before he puts Nathan in a prisoner transport car, knowing one of Nathan's crew is behind the wheel without even looking and leaving him a note that they are even for a major event from a previous season</span>. When asked if what he just did was hard by the other officer of the law, Sterling replies that, "Justice is always easy."

</li><li> Sects of Christianity which include the existence of Satan as the great tempter and it's antithesis Satanism can fit this depending on individual view point. While some view Satan, the former angel Lucifer, as a force of evil others view him as an angel who chose to be <em>good</em> as he viewed it rather then uphold the laws of a deity. Many of the tenets of modern organized Satanism suggest the latter but ultimately have little to do with worship of a figure named Satan. Conversely Jesus in Christian mythology chose to be lawful following the ordained series of events even though it was incredibly painful for himself and those around him.
</li><li> The Yazidi version of an Abrahamic myth of an angelic rebellion against God holds that, like Lucifer in the Judeo-Christian version, Melek Taus the Peacock Angel refused a command from God to bow down to mankind. The difference in the Yazidi version is that, rather than being jealous of humanity like Lucifer, Melek Taus viewed the command as <em>unlawful</em> in light of the First Commandment. God forgave him for this and placed the Earth under his care. (This myth is part of the reason the Yazidis have faced persecution by Muslims: the similarities between the myths have led to accusations of Devil-worship.)

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>:
<ul><li> In general (up until the 4th Edition) this has been a common case of player misinterpretation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment">alignment</a> system due to the mistaken assumption that any Lawful character will consider <em>all</em> laws to be equally valid. Under this logic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> characters would be unable to oppose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> ones so long as there was <em>some</em> kind of legal system involved. Interestingly, players rarely seemed to believe that the inverse principle was true. The idea that Lawful Evil characters might actively try to subvert a lawful society, or flat out try to overthrow its government entirely, was taken as a given in matters of Lawful Evil villainy. Properly played, a Lawful Good character will oppose any law that they do not believe benefits the cause of Good, a Lawful Neutral character will uphold law for its own sake (and may oppose attempts to change laws, especially with Good or Evil intent) and a Lawful Evil character will usually try to apply or impose laws that work to their advantage.
<ul><li> The Archons of Mount Celestia (Lawful Good) work together in perfect harmony to create an idealized heaven.
</li><li> The Modrons of Mechanus (Lawful Neutral) work within a rigid hierarchy whose entire purpose is to maintain the orderly functioning of their plane.
</li><li> The Devils of the Nine Hells (Lawful Evil) have a hierarchy as well, but it is expected that every devil will try to advance themselves at the expense of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">peers</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">subordinates</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">superiors</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Greyhawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Greyhawk">Greyhawk</a></em> campaign setting there were multiple cases of Lawful deities and their followers acting in direct opposition to each other.
<ul><li> The two war gods, Heironeous (Lawful Good) and his brother Hextor (Lawful Evil) are outright enemies, and their worshipers follow suit. The kingdoms of Furyondy and Nyrond were essentially governed by leaders who favored Heironeous and seceded from the Great Kingdom of Aerdy when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil">government of the latter</a> became increasingly dominated by Hextor worshipers who pulled the whole empire towards Lawful Evil.
</li><li> The gods Pholtus and Saint Cuthbert, who alternate between Lawful Good and Lawful Neutral depending on what edition you are playing, extremely dislike each other because both believe that they have the best notion of law. This results in their stiff-necked, legalistic worshipers getting into vicious arguments. Some Pholtus worshipers are so extreme in their conviction of their god's absolute rightness that they effectively become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">monotheists</a>, either ignoring other gods or flat out denying that they exist (despite reams of evidence to the contrary). This even became a problem <em>within</em> Pholtus's faith, as Lawful Good and Lawful Neutral worshipers (along with some who had even slipped as far as Lawful Evil) dubbed each other "heretics" over their differing views.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em> setting:
<ul><li> Tyr <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">was</a> one of the most staunchly Lawful Good deities. However, it is stated that his clerics "never enforce a law that can be shown to be unjust." Since Tyr's clerics could be either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralGood">Neutral Good</a> without losing their powers, good generally won out. Tyr was specifically the god of <em>Justice</em>, not law and order. If the conflict exists, his followers would conclude the problem is with the law.
</li><li> Also of note is the god Bane, who is Lawful Evil yet utterly heedless of any law other than his own. His worshipers are expected to conquer or otherwise seize all nations and bring them under Bane's control.
</li></ul></li><li> The Knights of Solamnia suffer from this in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em> setting, being more concerned with the rules and procedures of the Measure rather than actually upholding their Oath to defend the innocent and fight for justice. It takes Sturm Brightblade's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> for them to realize this, and then they rally to begin taking the offensive against the Dragonarmies. A later book also notes that the Knights begin going through the Measure and updating it so it allows them to better follow the Oath. However, all of this served as a plot device to emphasize the importance the saga's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader">primary heroes</a> as they had to overcome the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">enemy</a> with little or no help from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">Lawful Stupid</a> people who should have been doing the job.
</li><li> <em>Book of Exalted Deeds</em> gives an official solution to paladins trapped in this dilemma: always err on the side of Good.
</li><li> Oh, so common in the case of GMs that hate Paladins, that jokingly put the paladin, in the first seconds of the game, with the prospect: "Hey, they king is evil. What do you do? Protecting the weak is against the law and would make you Chaotic Good". In the old times of 2E it was awfully common!
</li><li> <em>Complete Scoundrel</em> gives them an entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass">Prestige Class</a> based around this concept, the Grey Guard. Although they are still forbidden from doing evil, they can play things a little looser when it comes to their vows than most paladins. Eventually they are released from their vows entirely, and can use their own judgement as to what is right.
</li><li> One didn't even need to look at the <em>Book of Exalted Deeds</em>: the Paladin's Code of Conduct in Third Edition implied the answer by the simple fact that doing Chaotic deeds doesn't make you fall on their own (whereas Evil deeds <em>does</em>), you have to do it enough to cease to be Lawful Good — so long as it isn't against the (short) list of things banned by the Code of Conduct, Paladins are entirely capable of breaking the law and remaining Paladins. They just can't make a habit of it.
</li><li> Camber of Culdi in the Deryni series demonstrated what the paladins <em>should</em> be doing of course. Find a legitimate non-evil heir of the previous dynasty and install him instead. Oppose evil the lawful way, duh.
</li><li> 4th Edition clearly draws a line between the two: a Lawful Good character tends to act according to the Law, while a Good character leans towards the Good. However, the game also stresses (more than any edition before it) that alignment is a guide and <em>not</em> a restriction.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planescape</a> had the Mercykillers faction, formed long ago from two lesser factions forced together by circumstance. The Mercykillers had grown so obsessively Lawful in their pursuit of justice and punishment that when the Faction War came at the end of the setting line, the Good members broke away and took up the name of the original Sons of Mercy faction they once were.
</li></ul></li><li> This situation comes up frequently in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendOfTheFiveRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendOfTheFiveRings">Legend of the Five Rings</a></em>, as Rokugan's laws are far from just. Most famously, when the Emperor is possessed by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Fu Leng, the entire empire is faced with the fact that the focus of their entire legal system is now basically Satan. Matsu Tsuko, leader of the Lion Clan, takes a much more tragic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seppuku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seppuku">third option</a>.

Someone whose allegiances are "Good, Lawful" will normally choose "Good" in this dilemma, while someone who is "Lawful, Good" will choose Lawful, and one whose allegiances are "My Kingdom, Lawful, Good" will be neither <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong">if it's necessary to serve their kingdom</a>.
</li><li> From the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/IronKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/IronKingdoms">Iron Kingdoms</a></em>, we have High Paladin Dartan Vilmon, who was ordered to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Purge a town of "heretics"</a> by the power-mad Heirarch Voyle. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShallNotPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShallNotPass">Vilmon turned on the Menite army and told them</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoThroughMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoThroughMe">"You're going to have to get past me,"</a> defying the law (the Heirarch orders someone burnt as a heretic, <em>you bloody well do it or you're one too</em>) and upholding good.

Edgeworth finds himself compelled to stand for Lawful because no one trusts the courts any more — and recruits Phoenix back into the attorney life so that someone he trusts can stand for Good. At the end of the game, Edgeworth takes a path that suggests both are in play at the same time: he evicts all prosecutors from his district who would choose to break the rules of court over diligent and thorough investigation. In this outcome, there is no good that can come from being unlawful; a good prosecutor needs one to have the other.

<ul><li> The story of the woman caught in adultery follows this to the letter. Jesus is asked to choose between imposing the death penalty by stoning for adultery (which would challenge the laws of the Roman empire at the time) or showing mercy (which would violate the letter of the Law of Moses). Instead, Jesus replied, "Let the one who is without sin cast the first stone!" This <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamingTheMob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamingTheMob">shames the mob</a> and they leave defeated.
</li><li> On another occasion, Jesus is presented with the chance to heal a man on the Sabbath, which they believed would violate the Laws of Moses.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1bg19');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1bg19" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1bg19');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">These laws forbid any kind of work on the Sabbath.</span> Jesus countered, "It is never against God's will to help those in need!" and proceeds to heal the man right in front of them. They don't take this very well at all.
</li><li> In the Gospel of Luke, a lawyer asks Jesus what he should do to inherit eternal life. Jesus asks him what the law says, and he replies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsTheGoodBookSays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsTheGoodBookSays">to love the Lord God with all his heart, soul, strength and mind, and to love his neighbor as himself.</a> The lawyer then asks Jesus who his neighbor is; Jesus replies with the parable of the Good Samaritan who helped the man attacked by thieves by treating his wounds and taking him to an inn to recover, while the priest and Levite just passed by on the other side of the road. When Jesus asks which of them was a neighbor to the man attacked by the thieves, the lawyer is too embarrassed to say it was the Samaritan (due to unfriendliness between Jews and Samaritans), replying that it was the one who showed compassion to the man. Jesus tells him to go and do likewise.
</li><li> Mainstream Christianity's interpretation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> as a whole can be summed up as humanity giving God such a choice by allowing evil into their hearts: the lawful option is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAllHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAllHumans">Kill All Humans</a>, but that's against God's loving nature. The good option is to simply forgive them, but that's against God's just nature. God's solution? Become human, absorb the punishment for their evil into Himself, and <em>then</em> forgive humans, justice and love both fulfilled.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>: As a classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> alignment debate; a very common problem for all Lawful Good characters, especially paladins, is solving such moral dilemmas. If roleplay is good (not "Me smash evil. Me bring justice") and the adventure is not a plain hack-n-slash. Interestingly enough, this rarely, if ever, comes up for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood">Chaotic Good</a> characters — perhaps because, by their nature, Chaos and Evil do not require characters to follow any specific moral or ethical code like Law and Good do — in essence, no conflict between two rival codes of conduct arises because, for these characters, only one exists. A Lawful Good person, by contrast, needs to hew to two separate codes — two which may or may not be in agreement over any given issue.
<ul><li> This is often a problem caused by malicious or lazy DMs laying paladin traps who forget that in most campaign settings paladins (like clerics) follow and derive their special class powers from worshiping deities. Smart players could legitimately point out that a <em>god</em> outranks a mere mortal king and that if a paladin has to choose between following the commandments of the deity who grants them their paladin status in the first place or the decrees of some mortal ruler who is acting totally out of line with the god's theology, then the paladin can and should feel free to ignore the mortal ruler. There are quite a few canon examples, especially in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Greyhawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Greyhawk">Greyhawk</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em> settings, where characters are solidly Lawful Good while directly defying mortal leaders operating at cross purposes with their gods. It is the reverse situation that players have more trouble justifying. <br/><br/>Even for paladins not following a specific god, the fact that gods are actual physical beings who regularly pop in to have a beer and chat makes these "traps" somewhat less than compelling for most players. Paladins aren't really the "divination" kind of priest themselves, but they <em>are</em> effectively still priests, and gaining access to a priest of the cleric class makes these moral dilemmas utterly meaningless. A cleric has access to a spell that allows them to ask a being that literally cannot be morally wrong for practical purposes whether a course of action violates the paladin code or not, with perfect accuracy and no chance of failure... at level one.
</li><li> The above probably accounts for why, in 4th Edition, they did away with Chaotic Good completely: you're either Lawful Good, and thus "bound" to honor both the tenets of good and the rules of law, or else you're Good, and you get to say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight">"Screw the Rules, I'm Doing What's Right"</a>. Somewhat annoyingly, the system also cut out Lawful Neutral, leaving a void where those who want to say "Screw What's Right, I'm Following the Rules" would belong (beyond being "Unaligned" and declaring that's the character's behavior).
</li><li> Classic example: A paladin under the control of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a> is asked to bring back the head of the good-aligned enemy king. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He does... except, after all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">the terms did not specifically rule out that head being still attached</a> to a living and very angry king with an army behind him.</span> Guess no one can accuse <em>that</em> paladin of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">Lawful Stupid</a>...
</li><li> The splatbooks specifically encourage this behavior from paladins, noting the loophole in their code about legitimate authority. Failing that, the <em>Book of Exalted Deeds</em> says that paladins being true to their ethos should always choose good over the law — the Atonement spell is there to be used for such occasions.
</li><li> The option between Chaotic or Good IS possible, to note. For example, a character who has to decide between sacrificing freedoms to do the right thing or doing something morally ambiguous for self serving reasons is example how it can be done.
</li><li> And then there's the third option within the third option: establish that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> character's "law" as a strict personal code of ethics, regardless of external law.
</li><li> In the fifth edition of the game, the paladin class as a whole takes a third option: their powers no longer derive from an unhelpful, trolling deity giving them a vague absolute command to respect "law" without specifying which law or what authority is rightful etc. Instead, the paladins are independent orders of knights-errant who draw their powers from an order-specific set of oaths explicitly defining what they have to do to remain a paladin. A paladin's alignment no longer has to be lawful or good, and in fact some oaths (such as those of Conquest) seem to lend themselves to the exact opposite of that.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> 2nd Edition tries to fix this up by giving the Paladin a number of tenets, some of which can be broken if they will serve a higher tenet (for example, lying to protect the innocent).

However, it's often clear he'd like to do what he feels is right even when it goes against Church law, particularly when it comes to helping out his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriend">Childhood Friend</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousPrincess">Veronica</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Considering he died and reincarnated along with the rest of the cast of the past, and that his reincarnation Ootomo can't seem to remember how he died, it's implied that at the very end he chose Good and went to help Veronica when her castle was invaded.</span>

The internal conflict eventually caused him to have a nervous breakdown and get shipped back home for the remainder of the war. In the present, he feels deeply ashamed over not speaking out about the injustices, feeling that he disgraced himself <em>and</em> the law he holds in such high regard by doing so. He essentially feels that theres no real difference between lawful and good if youre following the spirit of the law rather than the letter.

Valuing one's own choices over tradition and law is a Chaotic stance; preventing a civil war is obviously Good. As usual, neither the princess nor the movie angsts much over choosing Chaotic, since the three princes weren't keen on the whole "contest for her hand," either.
