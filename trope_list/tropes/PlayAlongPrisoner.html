Occasionally, the prisoner stays in prison <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightAsWellNotBeInPrisonAtAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightAsWellNotBeInPrisonAtAll">because there's no real reason to escape since he's working his schemes just fine from inside</a>.

He then becomes so annoyed by Italy's antics that he demands why Italy is not trying to escape, walks him to the door, opens it, and tells him he can go. Italy's reaction? He walks outside, flirts with a few girls, and comes back in. This is most likely because they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMatchMadeInStockholm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMatchMadeInStockholm">A Match Made in Stockholm</a>.

The warden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHAnging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHAnging">lampshades</a> this by getting angry that he uses the high-security zeppelin-prison as a taxi, getting caught only when he needs to get someplace far.
</li><li> Used to some <em>awesome</em> results in the second episode of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">the 2003 anime version</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, where Ed lets himself be captured to expose Father Cornello. Cue Cornello's surprised face when Ed casually starts eating his prison food, something that had been impossible moments earlier when he was chained up. Then he reveals the microphone that Ed used to broadcast their private conversation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredPublicConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredPublicConfession">to the entire town</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em>, the climax of the Yorknew Arc is when Kurapika finally catches the leader of the Phantom Troupe, Chrollo, but on the other hand, his friends Gon and Killua are captured by the Troupe. Kurapika demands a prisoner trade, with Troupe member Pakunoda as the intermediate. In their way to his location, Pakunoda observes that, weakened as she was, the two kids could easily overpower her, letting Kurapika free to kill Chrollo. The kids then say they are playing along so Kurapika does not go on the dark path revenge is leading him, to which Pakunoda thanks.
</li><li> In the Impel Down arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, Luffy asks Emporio Ivankov if he wants to help him bust out his brother Portgas D. Ace. He first replies that he'll only escape when the time is right, which would be the time when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">Dragon the Revolutionary</a> begins to make his move against the World Government. When he hears that Luffy <em>is his son</em>, he decides that the time is now, and sure enough, a massive jailbreak does occur, albeit barely succeeding partly due to another <em>break-in</em> at the same time.
<ul><li> We first see Silvers Rayleigh as a prisoner in a human trafficking operation. He later escapes easily and admits to a fellow escapee that he only allowed himself to be caught so he could rob whoever bought him at the next auction. He then realized that no one was going to pay for an old man like him, so he decided to cut out the middleman and rob the slave shop.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em>, Vash bumbles his way into a volatile scene and gets captured and tied up. He frequently escapes his bonds and does something weird to keep the situation from getting deadly but insists on staying there, getting tied up again, even at one point trying to re-tie himself up.
</li><li> Mikoto does this to some extent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/K" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/K">K</a></em>, because he's way stronger than anyone in SCEPTER 4 besides Reisi.

</li><li> At one point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Bakemonogatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Bakemonogatari">Nisemonogatari</a></em>, Araragi wakes up to find himself chained up and restrained by Senjogahara. Given their... interesting relationship, he plays along for a while trying to get her to tell him <em>why</em> she did this. But the moment he hears that his sister is in trouble, he snaps the chains and leaves, although it's later revealed to technically have been Shinobu who broke them for him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII">Lupin III</a></em>: If the title character is ever caught, he treats the prison as this. Although sometimes the prison may show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">him</a> it isn't that easy. This is even assuming he didn't plan this as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetIntoJailFree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetIntoJailFree">Get into Jail Free</a> gambit. Similar to his ancestor (see the Literature examples), if Lupin the Third is in prison, it's because he <em>wants</em> to be.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SpiceAndWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SpiceAndWolf">Spice and Wolf</a></em>, when Holo gets kidnapped, Lawrence carefully negotiates and then hires trained professionals to rescue her. When she is returned to him, she is extremely upset and reminds him that she is a goddess and could have escaped at any time. The only reason why she waited was that she wanted him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueRomance">heroically bust in, defeat the bad guys, and sweep her off her feet</a>.
</li><li> Dazai sort of does this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BungouStrayDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BungouStrayDogs">Bungou Stray Dogs</a></em> when captured by the Port Mafia. Chuya comes along and, after some talking, breaks Dazai's chains off of the wall so they can fight. Dazai then reveals that he'd actually managed to unlock the shackles on his wrists and thus could've gotten out whenever he wanted.
</li><li> Ban from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheSevenDeadlySins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheSevenDeadlySins">The Seven Deadly Sins</a></em> spent five years in prison, being nailed to a wall with huge steel stakes. He was deprived of sunlight, food and even movement. However, after he heard about his captain's return, he pulled the stakes out of his limbs, kicked the door down and went to the exit, while effortlessly defeating anyone who tried to stop him.

After a brief discussion, he decided to surrender (which took some effort since the Romans were scared) and have Getafix brew a special potion. The first one was a hair growth potion to trap the soldiers; the second was claimed to be a potion to stop the hair growth but was really a soup.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em> does this, though briefly. In the Channel Chasers story arc, Timmy ties up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the older version of him</span> who's secretly part of the resistance to prevent Vicky from obtaining power. When Vicky shows up about to blast them with a giant robot, he breaks free from the ropes and follows it up by saying 'For the record, I could have done that at any time'.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>.
<ul><li> In "Avatar Day" Aang is kept in stocks that he's small enough to slip in and out of at will, while in "The Earth King" he's bound by earthbender-made cuffs which, because he can use earthbending, he can take off and on at will. In both cases, Aang played along out of principle and to make a good impression on the people who were holding him.
</li><li> It turns out that after the Fire Nation seizes Omashu, King Bumi is one. They keep him locked up in a metal coffin-like cell that only exposes his face, but that's <em>all</em> he needs to be able to bend his way out at any time. Bumi explains to Aang that he's waiting until the right moment to escape, and when it comes (on the Day of Black Sun) he not only escapes but drives the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">entire Fire Nation army out at once, by himself</a>.
</li><li> The only thing imprisoning <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Iroh</span> did was give him time to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonsAreGymnasiums" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonsAreGymnasiums">work off the extra fat and build up</a>. Then, on the Day of Black Sun, he smashes his way out without any trouble and escapes. <em>Without</em> firebending.
</li></ul></li><li> In the fourth season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>, Ikki definitely takes after her grandfather in this regard. She's captured by two of Kuvira's soldiers and tied to a chair with rope but is easily able to slip her arms in and out of her bonds at will. When Jinora and Meelo finally show up to rescue her she shimmies out the ropes and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutRescuesTheyDontLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutRescuesTheyDontLike">complains that she had everything under control</a>.
</li><li> Near the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible: A Sitch in Time</a></em>, several members of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a> are captured and put in chains, after which they are brought to the throne room where the rest of the characters are. As soon as the characters who are free start kicking ass, the captured ones break their chains like they were made of paper and join the fun.
</li><li> In the premier of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck">Darkwing Duck</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Tauras Bulba has been running his organization from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuxuryPrisonSuite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuxuryPrisonSuite">Luxury Prison Suite</a> for years. When it finally comes time to break out, he presses a button and the <em>entire cell turns into an escape rocket</em>. Apparently, the guards should have possibly asked more questions about what he was doing in there.
</li><li> A small example of this occurs in episode 21 of the third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em>. Nabu had snuck onto one of the specialists ships when the Winx went to retrieve the water stars they needed to defeat Valtor. Since the Winx at this point weren't sure whether they could trust Nabu or not, they put shackles on him that would apparently prevent him from using his magic. Later when they are attacked by monsters, Nabu easily removes the shackles in order to save Aisha from a monster. Apparently, he could've gotten out of them at any time, but he didn't because Aisha had told him not to try anything. After the fight is over, he also tells her to put the shackles back on him since they have more important things to worry about than whether or not they can trust him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em>, Perry never makes any attempt to escape from Dr. Doofenshmirtz's traps until the very last second, at which point he does so easily. When he was trapped by chair-cuffs, he removed his hand to grab some popcorn, then <em>put it back</em>. At another point, Doofenshmirtz mutters that Perry could have been considerate enough to get in his trap during a delay, which he immediately does.
</li><li> In the Ruby-Spears <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em> cartoon, one episode had Mega Man get arrested by humans who, thanks to Wily, thought he was behind the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilScheme">Evil Scheme</a> of the week. As he didn't want to harm the humans he let himself be handcuffed. Soon after his name was cleared, he snapped the cuffs like they were nothing.
<ul><li> In another example, Mega Man decides that the best way to get into prison to rescue Roll and Dr. Light is to get himself arrested. He promptly does so, and soon breaks out to free them.
</li></ul></li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WildCATS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WildCATS">Wild CATS</a></em>, a friend of Grifter's has just finished a jail sentence. The warden is proud of the fact that he was able to hold a notorious robber for his entire sentence. Grifter simply said "You weren't holding him. He was just serving his time." Said robber proves this right when he breaks out of the prison in a matter of minutes, with the breakout starting the moment his sentence officially ended - just to prove that he could have broken out at any time if he'd wanted to.
</li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfSonicTheHedgehog">Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> episode, "Sonic Breakout", has Sonic pull this. In order to rescue a cartoonist who was put into Robotnik's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz">heavily-fortified prison</a> for an insulting cartoon, Sonic allows himself to be captured by Scratch and Grounder... but not before putting them through the usual shenanigans. Breaking out, however, proves to be tricky as Robotnik has built <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TailorMadePrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TailorMadePrison">a specially-designed wing just for Sonic...</a>
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperFriends">Super Friends</a></em> episode "The Giants of Doom", Bizarro, Sinestro, Toyman, and Captain Cold allow themselves to be captured by the Superfriends and placed in a specially designed cell. Once they are ready, Sinestro reveals that he can control his power ring even when it is not on his hand and they break free. Their goal was to gain access to the Justice League Computer. Amazingly, <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.seanbaby.com/superfriends/bizarro.htm">Bizarro<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> was the one who came up with this plan.
</li><li> Magneto in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen">X-Men</a></em> attempts a prison break to free Beast... who calmly informs him that he has no desire to escape and expects to get his day in court and be exonerated. While Beast may or may not have been able to leave under his own power at any time, he certainly has plenty of powerful friends on the outside who could have sprung him, should he have been so inclined.
<ul><li> In fact a few episodes later the X-men do break into the same prison to free Colossus, who was wrongfully suspected of Juggernaut's crimes. Colossus himself was playing along, not wanting to get in more trouble, but they convince him to escape because they need his help stopping Juggernaut. They offer to free Beast as well, and while he's more receptive to the offer by his friends than Magneto, Beast gives the same response of wanting to get released legally. Still it's clear the X-men could break him out just as easily if they truely wanted.
</li></ul></li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> reveals that Springfield Penitentiary is such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison">Cardboard Prison</a> that <em>all</em> of the prisoners are just playing along. When they are outside, the only thing keeping them from leaving is an unlocked door with a sign saying "Please do not escape". Snake does so anyway to chase Homer because Homer is driving Snake's old car and fueling it up with regular gas ("she needs premium!"), saying "screw the honor system!".

But if that's your attitude..." before proceeding to turn into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Intangibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Intangibility">Big Chill</a> and walk out.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em> episode "The Magnifying Mixture", when giant Hefty decides to take Gargamel and Azrael with him inside a sack as his prisoner to the Smurf Village, the evil wizard and his cat decide to play along as Hefty's captives until they reach the village. Once that happens, Gargamel escapes and ends up trapping giant Hefty in a sack.

<ul><li> When Entrapta is captured by Catra and Scorpia for interrogation, she barely seems aware that she's a prisoner, freely leaving her bonds at multiple times to examine everything in the room, including Catra and Scorpia themselves. By the next episode, they've completely given up on the idea of restraining her, and by the end of the season see her more as an odd colleague than a prisoner. Though that second part is because her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience">For Science!</a> tendencies mesh really well with the Horde's goals.

Jerry is put off by the daycare trying to serve his every need (to the point there's a person in a costume of Beth cooing them all) that he feels everyone is in a prison and so plots to escape with a seedy bunch of Jerrys...until they all reveal they're not exactly held captive and can walk out any time they want. Frustrated, Jerry walks out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">and learns the hard way that the world outside the daycare itself is incredibly dangerous, so he goes back into the daycare for protection and luxury</a>.
