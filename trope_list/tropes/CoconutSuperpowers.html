<p>There was a time, not so very long ago, when a fantastic fiction television program could get away with low-budget (and sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure">cheesy</a>) special effects to show that the characters had special powers. Think of all those "flying" props suspended in mid-air on fishing wire and you have the idea. Unfortunately, today's audiences are much more sophisticated. The days of sending a flying character jumping out of the set's window and then cutting to a cheap <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChromaKey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChromaKey">Chroma Key</a> effect to show him flying around are long gone.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>But here's the rub: the more sophisticated the special effect, the more expensive it is. And that is why, in series that center on people with extraordinary abilities, you'll see a lot of characters <em>saying</em> that they can do amazing things... but you won't often actually <em>see them doing them</em>. The opposite of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility">Mundane Utility</a> in many ways, <strong>Coconut Superpowers</strong> are any obviously budget-restrained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">Informed Ability</a>.
</p><p>Despite the silly connotations, though, it can often spark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerendipityWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerendipityWritesThePlot">very interesting workarounds</a>, as it often forces the creators to play things subtle or save the powers for a big moment. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreTools">Truly inventive uses of this trope</a> can captivate the audience as well as any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/VisualEffectsOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/VisualEffectsOfAwesome">Visual Effects of Awesome</a>, and <em>certainly</em> more than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure">Special Effect Failure</a>; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief">Willing Suspension of Disbelief</a> has a lot more flexibility than one would take for granted.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Common variants of this include:
</p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindProbe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindProbe">Mind-reading</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seers">future sight</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses">Super Senses</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath">emotion-sensing</a> are almost completely free of this trope, as all they really require is a decent actor to react to the power doing its work. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy">Telepathy</a> is also mostly free of this, since it can be expressed through voiceover. Because of this, communication-based <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> are very common in sci-fi. In the case of future sight, it might also require you to film an additional scene, possibly with a filter over it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation">Teleportation</a> shows up very frequently, because the plain effect of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthyTeleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthyTeleportation">Stealthy Teleportation</a> is as simple as doing a cut, and if the writers want to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashyTeleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashyTeleportation">Flashy</a>, they just need a light effect or fade-in while the object or person appears.
</li><li> Characters with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> rarely lift anything that the actor couldn't lift <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StyrofoamRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StyrofoamRocks">even if it was made of foam rubber</a>. For a long time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">telekinesis-wielders</a> were even more susceptible (can't lift anything that can't be carried by piano wires), but CGI models have taken a lot of the edge off.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flight">Flight</a> is becoming more common, but before the advent of CGI, it would usually require an actor to sit in a harness and overlay them on a moving background, which is <em>really</em> hard to have looking good. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> is much the same, minus the harness, though it can also be portrayed by having the character be too fast for the audience to see them move except for a vague blur.
</li><li> Characters with some kind of energy-related ability (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">fire</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">lightning</a>, most variants of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PureEnergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PureEnergy">Pure Energy</a>) are becoming much more common due to energy effects being some of the easier CGI tricks. Prior to that point, they would usually be portrayed via squibs and simplistic overlaid animation, or maybe a flame or Tesla coil effect if the show is particularly daring.
</li><li> Characters with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson">ice powers</a> will rarely use their powers to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessFreezing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessFreezing">freeze people or objects solid</a>, turning their powers into "shoot blue beams." They will even more rarely use their powers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalBaggage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalBaggage">to create large amounts of ice</a>.
</li><li> Characters with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginationBasedSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginationBasedSuperpower">Imagination-Based Superpower</a> will only create simple props. Sometimes those props have a glow effect.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shapeshifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shapeshifter">Shapeshifter</a> characters have their work cut out for them, because along with the shapeshifting effect, this power also requires whatever they turned into to be moving around on set. Because of this, a lot of shapeshifters stick with turning into humans, and often only turn into existing characters who can then solve the problem by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActingForTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActingForTwo">Acting for Two</a>. Characters who can turn into animals deal with the problems of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverWorkWithChildrenOrAnimals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverWorkWithChildrenOrAnimals">having trained animals</a> on set, so the ones that do tend to turn into only one or two different animals (just use the same trained one). Characters who turn into something monstrous tend to spend as much time as possible as a human. The shapeshifting effect itself may be obscured or offscreen, and when it isn't, it will usually be a quick "morph" effect.
</li><li> Robotic characters tend to fit the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobot">Ridiculously Human Robot</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinCanRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinCanRobot">Tin-Can Robot</a> molds, with very little in between. Characters who are clearly robotic but still clearly sophisticated and not a prop or a man in a chunky costume are very rare.
</li><li> Many 80's schlock fantasy films have their great and powerful sorcerers limited to squibs or firepots for fights, and images superimposed on birdbaths for scrying. If they're really trying, you might get some splotches in those colors you see when you look at a lightbulb too closely.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceOpera">Space Opera</a> shows, you tend to see many encounters with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Human Aliens</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberForeheadAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberForeheadAliens">Rubber-Forehead Aliens</a>, which are the easiest for a human to pull off. Not far down from that is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings">Energy Beings</a>, which can be rendered as a simple glowing blob. Spaceship models also have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropRecycling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropRecycling">a tendency to be recycled.</a>
</li></ul><p>Coconut Superpowers are for the most part only averted successfully in fully 2D-animated shows. It's often not a concern in films, as they usually have larger budgets (though it can still happen; some actions are still hard to animate).

<ul><li> The animated equivalent of Coconut Superpowers is something difficult and expensive to animate, such as an accurate depiction of people playing musical instruments. One of the main criticisms against <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn">K-On!</a></em> is not only that it's about a high school rock band who avoid practicing as much as possible, but even when they do play, most of the time the camera cuts away just as they begin and cuts back when they finish. This is especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> because <em>K-ON!</em> is produced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KyotoAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KyotoAnimation">Kyoto Animation</a>, who had previously animated an astonishingly good scene of a rock band performance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em>. There's a rumor that the animators got so bored/exhausted animating the latter that they don't want to animate any more band scenes, but that just presents the question of why they would then do a series about a band.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Film  Animated </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Parodied in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles">The Incredibles</a></em> DVD Extra, with a horribly low-budget <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">in-universe animated show</a> in which most superpower use is just off-screen. Made even funnier in the commentary on the DVD, which is made by Frozone and Mr. Incredible themselves. Frozone is less than impressed. That cartoon was a parody of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClutchCargo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClutchCargo">Clutch Cargo</a></em>, a series from the late 1950s which also used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SynchroVox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SynchroVox">Synchro-Vox</a>.
<ul><li> In a funny inversion, fantastic superpowers and gigantic explosions are generally a <em>lot</em> easier for computers to render than more mundane, everyday movements like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFlowInCGI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFlowInCGI">shirt grabs or brushing one's hair</a>. The latter actions occur only a few times over the course of the movie - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar">Pixar</a>'s animators pointed to the shot where Bob pokes a finger through a hole in his old suit as the single hardest shot to pull off in the entire film by far. This is at least partly because everyone knows exactly what brushing your hair looks like, and when done wrong it looks jarring. By contrast, how many times have you seen a woman turn into a rubber raft or giant parachute in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>?
</li><li> This is also why so many early Pixar films deal with subjects that are easier to animate than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">humans with normal proportions, hair, and clothing</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory">Toys</a> are supposed to look like plastic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ABugsLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ABugsLife">bugs</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FindingNemo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FindingNemo">fish</a> are cartoonish and shiny-skinned, the vast majority of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersInc">monsters</a> (with one or two big exceptions; many articles of the time talked about the work gone into rendering Sully) are hairless and look completely unrealistic anyway. Even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles">The Incredibles</a></em> is steeped in a genre that basically goes hand-in-hand with exaggerated designs and tight spandex. It wasn't until their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ratatouille" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ratatouille">eighth film</a> that they felt comfortable doing an almost entirely human cast (with the only exceptions being covered in fur) wearing normal clothing and in a realistic urban setting for the entire film.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainSindbad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainSindbad">Captain Sindbad</a></em> (not to be confused with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayHarryhausen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayHarryhausen">Ray Harryhausen</a> Sinbad movies), Sinbad must fight an invisible beast in an arena.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkestHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkestHour">The Darkest Hour</a></em> takes this to new heights, depicting a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">invasion of the Earth</a> by invisible aliens.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dreamscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dreamscape">Dreamscape</a></em>, Dennis Quaid's psychic character is said to have telekinesis, and we see a still movie slide of him levitating a small metal ball bearing. If viewers were expecting him to use this at any point in the film to save himself from a dangerous situation, they were disappointed because the movie focuses on his ability to enter dreams instead.
</li><li> In the adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GenerationX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GenerationX">Generation X</a></em>, Chamber (who expels hot plasma from his chest) was replaced with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner">Canon Foreigner</a> Refrax (who melts things with his eyes), Husk (who can shed her skin and make new skin out of different materials) became Buff (a teenage girl with an Arnold Schwarzenegger physique; conveniently, her clothing hides all of this supposed muscle), and Mondo's power to take on the texture of materials through physical contact had no corresponding change in his body's appearance. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MonetStCroix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MonetStCroix">M</a> no longer has the ability to fly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaFinalWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaFinalWars">Godzilla: Final Wars</a></em> has the Xilians (aliens from Planet X) disguised as humans for the express purpose of looking less threatening to Earth's native population. When they inevitably turn on the humans, they keep their human disguises, with one character simply remarking that he likes the outfit. That said, the movie had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustHereForGodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustHereForGodzilla">Godzilla fighting almost every monster that's ever appeared in a Showa-era Godzilla film one after another</a>, so no one really cared.
<ul><li> Later Heisei-era films showed monsters mostly relying on beam attacks, as their impressive-looking suit designs became too bulky to do any physical moves more complex than "clumsy shuffle" and "wave tiny T-rex arms." Easier to just add some laser effects over the footage than find someone capable of fighting in a two-hundred-pound costume.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">Justice League of America</a></em> pilot movie does this for a lot of the characters, but <em>especially</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a>. In the comics, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RingOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RingOfPower">Power Ring</a> is capable of conjuring up anything he can imagine, while in the film, he conveniently sticks to creating easy-to-render items like chainsaws and umbrellas. Yes. Umbrellas. These are expressed by having the actor hold something and then it being given a green glow effect.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheScorpionKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheScorpionKing">The Scorpion King</a> 2</em>, Mathayus fights an invisible giant scorpion in the climax.
</li><li> The low-budget superhero spoof film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSpecials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSpecials">The Specials</a></em> went <em>all the way to the end</em> without showing <em>any</em> powers in use by <em>anyone</em>, reserving those expensive effects for the final moments of the movie (which were more like a curtain call than anything having to do with the plot). This was partially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by turning the question of just what the new girl's powers actually <em>were</em> into something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> Jedi have harnessed the Force that binds the universe together, but their powers are still limited by what was cheap and easy in the 1970s and 1980s, such as making actors repeat things, speaking in voice-over to each other, and "sensing" things. More budget-heavy feats like moving objects and jumping were still pretty affordable. All of this makes the Emperor's Force lightning that much more of a shock when he breaks it out in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>.
</li><li> There's a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a> at play as well. The Force in the original Star Wars was very different from what it later became. Jedi were more like the Bene Gesserit of Dune, with a bunch of mental tricks to enhance their own performance and influence the minds of others, but with no overt power over the physical world. Even Darth Vader choking Admiral Motti was supposed to be a mental compulsion to stop breathing rather than physical strangulation. This is why people like Han Solo think the Force is 'simple tricks and nonsense'. It wasn't until Empire that things like telekinesis and physical enhancement started being added to the Jedi repertoire, making Han's statement seem more out of place with each installment.
</li><li> The original <em>Star Wars</em> also featured very little lightsaber content: there's only four scenes with a lightsaber, and in only one does the lightsaber actually cut something (which also lacks the since-common effect of lightsabers burning their wounds). Pretty much every account claims the original lightsaber props were really fragile and known to crack in two, hence why you have Obi-Wan and Vader's rather stiff kendo-style duel instead of the acrobatic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flynning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flynning">Flynning</a> of later films.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator">The Terminator</a></em>: In the early 80s, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCameron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCameron">an aspiring Canadian director</a> wanted to make a movie about a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar">Robot War</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">post-apocalyptic future</a> after seeing a burning metal skeleton in a nightmare. He couldn't get the necessary budget, so he decided to move the action into the present (saving lots of money on the sets) and clothe the robot in human skin (saving lots of money on animatronics). The rest is Future History.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Storm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Storm">Storm</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JeanGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JeanGrey">Jean Grey</a> both used their powers far more cautiously in the 2000-2006 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFilmSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFilmSeries">X-Men</a></em> trilogy than in their animated or comic versions. Prolonged flight and telekinesis are still very difficult to film. Not to mention beings made of living ice or metal. Iceman doesn't become a full-fledged X-Man until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenTheLastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenTheLastStand">third film</a>, likely just so he won't have to use his powers to their fullest, with ice slides, ice projectiles, and ice armor. (He does learn how to do the ice armor at the end of the third film. For about ten seconds.) Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Colossus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Colossus">Colossus</a> only takes on his metal form <em>just</em> as something is about to hit him or he needs to use his strength.
</li><li> In a non-powers case of this, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Deadpool2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Deadpool2016">Deadpool (2016)</a></em> ends up losing his guns and ammo in time for the final battle. By some accounts, this is because the film had a pretty low budget, enough that a big gunfight at the end would blow it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a></em>:
<ul><li> Tim the Enchanter never gets to show off any of his mighty wizardry powers after his first scene, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">vanishes from the plot not long after</a>. By some accounts, that scene (where he causes a bunch of explosions) was the most expensive one in the whole film.
</li><li> Arthur's power and status as a king is limited by the film's minuscule budget; he travels with a small retinue, we only see his castle in a brief musical number, he only calls upon his army at the very end of the film, and so on. This is written into the film's plot itself, as it's made abundantly clear that few people really respect Arthur's claim as king and they mostly just see him as a bossy weirdo with nice clothing.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFortyFourHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFortyFourHundred">The 4400</a></em>. The vast majority of characters had really, really cheap powers. This got really bad with Isabel. She had all possible abilities... and only really used one, telekinesis. Minor powers used include changing her eye color and making a pool warmer. Yet they kept saying she had many amazing powers. Somewhat compensated for by how original and cool many of these cheap powers were, such as a b-movie director who could see the events of the past exactly, so he figured out the Kennedy assassination and a powerful conspiracy... but channeled them solely into horrible, cheesy, low-budget films.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a></em> is an odd place with this, since it's explicitly set in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>, yet lacks the massive budget those films usually receive:
<ul><li> Donnie Gill a.k.a. Blizzard still has ice powers, but they're not nearly as strong as they are in the comics. While his comic counterpart can generate cold blasts, fire ice projectiles, and conjure massive ice slides, the show's version of Donnie mostly sticks to the old "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiterallyShatteredLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiterallyShatteredLives">Freeze N' Shatter</a>" technique. Oh, and he now needs to be <em>touching</em> his target in order for his powers to work.
</li><li> In the comics, Calvin Zabo/Mister Hyde possesses the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkOut">transform into a massive, muscular beast</a> à la <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheIncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheIncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a>. The show has downplayed any of his physical abilities in favor of making him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a>. He does transform at the end of Season 2, but the transformation is a relatively minor one.
</li><li> The show did a pretty good job on the Absorbing Man, but with one change: The comic version of Absorbing Man is capable of growing to gigantic heights depending on how much mass the object he's absorbed has. The show downplays the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SizeShifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SizeShifter">Sizeshifter</a> aspect by having him mostly absorb smaller objects.
</li><li> Thanks to the limited casting and special effects budget (as well as contract and scheduling stuff), none of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a> (other than Nick Fury) ever show up, despite being referenced <em>constantly</em>. The show was sharply criticized for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedSkiesCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedSkiesCrossover">Red Skies Crossover</a> with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorTheDarkWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorTheDarkWorld">Thor: The Dark World</a></em>, which despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysLie">TV spots to the contrary</a>, had almost nothing to do with the movie. Fans and viewers were expecting to see Coulson and the gang fighting off Dark Elves and CGI beasts; what they got was Coulson and the gang cleaning up some rubble and making a dumb joke about how superheroes never pick up after themselves.
</li><li> Also, despite being a show about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SHIELD">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a>, the organization's trademark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirborneAircraftCarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirborneAircraftCarrier">Helicarriers</a> were off-limits due to being too expensive to show onscreen. The only Helicarrier we ever see is some recycled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">Stock Footage</a> of one of the ones brought down by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFalcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFalcon">The Falcon</a> during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier">Captain America: The Winter Soldier</a></em> and a brief shot of a static Helicarrier under construction.
</li><li> Tellingly, one of the major selling points Marvel made sure to mention in the comic book inspired by the show was that it had no budget or character restrictions. For the first time, fans could see the cast of the show interacting with the likes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MsMarvel2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MsMarvel2014">Ms. Marvel</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a>, and many more.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the worst examples has to be the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> TV series. The producers decided to make it live action (a rather odd decision, given that the target audience was well within the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto">Animation Age Ghetto</a>), so they ended up having to adapt a very imaginative sci-fi book series with the budget of a half hour cable kids' show. As a result, the characters rarely used their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">Voluntary Shapeshifting</a> abilities - even stupidly spending an inordinate amount of time in their normal forms around the Yeerks (whom, by the way, they are supposed to be hiding their identities from). Ax, on the other hand, spent nearly all of his screen time disguised as a human, even when there was no clear reason for him to do this.
<ul><li> There was one especially blatant instance from the show. After capturing the team using a <strong>net</strong>, Visser Three walks up and tells them "How foolish of you to come in human form!" - <em>While in human form himself.</em>
<ul><li> In another episode, Visser Three spends all of his screentime in human form while on the <em>Yeerk mother ship</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The kicker is that K. A. Applegate originally designed the Andalites as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberForeheadAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberForeheadAliens">Rubber-Forehead Aliens</a> to make it easier on a potential television adaption. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">When publishers complained about how generic they were</a>, Applegate turned them into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot">blue centaurs with scorpion tails and four eyes</a> that would be fiendishly difficult to produce onscreen; thus, they only appear as (<em>extremely</em> crappy) animatronic puppets for about five seconds at a time.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em>: Damien Darhk is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer">Evil Sorcerer</a>. His powers were typically limited to telekinetically immobilizing people and performing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicStrangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicStrangle">Psychic Strangle</a>. Both of which require no real special effects and can instead be done solely by the actors. Another trick, telekinetically stopping projectiles in midair, is also fairly cheap; as opposed to fireballs or lightning anyway.
</li><li> Due to budget limitations, Marcus's telescoping fighting staff in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em> was opened and closed mostly off-screen, although they did take care to actually show it open up when it was used for the first time.
</li><li> There <em>were</em> plot-critical reasons for the main Cylons in the retooled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica (2003)</a></em> being human-looking, but there was still an element of "save frakloads of money on having to make CGI robots for every episode". Indeed, this trope took place in the very planning stages; the Cylons were redesigned as human-looking because the creators counted that they could only afford one Cylon suit good enough to convince modern audiences, while CGI was still too expensive to rely on constantly. However, as the miniseries was past and it was time to start filming the main series, the CGI prices had fallen significantly, and they managed to squeeze in more Centurions than they had initially thought possible.
</li><li> Related: The "Vampires Exploding into Dust After Being Staked" effect on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> cost <em>$5,000</em> per use. As a result, the majority of vampires (especially in the first few seasons) are staked <em>just</em> off-screen, with the disintegration sound-effect playing. By the time the show's budget had been raised to a point where they could afford to use it every time (and the cost of CGI had been reduced by a significant figure), vampires had long ceased to be the main threat on the show—which, naturally, let Buffy kill scads of them.
<ul><li> In earlier episodes, when vampires shifted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace">vamp face</a>, the actual shift usually occurred off-screen. As the show's budget increased, vamping out onscreen became more common. Furthermore, in many cases you can tell the shift is something of a "jump cut" between pre-makeup and post-makeup; once Season 2 comes around, the "game face" effect is a more gradual, CGI-based shift.
</li><li> There's an episode of the spinoff <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em>, where Wesley and Gunn fight a two-headed, fire-breathing, twenty-foot tall monster. Neither it nor the battle is shown on screen. This might be because it wasn't particularly crucial to the plot. An earlier episode featured the Haxil Beast, a huge demon that was nonetheless shown on-screen for quite a while.
</li><li> This is done with invisibility in one episode early on in the show's run. We get one quick CGI shot of a floating baseball bat and at one point the invisible character hits another character with a baseball bat... the hand of which is just off-screen.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the seventh season can take the form of anyone that has died and its true form is only seen a couple of times. Quite lucky that Buffy herself has died twice in the show's continuity, which means that Sarah Michelle Gellar could easily double up and appear as the First when they didn't want to stretch the budget by bringing back old cast members for every episode. Likewise since Spike is technically dead as a vampire, James Marsters could likewise play the First more than once too.
</li></ul></li><li> The first three seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em> had numerous stunts involving Prue's telekinesis, but budget cuts lead to her replacement Paige having the ability to remotely teleport objects instead, which turns out to be more efficient given that it's easier to add a few CGI effects than to set up and insure stunts that involve flying through the air. Chris, introduced in the sixth season, also had telekinesis, but rarely used it. Billie, in season eight, ALSO had telekinesis, but rarely threw demons into walls the way Prue did.
<ul><li> This is also supposedly the reason why Piper kept her initial molecular control powers while Prue gained astral projection and Phoebe gained levitation — her special effects were costlier than anyone else's.
</li><li> This is also why Phoebe lost her levitation power, as the harness and insurance for the stunts ended up being too costly.
</li><li> Demons in general became more and more human-looking as the series went on, to save on costuming and make-up.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> is usually contending with low budgets and was, for much of its history, done for desperately small amounts of money. So this tends to come up a lot:
<ul><li> The TARDIS only ever materialized in place in the early days because they didn't have the budget to show their space ship traveling in space (except for a few times) or actually flying. The new series has fixed this somewhat and we've gotten many more scenes of the TARDIS flying, including one where it speeds along next to a car on a highway. The writers do note that that sort of thing "puts a strain on the engines", thus explaining the rarity.
</li><li> The TARDIS' chameleon circuit is a great example. The BBC didn't have the technology in 1963 to make the spaceship invisible, and didn't have the budget to actually show it transforming into things that weren't 1963 police boxes. As you know, this resulted in one of the most iconic science fiction spaceships in the whole of the genre.
</li><li> The Doctor's few special powers are things that can be conveyed easily with solid acting and some basic camera tricks (even live camera tricks, if necessary)  <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperIntelligence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperIntelligence">Super Intelligence</a>, a kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperAwareness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperAwareness">Hyper-Awareness</a>-like sense that allows him to know if he can change the outcome of an event or not, and some limited telepathy, hypnosis and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionControl">Emotion Control</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> that he only uses once in a blue moon, which are usually conveyed by him grabbing someone else's head and looking into their eyes intensely. His most expensive ability is his regeneration ability, which has been achieved in various ways over the show's history such as a malfunctioning visual mixing desk, mixing together shots of actors' faces or CGI. He's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAlien">Human Alien</a>, with his inhumanness generally conveyed by picking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">slightly otherworldly-looking</a> actors who play him with lots of eccentric little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTics">Character Tics</a>.
</li><li> The First Doctor encountered two separate species of invisible aliens at various points when some element of peril was needed and yet too much money had been blown on a serial by that point  notably the Visians on Mira in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E4TheDaleksMasterPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E4TheDaleksMasterPlan">"The Daleks' Master Plan"</a> (a very expensive 12-part <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceOpera">Space Opera</a> serial) and the Refusians in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E6TheArk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E6TheArk">"The Ark"</a> (the first part of which involved live toucans and elephants and some simply gorgeous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatteShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatteShot">Matte Shots</a>). Neither is shown physically interacting with anything, save for the Visian being shown in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibilityFlicker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibilityFlicker">Invisibility Flicker</a> when the Daleks exterminate it. A related invisibility sequence concerns the fate befalling the Doctor in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E7TheCelestialToymaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E7TheCelestialToymaker">"The Celestial Toymaker"</a>, in which the Toymaker is explained to be able to phase the Doctor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsOutToLunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsOutToLunch">in and out of tangibility</a> for his amusement — William Hartnell's health was suffering by that time, and the conceit allowed Hartnell to have more time off if he needed it. Then there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E3TheEdgeOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E3TheEdgeOfDestruction">"The Edge of Destruction"</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottleEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottleEpisode">Bottle Episode</a> in which the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">Negative Space Wedgie</a> is represented by the TARDIS doors opening and closing, leading to the crew to speculate there might be an invisible monster in the TARDIS.
</li><li> The first appearance of the Daleks in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E2TheDaleks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E2TheDaleks">second serial</a> was an early version of this trope. Only two actual moving Daleks are shown at any point, the rest are painted backdrops.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS4E3ThePowerOfTheDaleks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS4E3ThePowerOfTheDaleks">"The Power of the Daleks"</a>, there is a short scene of the Daleks agreeing that (despite the massive army of hundreds and hundreds of Daleks that they have built) they will travel around only in groups of three. This obviously saved the BBC a lot of money on building Dalek props.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E1Galaxy4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E1Galaxy4">"Galaxy 4"</a> ends with the planet that the story takes place on disintegrating. "Can we see the disintegration of the planet on the scanner, Doctor?" asks the companion, Steven. The Doctor answers, "No." No explanation as to why is even given.
</li><li> A common criticism of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E4TheEnemyOfTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E4TheEnemyOfTheWorld">"The Enemy of the World"</a> is that the climactic defeat of the villain is a very rushed sequence of him getting sucked out of the TARDIS into the Vortex. The sequence was intended to go on longer, but the villain is played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatrickTroughton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatrickTroughton">Patrick Troughton</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActingForTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActingForTwo">Acting for Two</a> and the early split-screen effects needed to put both of them on screen at once turned out to be harder and more expensive than the BBC had thought. (Of course, technology has now improved to the point that Clara can talk to a whole army of time-looped versions of herself in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget">No Budget</a> online <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS33ShortClaraAndTheTARDIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS33ShortClaraAndTheTARDIS">minisode</a>.)
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS9E4TheMutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS9E4TheMutants">"The Mutants"</a>, an alien transforms through several stages from a humanoid, through a lobster-like creature, to a glowing, floating alien. For most of the transformation, the camera shows a close-up of his hand, only requiring work from makeup and costumes for the hand rather than full-body work that would only be seen for a few seconds.
</li><li> The TARDIS is at the very least the size of a city but is likely infinite, and shifts around from time to time depending on its own whims. We spent very little time there in the old series, only visiting some corridors ("played" by an abandoned hospital) and a handful of rooms. Even in the new series, we rarely see much further than the main control room  we've seen some corridors, a swimming pool, a wardrobe, a library and part of its processors, but not much else. Most of what we know about its insides comes from the dialogue and from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a>, which has no budget constraints and thus can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWonderland">The Wonderland</a>  the novelisation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS17E6Shada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS17E6Shada">"Shada"</a>, for example, contained a scene where Chris spends a night in the TARDIS guest suite and discovers that his "bath" is an Olympic-sized swimming pool with clawed feet on the end.
</li><li> Kamelion the shapeshifting robot in Season 21 is an interesting example; in this case they <em>had</em> the special effect (an actual remote controlled robot of apparently hideous complexity), but following the death of its inventor, they'd no idea how to <em>use</em> it. As a result, Kamelion either took human form or just didn't appear. Usually the latter.
</li><li> Season 26 of the original series usually began episodes with the Doctor and Ace coming out of the TARDIS. One episode did show them inside working at the console, but the rest of the console room was in darkness. The reason is they'd scrapped the set and didn't want to pay for a new one.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS29E8HumanNature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS29E8HumanNature">"Human Nature"</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS29E9TheFamilyOfBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS29E9TheFamilyOfBlood">"The Family of Blood"</a> gives its villains an invisible spaceship, convenient for both camouflage and the FX budget.
</li></ul></li><li> Partially due to the series' age and also because of its budget, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ElChapulinColorado" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ElChapulinColorado">El Chapulín Colorado</a></em> features several examples of this trope:
<ul><li> The titular character shrinking due to the Chiquitolina pills is shown through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChromaKey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChromaKey">Chroma Key</a>. In earlier seasons, you didn't even see El Chapulín shrinking - he'd rapidly crouch so that he'd get off-screen, and then he appears when fully shrunk. The opposite also applied in whenever he returned to his regular size.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> is shown through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StyrofoamRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StyrofoamRocks">Styrofoam Props</a>. The same happens in an episode featuring a liquid that made objects much weaker. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeachEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeachEpisode">Beach Episode</a>, an actor poses for a photo by lifting a styrofoam rock in one hand, as if he did have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>.
</li><li> Other situations such as teleportation, objects popping into existence <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">or multiple people getting out of a place way too small for them</a> happen through very obvious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopTrick">Stop Tricks</a>.
</li><li> Characters being frozen by El Chapulín's Chicharra Paralizadora is made by the actors actually standing still.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ForeverKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ForeverKnight">Forever Knight</a></em> actually used on-screen flying effects in the first season, but because of safety and budget issues, decided to imply Nick's flight by just having him lifted up before cutting to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/POVCam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/POVCam">in-flight viewpoint</a> and then to him "landing" at his destination.
</li><li> Janet from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodPlace">The Good Place</a></em> is a construct with the most extraordinary powers a sitcom can buy: she knows literally everything (as easy as writing dialogue), can teleport to anyone who says her name (she appears between cuts with a little <em>bing</em>), and can conjure up any object (the object appears in her hands between cuts). Downplayed with Michael's powers, reflected as holograms with smartphone-like interfaces, and averted with Shawn, whose cocooning and uncocooning is shown in full. As the series continues, this trope appears less and less; Janet usually still appears between cuts for tradition's sake, but there are a few shots where she visibly disappears or her objects pop out of thin air.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/H2OJustAddWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/H2OJustAddWater">H₂O: Just Add Water</a></em> doesn't ever show Emma actually freezing something. She points her hands at whatever she's freezing and squints really hard. Then we get a CGI shot of ice molecules appearing (the same one is used each time) and it cuts to the object already frozen. Rikki's power is also very easy to simulate since it involves boiling water done via smoke effects. Cleo's power on the other hand does require plenty of CGI effects which is probably why you rarely see her using her water manipulation to lift objects unless they're inside the water. Also they do have a CGI effect for the girls turning into mermaids - their body turns to water and then you see them with the tails but more often you'll either just see them jumping into the water and they'll already be in mermaid form when it cuts to an underwater shot or they'll fall to the floor out of shot (with the transformation sound effect) and it'll cut to them on the floor with the tail.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> inspired the creation of this page from its relentless use of the trope. One of the suggested names for this page was a takeoff on the <em>Heroes</em> tagline: "Ordinary People, Budget-Straining Abilities".
<ul><li> Nathan Petrelli only did supersonic flight twice in all of season 1, and once in season 2. This is odd, since West (who also flies) has taken off more than once in season 2. It may be possible that they assigned one of the most expensive ones to Nathan because he is somewhat embarrassed by them. West really floats instead of flies, which is a much cheaper special effect than Nathan's supersonic flight.
</li><li> Niki/Jessica has super strength, but viewers more often just see the results of her strength, and not her using it.
</li><li> By far, the most commonly used power on the show is telepathy. It just requires Matt Parkman to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PstandardPsychicPstance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PstandardPsychicPstance">squint, give somebody the crazy eyes, or tilt his head and stare off into space.</a> As said by the actor who plays him, "I have the power... of <em>LEANING</em>".
</li><li> Micah gets to use his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technopath">Technopath</a> abilities every few episodes. He puts his hand on a prop and squints.
</li><li> The plots always seem to demand readily available precogs, most of whom just have to paint (with white out eyes), and some of whom just get odd dreams which is as easy as shooting another scene and screwing with the filter.
</li><li> This is the main reason why we hardly ever see Hiro perform <em>short</em> teleports — longer ones let them change the whole scene, which is easier to do believably.
</li><li> Sylar and Peter both had lots and lots of powers, but you'd usually just see telekinesis from Sylar and a smattering of cheaper powers (such as teleports, mind reading, floating) from Peter. The expensive ones, like radiation and freezing, were usually saved for big-budget finales and premieres. Showdowns between Peter and Sylar consist of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightUnscene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightUnscene">flashing lights seen through the cracks around a closed door</a>.
</li><li> It's <em>extremely</em> telling that the characters use their powers far more often and more creatively in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">online comics</a>. We also see many more new characters in the comics with more (for want of a better word) "trippy" abilities that'd be hard to visualize with the show's budget (a plant-man, a woman who can literally rearrange your face, a guy who clones himself through "budding", and so on).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Inhumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Inhumans">Inhumans</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackBolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackBolt">Black Bolt</a> is made into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalWimp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalWimp">Adaptational Wimp</a>. While he still has his trademark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout">sonic scream</a>, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> is greatly reduced (taking him down from being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick">Flying Brick</a> to a guy who gets overpowered by human police officers) and he cannot fly or fire electron blasts.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MedusaMarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MedusaMarvelComics">Medusa</a> still has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrehensileHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrehensileHair">Prehensile Hair</a>, but her head is forcibly shaved in the first episode, effectively leaving her powerless for the remainder of the series.
</li><li> Auran has yellow skin and large, bat-like ears in the comics, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDontLookLikeYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDontLookLikeYou">neither of which are retained for her TV design</a>. This results in her looking exactly like a normal human woman, and thus eliminates the need for makeup or pricey facial prosthetics.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jekyll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jekyll">Jekyll</a></em>: Hyde's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> ability requires very little in the way of effects except perhaps for the odd cut to reveal that, while a character's back was turned, Hyde has warped in front of him. The one scene where he demonstrates it by daring an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victim</a> to attack him with a knife consists of the camera spinning around him real fast and ending with him behind the victim.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Kaamelott" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Kaamelott">Kaamelott</a></em>:
<ul><li> Given an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> justification: Kaamelott's enchanter Merlin is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneptMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneptMage">Inept Mage</a> extraordinaire, so every time he uses his powers, it's as underwhelming as the special effects can make it. The show isn't entirely run on Coconut Effects — Excalibur always glows when held by someone with an exceptional destiny — but they are so sparingly used as to be forgivable.
</li><li> Giant monsters are often just offscreen. One episode has a dragon flying around at treetop level, its only onscreen presence manifesting by taking a dump on two of the knights.
</li></ul></li><li> Present in several <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em> series. There is almost always at least one attack, form, or series gimmick that's too CG intensive to be used more than once or twice throughout the entire show (and the movies, where the budget is less tight); meanwhile, forms that require little to no additional SFX budget, like sword and unarmed combat-based ones, get most of the screentime. Examples of this trope across the franchise include:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoverBoard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoverBoard">Hover Board</a> mode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderAgito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderAgito">Kamen Rider Agito</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBike">Cool Bike</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKabuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKabuto">Kamen Rider Kabuto</a></em> gives all of the Riders and Worms the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill">Clock Up</a>, which is actually a pretty good special effect during the first quarter of the show, but is almost completely forgotten in its last 20 episodes or so.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderOOO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderOOO">Kamen Rider OOO</a></em>'s Gatakiriba Combo, whose main power is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoppelgangerAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoppelgangerAttack">Doppelgänger Attack</a>, is only used twice in the show.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderWizard">Kamen Rider Wizard</a></em> manages to actually avoid this for the most part, including making frequent use of effects like Copy that just two years previously were devastating to a budget. However, even Wizard can't handle the expense and difficulty of filming fights using All Dragon Style, a part-costume part-CGI form that's only used twice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderGaim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderGaim">Kamen Rider Gaim</a></em> gives Suika Arms, a watermelon-themed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Mini-Mecha</a>, a recharge period with no clear timer to justify not using it often.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDrive">Kamen Rider Drive</a></em> gains the ability to use all 27 of his previous powers in sets of three in his Type Tridoron form, of which he only uses 9. Most of the individual powers themselves only appear once, or in some cases never get used at all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderGhost">Kamen Rider Ghost</a></em>'s Riders and their opponents all tend to forget that they have the ability to fly and become intangible. On top of this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LudwigVanBeethoven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LudwigVanBeethoven">Beethoven Damashii</a>, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalAssassin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalAssassin">fights with music</a>, usually gets sidelined in favor of forms that use weapons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderBuild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderBuild">Kamen Rider Build</a></em> uses his TurtleWatch Best Match entirely offscreen to avoid the expense of having to make a costume and effects for it. His later Genius Form is similarly supposed to be able to use all 60 powers of his previous forms, but during the show only uses Diamond, and that only a single time.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow">Legends of Tomorrow</a></em> has already served up a number of examples, most notably in the effects for Firestorm and the mysterious way the winged characters' wings appear and disappear depending on the angle of the shot.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Firestorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Firestorm">Firestorm</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Vixen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Vixen">Vixen</a> are the hardest hit. Stein and Jax are almost always separated so they can't fuse into the expensive (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">overpowered</a>) Firestorm. Meanwhile, Vixen pretty exclusively uses her ability to channel the power of <em>any and all animals</em> to punch things with gorilla strength. (Her case is worst when compared to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Vixen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Vixen">the animated web series</a>, where her granddaughter, who has the same powers, switches from one animal ability to another in rapid succession throughout any battle.)
</li><li> Captain Cold's cold gun usually sends people flying back, but only leaves people or things visibly frozen if the plot needs for a frozen person or object to be interacted with.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Legion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Legion">Legion</a></em> got <em>creative</em> with this. Most of the characters' powers don't require extensive FX or are entirely mental (Syd's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip">body swapping</a>, Cary and Kerry's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synchronization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synchronization">Synchronization</a>, Ptonomy's memory), so when David Haller needs to go head-to-head with a psychic of similar stature, how do you depict a proper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleInTheCenterOfTheMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleInTheCenterOfTheMind">Battle in the Center of the Mind</a> without blowing up the budget? The answer: Depict the psychic struggles metaphorically through <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanceOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanceOff">Dance</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessThroughInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessThroughInsanity">Battles.</a></strong>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark">Lois &amp; Clark</a></em> became notorious for one aspect of this around the time of its second series. The show's about Superman, right? And how does he get around? He flies... except that flying is FX-heavy to depict on screen and can involve actors literally hanging around in uncomfortable harnesses for hours. So the L&amp;C production team tried to save money by depicting Superman flying away from a location by having the actor swirl his cape around to fill the camera view and adding a stock sound effect. Later, they stopped bothering with the cape swirl and just had him leave the shot, followed by the sound. It worked much better.
</li><li> The hero of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Manimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Manimal">Manimal</a></em> could (implicitly) turn into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism">any animal</a>. Unfortunately, Stan Winston only made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationSequence">Transformation Sequence</a> effects for a hawk and a panther. He also made a large snake transformation, which was seen on-screen a big total of <em>once</em>. Any other transformations happened off-screen.
</li><li> The series finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MANTIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MANTIS">M.A.N.T.I.S.</a></em> pitted the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a>-clad hero against an INVISIBLE giant killer dinosaur.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008">Merlin</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first episode, Merlin can use his magic to slow down time fairly easily. Since then, however, he's only been shown to do it once. This is presumably because it is hard to film. (It's also illegal in-universe, so it's not going to happen a whole lot anyway.)
</li><li> Another example is when two assassins use shape-shifting amulets to impersonate a pair of knights and enter a tournament. After they are killed, Gaius removes the amulets <em>before</em> removing their helmets and revealing their true identities, preventing the need for any face-changing special effects.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Misfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Misfits">Misfits</a></em> thrives on this trope. Of the five main characters, four of them have abilities that require practically no effects (time-rewinding and telepathy only need a rewound camera shot and a voiceover, respectively; sex pheromones and immortality need even less effort) and the fifth (invisibility) only needs a brief effect to show it happening, which usually occurs off-screen. Other powers featured so far include mind control, really fast-acting alopecia, de-aging, uncontrollable rage and becoming a dog (who still looks human), none of which require any effects whatsoever.
<ul><li> Furthermore, the invisibility is almost always shown from Simon's perspective, and he can still see himself. So far there's been one instance of the other characters perceiving objects moving on their own.
</li><li> Not to mention most only used their power once per four episodes. In the alternate Nazi reality episode, we only got to see one using and had to guess if the others even had theirs.
</li></ul></li><li> Mocked in the "Mr Neutron is Missing" episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus">Monty Python's Flying Circus</a></em>, where the episode ends before the story is resolved because the studio runs out of money. Shortly before the credits run, the narrator tries to explain what was going to happen, and how expensive the various scenes were going to be. For a more conventional usage, the only thing Mr Neutron does with superpowers that allegedly could be used to destroy the world is turn a frumpy middle-aged housewife into a slightly better dressed middle-aged housewife.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NoHeroics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NoHeroics">No Heroics</a></em> is about heroes sitting around and chatting instead of using their powers to fight crime.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime">Once Upon a Time</a></em> only has the Wicked Witch of the West fly on her broom once, the rest of the time appearing out of thin air. Presumably because this is easier to set up with a CGI smoke effect rather than using green screen and insure Zelena flying through the air. Other than that, other characters use their powers freely and easily.
<ul><li> Played with in the musical episode "The Song in Your Heart." During her solo song, "Wicked Always Wins," Zelina hops on her broom and rides around the set, clearly in a pre-set arc but quickly hops off and carries it around the set.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em>, one question even the show's youngest fans frequently asked during Megazord battles is why the rangers didn't disassemble the Megazord and fight individually more often (this was especially prevalent when they were fighting multiple monsters at once or an individual Zord had a useful ability that the Megazord itself didn't, such as the ability to fly.) The obvious reason is that it's easier to film with a guy in a foam rubber suit than to design and work with multiple props for each individual Zord (some seasons only showed individual zords through a few repeated scenes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">Stock Footage</a>.) It's telling that, on the odd occasion where the Zords had individual humanoid forms (such as the Shogunzords, Super Zeo Zords, or the RescueZords), we saw the rangers fighting individually a <em>lot</em> more.
<ul><li> This also applies to other bipedal Zords that could be portrayed by a human in a rubber suit such as the Dragonzord and the Mighty Morphin T-Rex.
</li><li> The bigger the Zord is (combined or not), the more likely that it has to move with wheels if it can move more than a few steps at all. This is because the foam rubber suit just becomes too heavy for any singular stuntman to move around in and the producers don't want to spend money on CGI.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HikoninSentaiAkibaranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HikoninSentaiAkibaranger">Hikonin Sentai Akibaranger</a></em> shows the alternative. Watch the series and you'll notice that, for a Super Sentai parody/installment, there are very few instances where they use the show's zord, the Itassha Robo. Not only does the Itassha Robo have a very odd design that'd be challenging for a suit actor, but it's very small by the standards of sentai mecha, meaning that model cities are off-limits (and would probably blow the budget even if the zord were larger). As a result, it's always portrayed with CGI, which is expensive enough that it's only showed in a couple episodes.
</li></ul></li><li> Later seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap">Quantum Leap</a></em>'s budget cuts caused the famous mirror reveal to be a one-camera, Sam-to-mirror-to-Sam panned shot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em> was guilty of this where Clark was concerned. While his powers were mostly physical, so not <em>too</em> budget straining, there was a reason that he very rarely flew and didn't actually master the power until the finale.
<ul><li> This also had an effect on which characters they could use or what they could do with them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid">Darkseid</a> was famously reimagined as a non-corporeal entity that possessed others since the show didn't have the budget to satisfyingly depict him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerkisFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerkisFolk">Serkis Folk</a> or a practical rubber monster.
</li><li> This is why the sequel comic, <em>Smallville Season 11</em>, proved so popular. It not only featured Clark <em>finally</em> cutting loose and using his powers in ways the show couldn't afford, but also had him interact with characters who could not have been done properly on television, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GreenLantern">John Stewart and the Green Lantern Corps</a>, or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Monitors</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Not quite a superpower, but watch <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> enough, and you'll notice almost every time the Gate is opened on Earth, it's either <em>just</em> off screen, behind the iris, or one of the stock shots they probably filmed a decade ago.
<ul><li> The "kawoosh" was made by hanging an airplane turbine over a pool and filming the resulting effect underwater. Not the cheapest effect to reproduce repeatedly. By later episodes, they could've CGIed it, but had no reason to, as the thing ends so quickly that no one notices it's the same effect. The crew did, however, make sure they set up multiple cameras and got many shots of the "kawoosh" to maximize their use of a hard-to-reproduce effect.
</li><li> Also, for some reason, you would almost never see the gate <em>close</em>. Again, it was usually stock footage of one of the times we saw it in the premiere, but you don't even see that every day. The overwhelming majority of the time, the gate closing consists of the sound being heard an instant after the camera cuts away from the open gate.
</li><li> There are also only two "full" Stargates built for the show; every other one seen is made of laminated cardboard and thus shown face on at all times.
</li><li> The transforming helmets Ra and his soldiers used in the movie also received a significant downgrade in the show — while in the movie they were fully articulated masks that could fold up and disappear into the rest of the headdress, in the show they were big, mostly-hollow helmets that "transformed" by a little slot opening up to let you see the character's eyes while the ENTIRE snake head just pointed up awkwardly into the air. On the few occasions the full transformation happened, it was entirely offscreen. That could also have been the reason they went with the more spacious serpent helmets instead of the Horus (eagle) helmets. (Mind you, we did get to see the Horus guard helmets' full transformation on rare occasion - as in, exactly twice ever.)
</li><li> Also, in the film, the helmets had a lot of moving parts, such as the "ears" and beak making small movements that further illustrated how they were never even suspected as being people in masks - everything about the masked faces moved as if alive. In the show, even the Horus masks are perfectly still.
</li><li> This is parodied in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a> <em>Wormhole X-Treme!</em>, where the producer keeps clamping down on the writers' great ideas by pointing out how expensive they are to film. When the script calls for the shot of a large spaceship descending, the producer demands that they simply show a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReactionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReactionShot">Reaction Shot</a> from the actors. This ends up being subverted when an actual spaceship majestically descends through the clouds right in the middle of the shoot. Martin tells the stunned cameraman to keep shooting.
</li></ul></li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> tries to avoid this kind of thing as often as it can, a few exceptions stand out:
<ul><li> Over the course of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a>,</em> the ship's ability to separate the drive section from the saucer section was seldom seen after the first few episodes, even though there were numerous times it might have come in handy for various reasons. In addition to money and pacing issues, it was also not such a hot idea to change the iconic shape of the series's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">Cool Ship</a>.
<ul><li> Most of the times they showed the saucer separation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">the effect looked exactly the same</a> as it did in the first instance.
</li></ul></li><li> Gene Roddenberry pre-empted this trope by deliberately adding a scene in the Enterprise's engine room in the premiere. He did this to justify the large expense in building the set. Otherwise, the engine room set might never have been built.
</li><li> Odo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> and other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">shapeshifting creatures</a> constantly hang around in humanoid form and rarely seem to change their shape in moments when it would be helpful. Most of Odo's transformations <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">take place off-screen</a>, obviously because the special effects cost a small fortune at the time. Odo even spends most of a season without the ability to shapechange, and was given a backstory that made him understandably reluctant to use the ability in front of others. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid">Peter David</a> acknowledges the problem in the introduction of his <em>DS9</em> novel <em>The Siege</em> and notes that he's unrestrained by special effects budgets. As promised, the novel itself features Odo in a crazy mad number of shapeshifting instances.
</li><li> The eponymous character from the DS9 episode "Melora" is an alien from a low gravity world and can float and self-propel in a low gravity environment. She was originally intended to be the primary science officer for DS9, but this was canceled due to the difficulty and expense it would take for her to be in every episode. She was turned into a one-shot crewman and we instead got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm">Lieutenant Jadzia Dax</a>. Notably, Melora did become a regular character in the book series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekTitan">Star Trek: Titan</a></em>, which didn't have to worry about budgetary constraints.
</li><li> Occasionally, this can work out for the best: The iconic <em>Star Trek</em> transporter itself was invented to save on doing expensive landing sequences every episode. Ironically enough, and truer to the spirit of this trope, it was still the most expensive visual effect to do on the show. So in the final season, the camera <em>panned away</em> from the transporter effect while the noise was still being played so that the audience would still be clued in on what was going on. Although digital effects and bigger budgets made costs more trivial, this was still done in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> series all the way to <em>Voyager</em> from time to time. <em>Enterprise</em>'s final season returned to the "off-screen transport" effect (even though these episodes often used visual effects much more complicated and expensive) as a subtle hint to the viewership that this was indeed the final season, mirroring the final season of the original series.
<ul><li> In "Is There In Truth No Beauty?" Spock dons the red anti-Medusan visor when beaming the ambassador and Miranda Jones off the ship despite there being no in-story reason for it. Why? So they can re-use the expensive red-shifted transporter shot from when they beamed aboard.
</li></ul></li><li> By a similar count, it's not hard to peg that phasers were designed with the settings of "person slumps over unharmed" and "person vanishes in flash of light" due to this trope. Later shows often have them acting like more traditional sci-fi beam weapons.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">the original Trek</a> episode "Let This Be Your Last Battlefield," the two natives of Cheron arrived via <em>invisible ship</em> (no, they didn't say "cloaked" or anything that'd make it sound less silly) so it wouldn't have to be shown.
</li><li> Every version of <em>Trek</em> has done space battles where the camera stays on the bridge, and we hear the weapons being fired and a report about damage done to the enemy ship, without seeing it on the viewscreen or an exterior shot (and only a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarTrekShake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarTrekShake">Star Trek Shake</a> or two to signify the damage done to the <em>Enterprise</em>).
</li><li> The first series had Coconut <em>politics</em>. The reason that Klingons were a more frequent problem for the crew of the Enterprise than the Romulans is because the pointy ear tips made the Romulan costumes significantly more expensive than the Klingon ones. Ironically, the later alteration of Klingons into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberForeheadAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberForeheadAliens">Rubber-Forehead Aliens</a> made them into the more expensive choice—but due to their more frequent use making them a more iconic Trek alien, they still saw more screen time than Romulans.
</li><li> <em>The Enterprise Incident</em> had an off-hand mention of the Romulans being reported to use Klingon ships to get more mileage out of the rather expensive D7-class model.
</li><li> <em>Wrath of Khan</em> does a good job of integrating into the plot why Khan spends most of the movie in a stolen Starfleet ship, but it certainly didn't hurt that it meant they could reuse the already-built Enterprise bridge set by just moving some chairs around, especially after the preceding film had proved so notoriously expensive.
</li></ul></li><li> Many Disney shows have similarly "special" effects, even the non-fantasy genre ones. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSuiteLifeOfZackAndCody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSuiteLifeOfZackAndCody">The Suite Life on Deck</a></em> had the owner of the ship drugged and sent in a balloon. And then later someone got away in a plastic bubble. The plastic bubble was a giant beach ball rolled off stage with nobody in it, and the flying balloon appeared to be done with a blue-screen chair and with characters looking up a lot and voiceover.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supergirl2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supergirl2015">Supergirl (2015)</a>,</em> Kara takes to the skies frequently but Martian shapeshifting gets the coconut treatment. You'll never see the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MartianManhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MartianManhunter">Martian Manhunter</a> use his shapeshifting powers to the same extent he does in comics or animation, taking on forms like dinosaurs and giant snakes and such. Instead, he's strictly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick">Flying Brick</a> in combat, with shapeshifting used exclusively to allow him to spend most of his time looking like his actor (even in scenes with only people who know who he is.) At one point, he and Supergirl are helping some renegade White Martians who want to overthrow their genocidal kin. <em>Kara is the only non-Martian present</em> and yet everyone takes on human forms because... reasons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> gets around a lot of budget problems by giving practically every creature the ability to transform into or possess a human. Angels apparently have enormous inhuman forms, but humans are incapable of perceiving them without their eyes burning out, and to interact with things on Earth they have to take human hosts. Demons are occasionally briefly seen as black smoke, but mostly possess humans and give them weird eye colors. Then there are the more obtrusive examples, like werewolves who look like humans with long nails, fangs, and weird eyes, some kind of spider monster that somehow looked like a human with a messed up face, and most notably the time they fought <em>dragons</em> with the convenient ability to look human almost all the time (although their draconic forms did appear briefly).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatMitchellAndWebbLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatMitchellAndWebbLook">That Mitchell and Webb Look</a></em> has this in the "Angel Summoner and BMX Bandit" sketch, where Angel Summoner's powers are depicted as him raising his arms and staff while half the screen is covered in a glow effect. The angels he summons are never actually shown onscreen, unless you count the invisible angels he uses to try to make BMX Bandit feel useful. Each time he uses his powers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome">they just cut to the end,</a> with all the criminals having been easily captured. Of course, the fact that Angel Summoner easily winning the day is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">Foregone Conclusion</a> to the point that the audience doesn't even need to see it is a big part of the joke.
</li><li> Extremely apparent in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionAdaptation">Live-Action Adaptation</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTick2001" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTick2001">The Tick (2001)</a></em>. Because of budget constraints, the show was not allowed to actually show any of the superhero characters <em>ever doing anything superheroic.</em> They would just stand around and talk about it later or do everything offscreen. This made it seem less like a superhero sitcom and more like a bizarre <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em> spinoff where everyone was constantly in gaudy costumes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Titans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Titans">Titans</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Starfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Starfire">Starfire</a> is changed so that she only gains her iconic comic appearance (flaming hair, golden-orange skin and glowing green eyes) when she's actively using her starbolt powers. Conveniently, this means that she looks exactly like a normal human woman for the majority of each episode's runtime (with some episodes not having her transform <em>at all</em>), saving the show from having to constantly spend money on costly CGI or makeup effects. She also lacks her trademark ability to fly.
</li><li> Beast Boy suffers from the same problem as Odo from <em>Deep Space 9</em>. His comic counterpart is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shapeshifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shapeshifter">Shapeshifter</a> who can transform into any animal he can think of, while the TV version of Beast Boy could only morph into a tiger for the entirety of the first season. He later gained the ability to also turn into a snake in the Season 2 premier, but still mostly just uses his tiger form for budgetary reasons.
</li></ul></li><li> The 1980s miniseries/series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/V1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/V1983">V (1983)</a></em> has reptilian aliens who wear clever disguises to pass as human. And, since reptile-face makeup is expensive and hard on the actors, the aliens wear their clever disguises even aboard their spaceships when no humans are around to see. Also, in <em>V: The Series</em>, the Visitors lost the reverb effect added to their voices in both mini-series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WizardsOfWaverlyPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WizardsOfWaverlyPlace">Wizards of Waverly Place</a></em> somehow manages to have the worst of both worlds. Despite centering around a trio of wizards in training, who you'd think would be using magic as often as possible to practice, they generally only use a couple of effects per episode, and those effects due to budget constraints look very very cheap.
<ul><li> In episode 8, the cast get a dragon which has been made to look like a dog so that he is allowed to be seen in the mortal world. He does occasionally fly and breathe fire, but always appears as a dog and is never shown as a dragon, even when only among wizards.
</li></ul></li><li> Episode one of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWorstWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWorstWitch">The Worst Witch</a></em> has Ethel talking to Mildred from her broomstick, which is only hovering a couple of feet off the ground - and the end of the broom just offscreen so it could be pushed by a trailer. Elsewhere a lot of the show's spells involve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvoluntaryShapeshifting">Involuntary Shapeshifting</a> or things appearing out of thin air. Though they do have rather obvious green screen effects to show the girls flying on their brooms.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder4');">    Radio </div><div class="folder" id="folder4" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In the script for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompetenceInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompetenceInc">Sirius Cybernetics Corporation</a> Complaints Department company song is described as being performed by "a choir of over two million robots... exactly a flattened fifth [tritone] out of tune" and the FX description suggests "IT WILL SOUND MORE GHASTLY THAN YOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE". The version in the radio omits the exact number of robots and instead is just six people from the Radiophonic Workshop corridor singing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodToneDeaf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodToneDeaf">quite poorly</a> through a vocoder with a slightly detuned backing. It is pretty ghastly, but nowhere near as bad as Douglas Adams wanted, on the grounds that it's simply impossible for a choir of two million to sound intelligible, and that's before you process it with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoboSpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoboSpeak">Robo Speak</a> effects and detune it by a tritone.
<ul><li> Similarly, when the radio series was adapted to television, the large battle fleet and the shapeshifting admiral who became a copy of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal, became a single ship that's going to dive into a sun as part of a rock band's pyrotechnics. Despite being unencumbered by the limitations of a special-effects budget, Douglas Adams decided to go with the latter version in the novel continuity, presumably because it was funnier. (And also, according to some sources, because the whole Haggunenon sequence was largely John Lloyd's, and Adams didn't want to use it in a book with just his name on the cover.)

For example, Gali performing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNuke">Nova Blast</a> and crushing the entire realm of Kharzani with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantWallOfWateryDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantWallOfWateryDoom">Giant Wall of Watery Doom</a> in a written web serial, but only doing a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FloatingWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FloatingWater">Floating Water</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">Healing Hands</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>.
<ul><li> In <em>Bionicle 2</em>, none of the Toa can be seen using their elemental powers (save for the ending, when they focus them into an unspectacular but shiny beam), because they've depleted them off-screen, while in <em>Bionicle 3</em>, they don't use <em>any</em> kind of power (element or mask-related), because they have been mutated into forms that don't support these powers. Again, the only way they do use their elemental powers is via colored energy spinners, which are far easier to animate.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DoctorHorriblesSingAlongBlog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DoctorHorriblesSingAlongBlog">Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog</a></em> includes several instances of potentially expensive stuff happening offscreen, most notably the disastrous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeRay">Freeze Ray</a> test run during which Captain Hammer throws a car at the title character's head. Fortunately, the writing and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilPatrickHarris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilPatrickHarris">Neil Patrick Harris</a>' performance make Dr. Horrible commenting on these events <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">much more entertaining</a> than actually seeing them would have been. In Act III the "Freeze Ray" stops time, so it consists, essentially, of Nathan Fillion holding very, very still. The Death Ray presumably would have been the target slumping over dead <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (however, since it explodes rather than actually operating as intended, this effect probably was considerably more expensive)</span>. Neither of these is a particularly expensive effect; you just need to have the actor point the prop and add some beam effects. This also applies to Moist's superpower of, well, making things wet.
</li><li> Used to great effect in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AVeryPotterMusical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AVeryPotterMusical">A Very Potter Musical</a></em> and its sequel. Floo Powder consists of running in a circle shouting "Floo Powder Power!", while Portkeys are running in a circle shouting "Portkey!" Disapparating involves shouting "Disapparate!" and running offstage while everyone looks confused about where you went.
<div class="indent">"Magic. Ahh." <em>(shields eyes)</em>
</div><ul><li> The Jelly-Legs Jinx works similarly.
</li></ul><div class="indent">"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">I can't ''believe'' the counter-curse was just 'Unjellify!'.</a>"
</div><ul><li> In the films, the conjoined Voldemort/Quirrell was portrayed using CGI. In this show, it's portrayed by... the two actors standing back-to-back beneath a gigantic robe.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HolyMusicalBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HolyMusicalBatman">Holy Musical B@man!</a></em>: In the great Star Kid tradition, Batman's jet is represented by a small model that goes over his shoulders, and Superman's flight is achieved either through Jim Povolo carrying him or Brian Holden sticking his arms out and making whooshing noises like a five-year-old.
</li><li> Most of the CGI in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Noob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Noob">Noob</a></em> is made by a single person, which basically means all magic users are mostly seen using some variation of shooting balls of light and/or producing force fields, no matter what their class is supposed to be. There's notably a summoner that never summons the creatures that she has under her command <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">according to other media</a>.
</li><li> Used in the <em>Skullduggery</em> episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheSpoonyExperiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheSpoonyExperiment">The Spoony Experiment</a></em>, with a magician (played by Spoony) breaking into the room, preparing a magic trick, only to cut to Spoony reacting with horror as it cuts to the magician, now in the form of the Headless from Ultima Underworld. It's a means of parodying the use of cuts, both regular and jump, to facilitate the "magic acts" by the magician in the film.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/UltraFastPony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/UltraFastPony">Ultra Fast Pony</a></em>. The episode "The Cheesen One" introduces the superhero Mutation, who never speaks and has the ability to silence everyone and everything around her. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a> lampshades the fact that she's really just making the editor's job a lot easier.
<div class="indent"><em>[Mutation rescues a bunch of ponies in complete silence.]</em> <br/><strong>Caption:</strong> BEST! SUPERPOWER! EVER! <br/><strong>Rainbow Dash:</strong> Wow. I'm not sure if we're getting worse at editing these videos, or we're just getting lazier. Probably both.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/CarmillaTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/CarmillaTheSeries">Carmilla the Series</a></em> depicts Carmilla's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> by the reactions of other characters (Kirsch brought to his knees after a light hit, Laura unable to move a bag Carmilla lifted effortlessly, etc.), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> is done with the same "sped-up footage of a character walking" that shows like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood">True Blood</a></em> use. There's also a neat little teleportation that Carmilla does once, but because the lights are out all the audience sees is a puff of black smoke. It's all rather nicely done, considering the near-nonexistent budget.
</li><li> An essay on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/StardestroyerDotNet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/StardestroyerDotNet">Stardestroyer Dot Net</a> jokingly discusses the difference between how a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> battle scenario would play out in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">a fanboyish fantasy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">a realistic outcome</a>, and an actual episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeepSpaceNine">Deep Space Nine</a>.</em> When dealing with one scenario (a pitched battle with a ground-based invasion, smaller craft dogfighting each other, Imperial walkers, and legions of troops), it notes that the "actual episode" solution would be to simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightUnscene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightUnscene">not show the battle at all</a>, since a huge battle scene would blow the budget to smithereens. Therefore, the episode plot would be rewritten to instead have the USS Defiant clear the way for the ground invasion by having it face off against an easier-to-model orbital weapons platform, and then toss in a throwaway line about Klingon transports handling the ground invasion (which isn't too far off from the actual episode "Tears of the Prophets").

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder7');">    Western Animation </div><div class="folder" id="folder7" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Parodied also in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Freakazoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Freakazoid">Freakazoid!</a></em>, in "Tomb of Invisibo", featuring an invisible bad guy with a not-invisible staff. The announcer even let the watchers know that the following segment was made when low on budget. Then the villain's staff appeared suspended on a fishing line for a while. ("The following special effects are not scary, please pretend that they are"). After a few scenes of this, the announcer declares that the executives were shamed into raising the budget, and the invisibility is done "properly" from that point on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GreenLanternTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GreenLanternTheAnimatedSeries">Green Lantern: The Animated Series</a></em> tends to re-use the same constructs over and over, such as Kilowog's trusty hammer, or the sword used by both Hal Jordan and Salakk. This is because making new constructs requires that the animators model them, while re-using existing ones is about as easy as using an existing prop in a live-action production.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> gained his trademark ability of flight in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheatricalCartoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheatricalCartoons">Superman Theatrical Cartoons</a></em> because they didn't want to have to animate him running and jumping to get around, and even when they did, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BouncingBattler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BouncingBattler">it looked kinda silly seeing him bounce all over the place.</a> This carries over to all other media, including the comics. This is why his famed listing of powers mentions leaping tall buildings in a single bound, but not the presumably more impressive flight. Later on, it was changed to "Able to soar higher than any plane!", but this didn't catch on as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em> has some of this going on in its depictions of transformation. In most shows barring G1, characters visibly change their designs upon scanning a vehicle mode, but in <em>Prime</em>, they tend to have the same design before-and-after, which results in things like Airachnid having helicopter chunks on her shoulders <em>before</em> she gets a helicopter mode. They also never display their Cybertronian altmodes until they can scan an Earth vehicle. Obviously, creating a tweaked model with its signature design elements removed would be a bit problematic when it'd likely be around for only one scene—detailed CGI models ain't cheap or easy to make. (This was also a reason behind the show's smaller cast compared to various 2D productions, something that also plagued fellow series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em>.) There's also Makeshift, who is an outright shapeshifter with the ability to take nearly any form. Outside of one brief still shot where he's little more than a silhouette, he spends all his appearances in his sole episode impersonating Wheeljack, meaning they could just use Wheeljack's model for him before killing him off.
