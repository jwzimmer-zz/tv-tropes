Luckily for the police, someone has come forward confessing to the crime. Unluckily for the police, the person making the confession didn't commit the crime. Sometimes the police will see through the confession and instantly know that the person is lying. Other times, unfortunately, they will buy into the guy's story, derailing their investigation (at least temporarily). In some cases, even after the person's confession is shown to be false, some of the detectives will still go with it.
</p><p>The possible reasons for the false confession are many. Perhaps the character is confessing because he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaDidntRaiseNoCriminal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaDidntRaiseNoCriminal">knows or thinks one of his loved ones is really the criminal</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheHeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheHeat">and is covering</a>. Perhaps the character is mentally ill and is willing to confess to just about anything the police tell him to confess to. Perhaps the character just wants the publicity. Perhaps the real killer is coercing the character into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheHeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheHeat">Taking the Heat</a>. And maybe, just maybe, the character actually thinks he committed the crime. Also, as real life interrogation tapes show, being questioned by the police can be a highly stressful experience. If made to go through it long enough, a suspect may confess just to end it, whether they're guilty or not. This can also be done sometime through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality">Police Brutality</a>.

This could possibly lead to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a> of this trope when it is later revealed that the "serial confessor" actually did the crime this time.

<ul><li> In <em>Bedlam</em>, Fillmore Press is a former psychotic killer who turned to <em>solving</em> grisly murders using his unique understanding of the criminally insane mind. To this end, he confesses to a string of serial killings because a) he feels the police won't listen to him unless they absolutely have to, and b) he thinks the real killer is just getting warmed up and has to be stopped as soon as possible. He helps along the investigation quite a bit, but the detectives working the case think he really is the killer and refuse to let him go when he recants his confession.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FromHell">From Hell</a></em>, apart from the dozens of letters from "Jack" (with different handwritings), the appendix accounts a few false confessions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Predator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Predator">Predator</a>: Race War</em>: Upon his arrest, serial killer Mark Towers tries to take credit for a string of ritual homicides actually committed by a Predator. Amusingly, the false confession has a nested "false confession about a false confession" within it, as he claims some of his other murders were wrongly confessed to by Ted Bundy. A profiler sees right through Towers when shown the tape of this interview; "trophy-taking" isn't in his MO, he's just trying to create a media circus around him for attention. Towers gets what he wants, six life sentences and a rep anybody will respect, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Predator kills him in his cell, takes his skull as a trophy, and decides the supermax prison full of violent offenders is an ideal hunting ground</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinCity">Sin City</a></em> has two rather tragic examples. Both John Hartigan and Marv are framed for crimes they didn't commit but in both cases, they confess to the charges to protect loved ones.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em>, Night Owl and Silk Specter discuss a "supervillain" who would compulsively confess to all sorts of crimes because he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MischiefForPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MischiefForPunishment">wanted to be beaten up by a superhero</a>.

They're mocking the President on how he has no evidence and they're about to pull the plot off when Mac bursts into the Oval Office. He tells them to call the whole thing off or he'll go to the press and...confess. "To my complicity in <em>our</em> plot to take over the government." As he points out, how else could he know of all this unless he was in on it? The conspirators realize to their shock that by confessing to involvement, Mac will reveal the entire plot and while he may go to jail, they certainly will for treason.
<div class="indent"><strong>Secretary Potter</strong>: No one will believe you! You're just a lowly Colonel!
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Mac</strong>: So was Oliver North. The American people are funny. They may not believe an accusation from the President but they <em>will</em> believe a confession from just about anyone.

So they released a false detail of the crimes, and <em>everyone</em> who confessed gave that false detail.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HappyDeathDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HappyDeathDay">Happy Death Day</a></em>: Tree falsely claims she was driving drunk after a cop stops her for speeding, hoping he will take her to jail where she'll be safe. Unfortunately, it doesn't work.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HorrorsOfTheBlackMuseum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HorrorsOfTheBlackMuseum">Horrors of the Black Museum</a></em>, the police arrest a man named Tom Rivers who confesses to all four murders, with enough detail to make him convincing. However, he later starts confessing to additional murders, and talks about a death ray he is inventing, and the police realize that he is a serial fantasist. He is ultimately confined to a mental institution.

After the boys are arrested, they assume it's because they accidentally shoplifted a can of tuna. In fact, they're suspected of murdering the store clerk (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it was a completely different pair of guys that happened to do it mere minutes after they leave and who happened to have a similar car color</span>). One of them starts explaining the shoplifting, causing the sheriff to ask if that's why they shot the clerk. Cue the kid's confused half-question-half-statement "I shot the clerk?" which he repeats several times, trying to wrap his head around the idea. The sheriff takes it as a confession and later testifies to that effect in court. Notably, the kid doesn't sign a written confession, but his utterance is treated as one. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The sheriff later admits he misinterpreted it after the real killers turn up in another state, though.</span>
</li><li> A mentally unstable grocery boy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNakedCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNakedCity">The Naked City</a></em> confesses to have killed Jean Dexter, but detective Muldoon convicts him of lying by asking details of the murder which the boy answers wrong.

</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Turk182" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Turk182">Turk 182</a></em>, a whole crowd of people show up to confess that they are the titular graffiti artist, including Jimmy Lynch (who really is Turk 182). It is, in fact, Jimmy's disgust and derision at the false confessors that convinces a TV reporter that he is, in fact, actually Turk.

<ul><li> In <em>Trials and Tribulations</em>, Ron DeLite, a meek and timid guy, confessed being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanThief">Gentleman Thief</a> Mask☆DeMasque the day after his last heist, even though he didn't have the object stolen, and when Phoenix goes to visit his wife she tells him that Ron is deluded and thinks he is DeMasque. Turns out DeLite <em>is</em> Mask☆DeMasque, but didn't commit the crime in question. He confessed to have an alibi because at the time of the theft there was a murder in which he was implicated, but which he didn't commit either, and the one who did commit the murder had the same idea and had Phoenix find him as Mask☆DeMasque in court.
</li><li> Also in <em>Ace Attorney</em>, there's Lana Skye who confessed to stabbing a detective to death. She was arrested and put on a rather lengthy (by AA standards anyway) and complicated trial before it was eventually revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she was covering up for the chief of police, the real murderer, who for the last two years since the SL-9 Incident, had been using Lana as his puppet.</span> In reality, Lana <strong>did</strong> stab the victim, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">however, she did so after said victim was already dead in order to fabricate a false murder weapon to throw suspicion away from the chief. She was caught in this act by a witness, making it seem like she was stabbing the victim to death.</span> Although this is more a case of Lana having to cover for the real killer rather then wanting to. As Phoenix says: "Protecting? No. I think 'afraid of' is more like it."

To his credit, it takes nearly a <strong>year</strong> of this treatment to get him to give his False Confession, and even then he only confesses to (and is convicted of) being an accomplice and not the actual murderer.

One of which is from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Juniper Woods</span>, the defendant, and the other two are from the two witnesses in the trial (as well as friends of the defendant), <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hugh O'Connor and Robin Newman</span>. It turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">All three confessions are in fact false, and occurred one after the other in a domino effect. Robin "confessed" to save Juniper from getting convicted, causing Juniper to "confess" so her friends can't take the rap for her any-more, which in turn causes Hugh to "confess" to nullify Juniper's confession. Hugh's confession is also partly out of self-protection too: Since Robin and Juniper's confessions were rather obviously out of protection for one another rather then due to their actual guilt, Hugh, the only other suspect at the time, would have seemed pretty guilty if he stayed quiet. In other words he actually <em>confessed to make himself NOT look like the culprit</em></span>.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hugh O'Connor does this <em>again</em> the next day when it starts seeming like Juniper would be found guilty</span>, even using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Insane Troll Logic</a> to "prove" how he could have committed the crime.

However, since she was raised from birth to be Fuyuhiko's bodyguard and servant, and to view herself as nothing more than a tool without free will, in her mind she <em>isn't</em> the murderer but the murder <em>weapon</em>, and Fuyuhiko is the real murderer since she acted on his behalf. Thus, voting for her is the wrong choice and Fuyuhiko wins the killing game and gets to go free. Neither Monokuma <em>or</em> Fuyuhiko accept this argument</span>.

<p></p><ul><li> A man named Robert Hubert confessed to starting the Great Fire of London in 1666 by throwing a fire bomb through a bakery window. It was shown during his trial that he was out of the country until two days after the start of the fire, that he was never near the bakery in question in any case, the bakery had no windows, and that Hubert himself was a cripple who was physically incapable of throwing a bomb. Despite all this, Hubert was found guilty and hanged for the crime.
</li><li> Over a hundred people confessed to the Lindbergh Baby kidnapping in 1932.
<ul><li> And over five hundred confessed to committing the Black Dahlia murder in 1947.
</li><li> Especially in high profile cases like these, it's now fairly common practice for police not to release a key detail about the crime scene or victim, so they can easily tell that a confession is false if the confessor doesn't know that detail.
</li></ul></li><li> John Mark Karr confessed to killing JonBenet Ramsey. Not only did he not do it, he had a record for being a serial confessor.
</li><li> It's not just the whackjobs confessing: it's well documented that police can get false confessions out of people they honestly believe to be suspects by wearing them down in interrogations and/or scaring them. Despite all the times this happens, some juries, police and prosecutors <em>still</em> claim that innocent people wouldn't do this and express disbelief at the idea.
<ul><li> It has been shown that even if the jury knows a confession is false they are more likely to convict a person who gave a false confession, than one who did not, with the same evidence.
</li><li> It's also been demonstrated that some interrogation tactics (such as repeatedly having the suspect go over how they would have committed the crime <em>if</em> they did it) can if applied with sufficient energy leave an originally rational suspect believing they <em>really did</em> commit the crime. Which doesn't help said suspect during a trial at all, of course.
</li><li> Another tactic is "tainting the suspect". The suspect is "accidentally" brought into a room where a bunch of evidence is on display and left there for a few minutes before taken into the interrogation room. When the suspect is then finally brow-beaten into confessing he can mention the key detail mentioned above as "proof" he is the real thing. It's also common to feed the suspect crucial information during the interrogation that they can repeat back as if it were their own. Thankfully interrogations are often recorded now and this can be shown.

It was later found that the host had shot himself by accident, and the man "confessing" had done so because he found that his time being spent in jail while awaiting his trial counted as part of his sentence. If he was found guilty, he would get to go home anyway in three days. If he pleaded not guilty, but was found guilty, then his sentence could have been massively increased.
</li><li> Sadly common in totalitarian regimes. An old Soviet joke runs like this: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CIA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CIA">CIA</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MoscowCentre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MoscowCentre">KGB</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GaulsWithGrenades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GaulsWithGrenades">GIGN</a> have an argument about who is best at catching fugitives. Tired of their bickering, the Secretary-General of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UnitedNations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UnitedNations">United Nations</a> sets them a task-each is given a ten square miles of forest, in which there is a white rabbit, which they must catch. Their respective efforts go like this:
<div class="indent"><strong>CIA:</strong> The CIA bugged the entire forest, used satellite imagery, set up a network of informants among the woodland creatures, and interviewed all plant and mineral witnesses. After six months with no leads, they concluded that the rabbit does not exist. <br/><strong>GIGN:</strong> The GIGN, after a month with no leads, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">burned down the forest, killing everything in it.</a> They argue that the rabbit had it coming. <br/><strong>KGB:</strong> Four KGB agents walk into the forest. Ten minutes later, they emerged with a badly tortured squirrel, which is yelling "Okay, I'm a rabbit, I'm a rabbit!"
</div></li><li> A visit to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.innocenceproject.org/understand/False-Confessions.php">The Innocence Project<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is well worth your time. They have an entire category, linked above, for cases where false confessions were given.
</li><li> Many false claims of responsibility by a wide range of groups pop up whenever a terrorist incident takes place, moreso if the incident itself doesn't have an immediate clear-cut perpetrator (i.e., a package left behind with a bomb in it). Here, it's generally because the nominal repugnance of whatever just happened (at least to those making such claims) is less important than getting one's particular group's name out into the public consciousness.
</li><li> A Swedish man named <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sture_Bergwall">Sture Bergwall<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (or more famously in the media, Thomas Quick) once confessed to having committed over thirty murders while incarcerated at Säter mental hospital. He would later on get convicted for eight of the murders solely on the basis of his own confessions while undergoing recovered-memory therapy. Many years later, he confessed having made it all up, partly because he did not want to leave the hospital, partly because he wanted to please his doctors and get their friendship by being an interesting patient and partly because he was "rewarded" with strong medications when he confessed. Journalists later found out that the prosecution, the police, Bergwall's doctors and even the original defense attorney had systematically withheld information from the courts showing that he lacked any detailed knowledge about the murders he confessed. The Swedish legal system ended up granting him re-trials and ultimately acquitting him on all charges, even if the prosecutor and some of the people originally involved in his case still insist on his guilt.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Ludke">Bruno Ludke<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> confessed to killing over fifty women in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> Germany, but may not have committed any of the murders.
</li><li> Henry Lee Lucas confessed to murdering over <em>3,000</em> people in the southern United States with his partner in crime Otis Toole. While it is agreed he did murder one couple, Lucas began confessing to many other murders as well (likely for better treatment, as he had been roughed up by other inmates in jail). Police began giving him more cold case files of murders, which he duly confessed to, but without showing any verifiable knowledge. In some, it was shown he was many miles away at the time, or had rock-solid alibis. Aside from this, his murder spree would have required going across thousands of miles in one month. Though convicted of <em>157</em> murders on the basis of his confessions, all but 11 would later be overturned. His death sentence for the murder of one unidentified woman was commuted (notably by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">George W. Bush</a>, one of the only times he did this) and Lucas died in prison. Some investigators believe that he <em>might</em> have killed around 40 people along with Toole. As the latter had offered statements to corroborate Lucas's, doubt has been raised over Toole's guilt in many murders also. One murder he confessed to was that of 6-year old Adam Walsh, which inspired his father to create <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasMostWanted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasMostWanted">America's Most Wanted</a></em>, but later recanted. The case was closed in 2008 with the authorities officially stating they believed Toole did it. Nonetheless, this shows the danger of false confessions, as hundreds of cases have been closed even though Lucas and Toole are likely not the real perpetrators, who are no longer even being sought.
</li><li> An original, literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchHunt">Witch Hunt</a> is associated with these. There's almost no way to prove you're <em>not</em> a witch once accused, and many suspects confessed because they were tortured or suffering in jail and wanted to get it over with. This had varying outcomes; in some places a confessed witch would still be sentenced to death, but <em>not</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch">burned alive</a>, but in others they would only be jailed in hopes of using their testimony against other witch suspects. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SalemIsWitchCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SalemIsWitchCountry">Salem</a> is known for the latter approach; confessions usually named names or at least said there were more, unidentified witches, heightening the town's paranoia. Confessing at Salem would also spare your life, unlike in most such cases.
