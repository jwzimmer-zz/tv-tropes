</div></div><p>One of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou">classic and most common character types in gaming</a> is the generalist, a jack-of-all-trades with capabilities in all fields and no particular weaknesses. But specialization has advantages, so it takes a deft touch to ensure that the generalist has reasons for being used.
</p><p>Sometimes it simply doesn't work. They aren't completely useless at anything they try, but they're not good at it either. They have no particular weakness or vulnerability that can be easily exploited, but that's offset by the fact that they're kinda vulnerable to <em>everything</em>. That character is a Master of None.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Master of None is the dark side of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a>, where their weakness is the fact that they have no strengths that they can capitalize on. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a> is easy to make into this, if the developers want to encourage specialisation in magic or physical combat. If the Master of None is part of a band or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiformBalance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiformBalance">Multiform Balance</a>, it often has some useful ability (for example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperNotDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperNotDrowningSkills">Super Not-Drowning Skills</a>) that prevent them from becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman">it's just that the ability isn't very versatile</a>.
</p><p>However, there may be some incentive to use the Master of None in circumstances over the Jack-of-All-Stats beyond the merits of the characters themselves. In an RPG setting, they're the easiest to mold and grow, and can grow themselves with less effort than the other classes or origins because they might have started in Level 1; therefore, they're more useful for experienced players who know how to spend their skill points more wisely. In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame">Metagame</a> setting, the Master of None has a niche in their surprise factor and lack of predictability: not only will opponents be caught off guard at seeing an unfamiliar character, but they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem">may not even be aware of</a> - let alone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">predict</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMetagameCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMetagameCharacter">prepare for</a> - what they can pull from their arsenal of equally viable options. While an AI opponent would be indifferent towards which playable characters are used beyond what strategies to use against them, the psychological effect a Master of None can have on human opponents may be enough to turn the tides of a match.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The difference between why a Jack-of-All-Stats is useful in one game, but becomes a Master of None in another is often tied to how large the party or units are in the game. In a game with only one character, the character needs the capacity to handle every situation themselves, and in static parties with no ability to switch characters out, the ability to just be very good in one situation means being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">The Load</a> in other situations. In a strategic RPG with dozens of characters you can swap out any time you need a specialist, however, there's no reason to swap in anything but the specialist best at this particular specialization. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryHeadcountLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryHeadcountLimit">If you can only send 4 characters in</a>, any character 5th place or worse in your roster in that situation is a sub-optimal choice. Even if there's a character that can do nothing but use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">poison spells</a> that deal more damage than normal, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">that's a specialization that makes them stand out from the faceless crowds sometimes</a>. If they're not in the top spots in <em>any</em> situation... why ever use them at all? Some games - especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">much harder ones</a> - answer this by <em>requiring</em> the player to deploy the Master of None, so that they'll be using them anyway if they don't want them to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">The Load</a>.

Contrast with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll">Master of All</a>, who is <em>very good</em> at everything.

<ul><li> Faize of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTheLastHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTheLastHope">Star Ocean: The Last Hope</a></em>. He starts off well enough, being your first offensive symbologist and having some melee skills, but he's soon overshadowed by Lymle and Myuria in attack symbology while Edge and Meracle outclass him physically. The Bradygames strategy guide actually recommends leaving him out of the party for your first playthrough due to how hard it is for him to pull his weight since he later leaves about 5/8ths of the way through the game. Even if you keep him for a second playthrough when he has the opportunity to learn much more useful and unique symbols, he's still shortchanged in the weapons department, with his best being a coliseum prize until you get to the second bonus dungeon.
</li><li> Kratos/Zelos in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em> remain somewhat competent melee combatants throughout the game thanks to having the stats for it and ability to pull off a full combo, but they quickly lose in spell casting because they stop at level 2 spells (opposed to the exponentially more powerful level 3 spells Genis has) and casting does not synergize well with melee due to the rather lengthy start up times. They have decent supplemental healing though, thanks to it being based on percentage instead of fixed numbers.
</li><li> Two of the classes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EtrianOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EtrianOdyssey">Etrian Odyssey</a> II</em> suffer from this. War Magi can use healing and support magic as well as sword-based attack skills, but their healing doesn't stack up next to that of a dedicated Medic, their buffs are less useful than a Troubadour's, and their attack skills are woefully situational (stunning an enemy afflicted with Sleep?). Add to that their overall unimpressive stats and there's no real reason to use a War Magus over one of the specialists. Likewise, Beasts have a variety of defensive abilities and strong offense, but due to a number of flaws with their skills as well as a lack of decent armor they usually end up being more of a liability than anything else. Thankfully, the game's remake makes major improvements to both classes' abilities to make them viable choices for your party.
<ul><li> Medics in <em>Etrian Odyssey IV</em> fall under this once subclassing becomes available. A lot of their healing skills become sufficiently powerful at half their max level, meaning that anything a Medic main can do, a Runemaster or Arcanist with a Medic subclass can similarly accomplish. Their offense skills (Heavy Strike or Stardrop) are at their best when going first, but the Medic's own Strength and Agility stats are average and do not synergize well without assistance. To rub salt in the wound, Dancers have better stats than the Medic and can both heal and buff.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningForce">Shining Force</a></em>: Arthur starts out as a Master of None, at least until his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">Magikarp Power</a> kicks in. He's a fighter with some spells, but for the first several levels after getting him, he dies in two hits, barely does more than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a>, and has only level 1 spells.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedMage">Red Mages</a> in most games after the first tend to lose effectiveness very quickly. While they can use swords as well as cast both black and white magic, the spells they learn are never as powerful as dedicated black or white mages, their armor level is just okay, and their damage output is outdone by multiple other classes. Not to mention, since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII">Final Fantasy III</a></em>, games that use a job system also typically give you the ability to switch to different ones, meaning the Red Mage's advantage of being potentially useful in any situation doesn't really matter when you can simply switch to something actively specialized for that situation. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em> even taunts you by not only making the Red Mage's skills more expensive to learn than their counterparts, but by making their final ability (which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">the only reason to be training a Red Mage</a>) be the most expensive in the game at 999 Battle Points.
</li><li> In the NES version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI">Final Fantasy I</a></em>, the Thief has durability and damage output a slight step above the White and Black Mages, but without the casting prowess that makes those jobs viable. They also lack stealing, the main Thief utility in later games, which gives them even less to offer. In theory, they can escape from battles more effectively, but running is infamously buggy in the NES version, so while this can be used, it isn't reliable. On paper, their class change to Ninja should boost them up by giving them better weapon and armor selection and black magic, but the low-level offensive black magic the Ninja can learn is basically useless at that point, while the buffs are <em>also</em> bugged and don't work. By contrast, the Knight gains white magic, including healing spells and a buff spell that actually works in RUSE, the Master's damage output has ascended to absurdity, the Red Wizard already fills the role of a tanky black magic user that can <em>also</em> use white magic, and the Black Wizard can throw around more magic than the Ninja can ever dream of. The remakes did help the Ninja out a lot by fixing its skills to actually function, though it's still considered a somewhat subpar pick.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>:
<ul><li> Gogo can use almost any ability worth using in the game, and the player can customize which abilities he uses. However, all of Gogo's base stats are low, and unlike most of the other characters, he can't raise them because he can't equip Espers. So Gogo can do anything, but no matter what you have him do, he'll be bad at it.
</li><li> Setzer. He's not as strong as Sabin and Edgar, not as magically proficient as Relm and Strago, and worse all around than fellow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a> characters Terra and Celes. He shares his ability to attack with full damage from the back row with a lot of Locke's best weapons, but without Locke's speed. Setzer's Slot ability has a wide range of useful (and non-useful) effects, but being luck-based and with poor odds reduces its utility. The accessory that turns Setzer's Slot into GP Rain has the potential to do unblockable damage, but it costs money every time it's used, and you'd need to spend tens of thousands of gil to reach even halfway-decent damage, all in one of the few games in the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series where money isn't useless past the halfway mark. In all cases, anything Setzer can do is something that someone else could do better, and without his drawbacks.
</li></ul></li><li> Kimahri Ronso of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em> suffers from this. His section of the sphere grid is rather small, forcing him to go through someone else's to remain useful. This was meant to allow the player to use him as a flexible character. The problem is that Kimahri doesn't do anything better than anyone else. His stats are just okay in everything (even when sent to someone else's section of the Sphere Grid), and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack">piercing spears</a> pale in comparison to Auron's katanas. The Lancet ability drains HP and MP from enemies, but it's so weak that it'll probably be used only to learn enemy abilities and nothing else. Not even Kimahri's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Overdrives</a> are all that special; while he can use enemy attacks, the ones that do damage all only hit once, leaving him far behind everyone else's Overdrives as early as mid-game. Even Rikku's Overdrives are far more useful than anything Kimahri can do, since Rikku's Mix Overdrive has all sorts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> effects when applied correctly. In short, Kimahri's flexibility is unnecessary, and leaves him without a proper place in the party.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Smeargle from can learn any move in the game, but their poor stats mean that there's no point in teaching them 96 percent of them unless you're using them for breeding purposes. Granted, there are a few combinations of moves they can get that no other Pokémon can, but outside of those combinations, you're better off just using a more specialized Pokémon.
</li><li> There are several Pokémon that aren't useful as their stats are often too rounded, but Glalie is a good one. Apart from awful typing, all of its stats are an average 80. Other Pokémon with equal, below-average numbers in all stats are Ditto (48 each), Spinda (60), Castform (70), and Phione (80).
</li><li> Mixed-attackers tend to be this. Consisting of Pokémon trained in both physical and special moves, they're valued for their ability to hit both defenses, countering purpose-built walls like Blissey and Skarmory. However, their attacking stats are often far lower than a specialist Pokémon's single stat, their movepools have less space and tend to have less coverage, and given the need to EV train two stats, they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">often slower and more fragile</a>. Most "mixed attackers" are actually physical or special attackers who keep an unexpected move as a last resort.
</li><li> This trope is a recurring problem for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson">Ice-type</a>. Ice as a type is designed for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> play; it hits a large number of viable types super-effectively, but defensively is in a tie for the second-most weaknesses of any type, being weak to four types (Fire, Rock, Fighting, and Steel), and only resists itself (including being weak to the omnipresent Stealth Rock). This would be fine, except the overwhelming majority of Ice-types are seemingly designed to fit the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> mold, being based on big slow tough things like yetis, walruses, mammoths, polar bears, and actual glaciers, and consequently having high defenses and poor speed. This results in a large number of Pokémon that can't fulfill any role very well  they can't tank hits because they take double damage from nearly everything, they can't go on the offensive because they're so slow that the opponent takes them down before they can get a single hit in, and their movepools are too shallow to even try anything else. It's telling that the only Ice-types to historically have any success either are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedsters</a> like Weavile, have some kind of way to get around their awful speed like Cloyster or Mamoswine, or are slumming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Olympus Mons</a> like Kyurem.
</li><li> Silvally was designed to be a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">balanced</a>" counterpart to the legendary Arceus, a Pokémon widely regarded as <em>the</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll">Master of All</a>. The difference is, Arceus has 120 in every stat, a gigantic movepool, and the ability to become any type with an item that also boosts the power of its moves and a powerful move that it always gets STAB on. Silvally has 95 in every stat, a lackluster movepool, and the ability to become any type with an item that does nothing else and a middling move that it always gets STAB on.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0wwr1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0wwr1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0wwr1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Generation 8 at least buffed this move to make it as powerful as Arceus's version. (Its base power is actually higher than that of Arceus's move, but their power becomes equal once you take into account that Arceus's gets a 20% power boost from its Plate.)</span> While a 95 is at least better than most Pokémon that are in the "too well-rounded" category, it isn't good enough to give Silvally much of a niche; no matter what type it is or what moves it has, it's incompetent at all of them. The few Silvally types that did manage to find a niche in the lower tiers did so almost solely due to their type. Even Type: Null, its pre-evolved form, is considered better than most Silvally types, since it can at least use Eviolite to become a passable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a>.
</li><li> Electivire turned out to be this. On paper, it combines serviceable speed, a lot of moves providing it wide coverage, a typing granting it only one weakness, and a good ability. The problem is that it just isn't quite good enough at any of these things; 95 Speed is above average but not enough to outrun anything without a boost, its coverage is surprisingly ineffective when its Special Attack is mediocre, and while it only has one weakness, that weakness is to the very common Ground, while its defenses are average and its resistances are few. The result is something too slow to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a>, too frail to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a>, and not strong enough to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>, able to hit just about anything super-effectively but almost never actually take it out.
</li><li> Hitmonchan fell into a similar trap in the era where it was in RU. It was fairly bulky with an Assault Vest, but Hariyama and Gurrdurr were bulkier. It learned all the elemental punches for coverage, but even when hitting super-effectively, Hitmonlee was a better attacker. It had utility tricks like Drain Punch or Mach Punch, but Hitmontop and Pangoro could use them better. It learned Rapid Spin, but it lacked the tools to counter the Ghost-types that a spinner attracts. Nonetheless, it saw a lot of use as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkillGateCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkillGateCharacter">Skill Gate Character</a>, due to new players not understanding its weaknesses.
</li><li> This is a major reason why very few players use Zen Mode Darmanitan: it has the ability to shift to a different form when its HP is reduced, but the two forms have near-opposite focuses (a physically-focused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> and a specially-focused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a>). Consequently, you can't just focus everything on Speed and Attack when those stats will become useless after Darmanitan transforms, and you only have four moves to work with to fit both physical and special moves while maintaining any kind of coverage. And on top of that, Zen Mode can't really fill the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> role, by nature of the fact that it will always have only half its HP left. By contrast, non-Zen Mode Darmanitan just has Sheer Force, which focuses more on improving its initial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> nature, making it very preferable.
</li><li> Prior to obtaining a Mega Evolution, Pidgeot was this. Its stats were well-rounded, but not high enough to be particularly good at anything, its typing was pretty generic, and it didn't have any real gimmicks to save it. Worse, its typing meant that it was under constant competition from more specialized Normal/Flying-types. Even in the first generation, it was surpassed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> Dodrio, and the second added <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a> Noctowl, the third gave <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> Swellow, the fourth revealed an even better <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> in Staraptor, and so on. Mega Pidgeot, though, finally broke out of this by moving its stat boosts to Speed and Special Attack, and providing it a niche in a 100% accurate Hurricane.
</li><li> Before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonUltraSunAndUltraMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonUltraSunAndUltraMoon">Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon</a></em>, Kommo-o was considered the worst of all the Pseudo Legendaries due to being inferior at everything compared to the others. It had decent mixed attacking stats but Salamence and Hydreigon had higher. Its speed was alright but half the others had better. Even it's highest stat, defense, wasn't as high as Metagross. Luckily, Kommo-o later got a unique Z-Move that raised all of its stats, giving it a niche over the other Pseudo Legendaries.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a></em> offers some demons, characters, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona">Personas</a> that have perfectly balanced builds. These are much poorer choices of party members than characters who specialize in Strength or Magic, as such balanced characters can't dish out enough damage per turn or carry enough MP to be a worthy asset.
</li><li> Ken in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> is considered one of the worst party members thanks to not excelling at anything. His Lightning magic and physical skills are single-target only, and doesn't deal too much damage. He is tied with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Yukari</a> as the best healer, but Yukari also brings powerful Wind magic, which, excluding the protagonist, only she can use. Meanwhile, the other Lightning using party member, Akihiko, is stronger than Ken in both magic and physical damage. While Ken does have unique skills in Light based <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> skills, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">good luck hitting enemies with them</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest">Dragon Quest</a></em> franchise:
<ul><li> Yangus in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVIII">Dragon Quest VIII</a></em> looks like he should be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a>, with a build that suggests <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoutStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoutStrength">Stout Strength</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAxeToGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAxeToGrind">An Axe to Grind</a>. He's certainly slow enough, but his damage output is average at best, and pales next to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Jessica's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">spells</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhipItGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhipItGood">whips</a>, Angelo's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcherArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcherArchetype">bows and arrows</a>, and the Hero's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesPreferSwords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesPreferSwords">swords</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeOnAStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeOnAStick">spears</a>. He can get a few healing spells if you put points into Humanity, but his healing potential is limited by a small MP pool, and unlike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">the Hero</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">Angelo</a> he never gets any way to regain magic points or mitigate casting costs. He can wear some of the best armor in the game and has a massive HP pool, which qualifies him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a>, but since there's no way for him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrawAggro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrawAggro">Draw Aggro</a> he can't really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou">tank</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">squishier</a> party members. His Axe skills will eventually give him an attack which is a guaranteed critical if it hits, and since criticals in this game ignore defense, it's particularly useful against late-game bosses, but it misses more often than it hits, so it's too unreliable to use in most cases. Early in the game he's useful in boss fights as a debuffer, although Jessica can do that as well or better. In the late game, he's mostly useful to hold on to a Sage's Stone, Rune Staff, Timbrel of Tension and Resurrection Staff and act as a secondary buffer and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">healer</a>, not so much because he's particularly good at it, but because he's the only party member with nothing better to do.
</li><li> And long before that, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestII">Dragon Quest II</a></em> gave us the Prince of Cannock, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a> eclipsed in magic by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">the Princess of Moonbrooke</a> with a scant few unique cleric spells, and even more so physically and equip-wise by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">the Prince of Lorasia</a>.
</li><li> The concept is referenced in typical punny fashion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX">Dragon Quest IX</a></em>: one of the breezes in the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurricaneOfPuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurricaneOfPuns">Hurricane of Puns</a> is Abbot Jack of Alltrades Abbey, who consumes a Fygg and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">becomes the "Master of Nu'un"</a>.
</li><li> Rab in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestXI">Dragon Quest XI</a></em> is this. He can deal physical damage with claws, but his strength is weak. He can heal, but his heal stat is weak compared to the healer. He has some buffs, but not nearly as many buffs as the healer. He has a lot of debuffs, but debuff success rate is dependent on the magic damage stat, which is not nearly as high as the black mage in the party, who also has a lot of debuffs. He has a lot damage spells, but once again his magic damage stat is not as high as the black mage. If you feed him a lot of stat seeds he has the potential to be the most versatile character in the game, but in general anything he can do another character can do better.
</li></ul></li><li> The player's ultimate goal in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RakenzarnTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RakenzarnTales">Rakenzarn Tales</a></em> is to turn Kyuu, the main character, into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll">Master of All</a>. His unique class, the Arxus Rogue, is capable of learning plenty of types of physical and magical moves and wield a huge variety of weapons. However, due to the fact that he's not a real fighter and suffers from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyLevels">Empty Levels</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardSkillLearning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardSkillLearning">Non Standard Skill Learning</a>, a poorly handled training will turn him into this trope instead.
</li><li> Hugh of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarII">Phantasy Star II</a></em> is unfortunately a master in an area which nearly every other party member is at least competent in, as his biologic-affecting techniques aren't that much more useful than regular techniques or even regular attacks, and the regular techniques he learns never reach their final level of power.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">Self-Imposed Challenge</a>, the Deprived class, starts with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedOnArrival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedOnArrival">no armor</a> and an extremely shoddy weapon and shield and has 11 in all of its stats, meaning that while it's not bad at anything to start out with, it's not particularly <em>good</em> at anything either, and the player will have to grind their stats up a bit before they can really be effective.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder">Fate/Grand Order</a></em>:
<ul><li> Artoria Pendragon was designed to be an all-rounder with a mix of skills to let her fit on any team, but poor synergy between her skills and lack of power in those skills left her mediocre all-around for much of the game's lifespan. She has a decently damaging multi-target Noble Phantasm in Excalibur and a skill to boost it up... but her Attack is kind of low for her rarity, and she didn't have a way to charge it up aside from her Arts cards. She had Intuition to give herself critical stars... but her deck has only one Quick card, so she doesn't build stars much, and the skill is far too little to compete with a dedicated Quick user. And she has Charisma to boost up her allies... but not to a significant amount, especially not compared to dedicated buffers. On top of that, she's a five-star, the rarest type; compared to four-star Sabers like Artoria Alter (has a more damaging Noble Phantasm and comparable attack) or Lancelot (has two skills that not only boost his critical stars but also his critical damage), she ends up coming up short, much less other five-stars. She ended up eventually getting Intuition upgraded into the much better Radiant Road EX, which gave her a bit more of a focus as a farmer by allowing her to use Excalibur to drop a wave quickly.
</li><li> Siegfried at launch suffered from this. It seemed like the designers of his abilities and Noble Phantasm wanted him to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">an offensive monster</a>, while the designers of his stat spread wanted him to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">an impregnable tank.</a> The result was a Servant with extremely high HP that he couldn't boost or heal, and abilities that served to boost his pathetic offense to the point that he might be able to scratch people with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Balmung</a>. He also had a focus on killing dragons, but the vast majority of dragons are Rider-class, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors">meaning he doesn't get type advantage over them</a> and often ends up outdone in his focus by every Assassin in the game. Later updates had to provide him with two additional skills and a buff to his Noble Phantasm, which made him more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualGrinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualGrinder">Gradual Grinder</a> who can actually kill dragons.
</li><li> Geronimo has three skills: one to boost his Quick cards, one to boost his Buster cards, and one to boost his Arts cards, along with a balanced deck. In theory, this means he should be able to pull off any strategy. Unfortunately, two of these three are wasted on him (he has only one Quick card, so the first is useless, and he takes a flat damage penalty due to being a Caster, so the second isn't much better). As a result, he ends up relying on his Arts boost most of the time, which comes out as mediocre when many characters, especially other Casters, actually <em>specialize</em> in making use of Arts cards and have multiple skills to boost Arts or decks with three Arts cards to Geronimo's two.
</li><li> Poor Boudica. The Rider class is meant to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass">Critical Hit Class</a>, and Boudica has a Quick-and-Arts focused deck to generate stars. Unfortunately, she also has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a>-style stat layout and terrible offense even for her rarity, so mostly she just sucks up all those stars for herself and then does three crits that barely scratch the enemy. This defensive focus would have potential, especially combined with her Battle Continuation to survive hits that'd kill her... except that she's in competition with Georgios, who is <em>also</em> a tanky Rider with Battle Continuation, but he has a self-heal, a defense increase that also forces enemies to target him, the ability to do some damage through Ascalon, and he's a whole star rating lower. Like Siegfried, she has a focus on killing a specific enemy type (Romans), but while dragons are semi-common and Lancer dragons do appear occasionally, Roman enemies are pretty rare and basically <em>none</em> of them are Casters, so it just boosts her damage from "awful" to "still bad." Finally, her Noble Phantasm is a party-wide defense buff which also increases attack when upgraded, which is similar to Mash's Lord Camelot... except Mash is better than Boudica in just about every way, and despite being a star rating higher at full power, she has 0 cost, so Boudica is essentially a budget version of someone she's more expensive than. Eventually, with the release of Romulus-Qurinius (a character with the ability to inflict "Roman" as a status effect) Boudica's niche was made a lot more useful... provided that you have a limited-time character who is already powerful by himself.
</li><li> Emiya is another who thankfully got buffed out of this. His main problem came down to the fact that he had a Buster-type NP, when his main skill and deck were designed to make use of Arts cards. This made it impossible for him to match it with his deck and Brave Chain, or use his boosting skill Magecraft on it, meaning his damage output was bad. Furthering the problem was his Skill, Clairvoyance, which boosted up critical star generation: would be useful if he had a Quick deck with good hitcounts, but he doesn't, so it just raised his star generation from "awful" to "still not great." Thankfully, Clairvoyance got turned into Hawkeye (which more than doubled its star generation and added a crit boost on top) and Magecraft got turned into Projection Magecraft (which turned from just boosting Arts to boosting all card types), which turned him into a fairly effective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass">Critical Hit Class</a> whose abilities finally synergized with each other.

Problem was, it was closer to this trope. Ivysaur doesn't hit anywhere near as hard as Charizard, and it lacks Squirtle's comboing abilities. It being heavier than Squirtle is counterbalanced by the fact that it has an atrocious recovery and air game, making it comparatively easy to KO, and speed and maneuverability on the ground and in the air is abysmal compared to Charizard. Worst of all, the game attempted to implement a form of the original game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">Elemental RockPaperScissors</a>, but while plant-based moves to take down Squirtle and water-based moves to take down Charizard are only used by a handful of characters, fire-based moves are legion, making Ivysaur even easier to flatten.

<ul><li> Competitive <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em> circles assign this to the Pyro class — Pyros are among the least seen classes because their abilities, while considerable, are simply overshadowed by the other choices available to a 6-man team. Pyros move at average speed and excel at short range, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Scout</a> is both faster and more agile, and deals damage in bigger chunks. It's a good defensive class in close quarters, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Heavy</a> has better range, more health, and deals more damage. Spy checking, airblasting, Ubercharge denial, and sentry defense, its remaining important uses, simply don't account for much competitive playtime due to the lack of need or lack of acceptance of the role. Even its last remaining ability, damage over time (something only a select few other classes can inflict with specific weapons — the Pyro can do it with any of their primary weapons, a good deal of their secondaries, and even one or two melee weapons), isn't all that helpful anymore, as every other update over the first four or five years introduced another easy-to-use weapon or ability to extinguish someone that a Pyro has set on fire. Ironically, this puts the Pyro (considered one of the classes requiring the least thinking to play) together with the Spy (considered the class requiring the <em>most</em> thinking to play) in the bottom of the competitive class tier — neither class' abilities play into a match strongly enough to justify their regular inclusion in a 6 vs. 6 skirmish. They are strong in competitive 9v9 Highlander (where only one of each class is allowed per team), however. You will want to deprive the enemy Ubercharge or kill the enemy Pyro before pushing in with your own Ubercharge first, as a defensive Pyro can utterly shut down an Uber push, especially if he receives an Ubercharge himself.
</li><li> The Balance-class ships in space battles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsBattlefrontII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsBattlefrontII">Star Wars: Battlefront II</a></em> (i.e., X-Wing, TIE Fighter, ARC-170 and Droid Starfighter/Vulture Droid). Anyone who knows what they're doing will immediately get in a Bomber-class ship (Y-Wing, TIE Bomber, V-Wing and CIS Strike Bomber) and go for the high-scoring capital ship vital systems. This may also be combined with a quick stop within the enemy capital ship to wreak havoc inside, in which case the heavily-armored Bombers, especially with a co-pilot to assist, are ideal (even over Transports, who can insert an entire team into the enemy capital ship and let them respawn there until the transport is destroyed, but are even slower, more ungainly, <em>and</em> less durable than Bombers - without pulling off two or three other players to escort them instead of actively contributing to the battle, it's essentially two to five free kills for whoever manages to spot them along the way). If all of the vital systems are destroyed and the match still isn't over, the only real option is to get in a Fighter-class ship (A-Wing, TIE Interceptor, Republic Starfighter and Droid Tri-fighter) and kill enemies ship-to-ship. The Balance-class ships don't have the raw payload of Bombers to be even slightly effective against capital ships and are far less effective at ship-to-ship combat than Fighters. The only possible, <em>concrete</em> advantage Balance ships have against Fighters is that they can attack enemies within the range of the opposing capital ship's automated defenses if those haven't been disabled yet - mildly annoying for a Balance ship and beneath notice for a Bomber, but a lightly-armored Fighter that gets in range of them will get pasted in one shot.
</li><li> Combat Rifles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlacklightRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlacklightRetribution">Blacklight Retribution</a></em> were presumably meant to fill the gap between Assault Rifles and Bolt-Action Rifles: More powerful and longer-ranged than the former, less recoil and faster-firing than the latter. In practice the downsides are more obvious: Weaker and shorter-ranged than Bolt-Actions, more recoil and slower-firing than Assaults.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfJuarezGunslinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfJuarezGunslinger">Call of Juarez: Gunslinger</a></em>, the Sixshooter is intended to be the middle ground between the killing power of the Ranger and the rapid-fire Quickshooter, in practice using it means getting neither the Ranger's near-guaranteed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One Hit Kills</a> nor the Quickshooter's combo-extending speed-reloads.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfJuarezTheCartel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfJuarezTheCartel">The Cartel</a></em> manages to <em>invert</em> this with Eddie, who specializes in the one-handed machine pistols. Presumably meant as the short-range specialist (with his special ability being using two machine pistols <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">at the same time</a>), this ends up meaning he's ultimately the only one that noticeably cripples himself from performing in any other role with his specific weapons. Ben is closer to a mid-range specialist with his machine guns, but they do just fine at any range except close-in (where their long reloads can hinder them), and for those he has secondary specialization in the shotguns (which perform just as well as the machine pistols) and the handguns (which can be mixed-and-matched by <em>any</em> character, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperPistol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperPistol">as typical</a> are a bit stronger and more accurate than the machine pistols, on top of being the only weapon category with any attempt at variety). Kim, likewise, specializes in the long-range sniper rifles, but isn't hurting for other ranges either, since her secondary specialization is with the assault rifles and two-handed submachine guns, which handle <em>any</em> range just fine. Not to mention as well that Eddie's special ability is ultimately redundant, since if you really want something full-auto while using two guns at once, there's a very easy to activate glitch that lets Ben and Kim use a machine pistol alongside another pistol as well.
</li></ul></li><li> For the starting handguns in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOps">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a></em>, this befalls the humble M1911. All three of the starting handguns deal the same damage at the same ranges, so it's ultimately their secondary characteristics that determine which is the better sidearm - and in that area, the M1911 can <em>at best</em> only match one attribute of one of the other two, which is usually worse than the third anyway. It beats the ASP in attachment options, but so does the Makarov, which also beats them both in mag capacity. It beats the Makarov in capacity with Extended Mags, but that also extends its reloading time, which the ASP already beats both of them in. It gets a rate of fire increase with Dual Wield that the Makarov doesn't get, but that only makes it equal the rate of fire the ASP has at all times, alongside the inability to aim down the sights to make the faster rate of fire worth anything beyond point-blank range (at that point, if you want to go Akimbo you're better off doing it with a fully-automatic, higher-capacity SMG that makes up for the lower accuracy by spraying a lot more lead at a much quicker rate). The later CZ-75, though being worse in fire rate (matching the slower handguns normally and being even slower with Full Auto), beats them all in capacity, especially with extended mags, and the Python, while losing out in reload speed (which can be rectified) and capacity, makes up for it with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolversAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolversAreJustBetter">greater damage</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperPistol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperPistol">potential at range</a>. All of the other available secondary weapons are one-shot weapons meant for specific roles, either destroying enemy killstreaks or weird '60s gimmicks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">the devs thought were cool</a>, but when used on other players are all a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> anyway.
<ul><li> <em>Black Ops</em> also has the Uzi, considered to be the worst gun in <em>Call of Duty</em> history. The submachine guns fall into one of two categories: slow-firing types with high bullet damage and more versatility like the AK-74u and MPL, or rapid-firing types with low bullet damage and good handling like the Spectre and Mac-11. The Uzi, presumably in an attempt to differentiate it from its Mini variation in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare">Modern Warfare</a></em> series (where it fit into the latter group) doesn't fall into either category and suffers for it. While it has a high fire-rate, the sluggish aim time and reloads doesn't make it viable for run-and-gun tactics. Likewise, the low bullet damage and inconsistent recoil pattern make it unable to compete at range with the likes of the AK-74u, which is considered the most popular SMG. It doesn't help matters that its ironsights are terrible and it doesn't have a unique gimmick to stand out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsII">Black Ops II</a></em> fixes the pistol issue from the previous game by only starting you with two handguns and giving them specific, opposite roles to fill (the Five-Seven is high-capacity with a fast rate of fire, low recoil, and quick but consistent damage drop-off; the Tac-45 is low-capacity, fires more slowly with heavier recoil, but its max-damage range reaches much farther before a very sudden drop-off), so this instead befalls the later Executioner for the reason that it's trying to fit into multiple roles at once. As a revolver that fires <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunSAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunSAreJustBetter">shotgun shells</a>, it's meant to combine the quick switch-time and movement speed of a handgun with the raw power and spread of a shotgun. Unfortunately, it happens to be trying this in a series that A) already gives pistols ridiculously-high damage at close range (both the aforementioned pistols deal as much damage at their max-damage range as the FAL OSW, the second-strongest assault rifle in the game, which is enough to kill in two shots) and B) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeShotgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeShotgun">hates shotguns with a burning passion</a>, so the shotgun benefits ultimately come at the cost of basically every other worthwhile attribute. While it does deal one-shot kills at point-blank range, the damage falls off so quickly that you need almost the entire five-shot cylinder for a single kill past about four feet (a distance where even the primary shotguns never need more than two unless you outright miss a shot); much further than that and the pellets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryMaximumRange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryMaximumRange">disappear entirely</a>, removing the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperPistol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperPistol">weakly plink away at an enemy to annoy them</a> like the other pistols. If you are within the range to land that one shot kill, you are probably in range to knife the enemy instead. On top of that, its spread is actually too <em>tight</em> for its intended range, so glancing blows on a target who slips off the screen in a quarter of a second because you're literally touching them will deal next to no damage. All this also comes packaged with the standard revolver downside that, until you manage to grind out the Fast Mags attachment to get a speedloader, you're stuck reloading each individual shell painfully slowly.
</li></ul></li><li> Another weapon example: assault rifles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">Borderlands 2</a></em>. They're touted as being more powerful and longer-reaching than SMGs, which they indeed do for a tradeoff in fire rate, reload speed and elemental proc chance. Problem is, they get trumped in their middle-range field by any half-decent Vladof machine pistol (especially if it has the shoulder stock accessory), all of which reload faster as well. Those that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring">can</a></em> hit at long range have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryGunPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryGunPower">anemic damage</a>, at which point you're better off just using a sniper rifle. And if you're going the Jakobs route of semi-autos, they have the worst recoil of all - better just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperPistol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperPistol">snipe with your wheelgun</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock2">BioShock 2</a></em> has the poor Rivet Gun. While it acts as a decent backup weapon it's still outclassed by more specialized weapons such as the Spear Gun for headshots, Machine Gun for groups of splicers, and Grenade Launcher for beefier foes. It's even outclassed by plasmids as the super heated rivets need 3 shots in quick succession or a single headshot to ignite splicers while doing as much damage as a level 1 Incinerate! plasmid. Overall, it helps get Delta through early levels and allows the player to decide on their play style whatever it may be.
</li><li> The Survivalist perk in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillingFloor2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillingFloor2">Killing Floor 2</a></em> combines some attributes of every class. This comes in the form of a universal damage bonus that applies to every weapon in the game, but which isn't as much of a bonus as the perk it's dedicated to would get at the same level. Skills allow it minor specialization, but even that's still generally split across half the perks in the game, such as its first two choices being options of faster reloads for weapons from either the quicker perks (Commando, Gunslinger and SWAT) or the heavier ones (Sharpshooter, Support and Demolitionlist). Another potential problem with it as well is that the weapon you spawn with when playing as the perk is any one of the other nine perks' starting weapons chosen completely random, so it's a crapshoot as to whether you'll even start with a weapon you actually specialized your skills towards. If your team already has a good set of varied perks, the Survivalist is good for supporting them all at once (e.g. keeping health up for players who still have pretty high health while the dedicated Medic focuses on more heavily-injured teammates, without sacrificing raw power to keep enemies off of your teammates in the first place) and letting the player in question use whatever they want while doing so, which also makes it perfect for messing around with random weapon combinations that don't fit together normally in solo play, but if you want or need to do something more specific, you're better off just taking the perk that's dedicated to that.

</li><li> Back in the day, this was a huge problem for hybrids in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, especially in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusEnvironment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusEnvironment">Player Versus Environment</a> gameplay. Druids made for completely awful tanks, physical DPS, magic DPS and were also slightly subpar in healing. Shaman could heal okay, but again, didn't deal much damage. Paladins also had an unimpressive damage output, and weren't good at soaking up damage, but they had the best buffs in the game, didn't need to use totems, and were arguably the best healers. The Burning Crusade expansion took care of most of the deficiencies until basically they became specialized and differentiated from the basic healer, the priest. Now, the 'pure' classes like the Mage, Warlock and Rogue are frustrated that they do not add much versatility, and they do not excel over the supposed 'master of none' classes. <br/><br/>In addition, this was a potential pitfall of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou">talent system</a>, especially before the Cataclysm expansion overhaul. To make a long story short, it was not a good sign to see a player with less than 51 points in their primary talent tree because this usually means that their character will lack a powerful top-tier talent for their primary task. Even with 51 points in a character's primary "spec" it was still possible for a player to overlook crucial talents considered mandatory for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">Crippling Overspecialization</a> in either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusEnvironment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusEnvironment">PVE</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer">PvP</a>. This issue also created complaints about being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplacentGamingSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplacentGamingSyndrome">"restricted to cookie cutter specs"</a> to perform optimally. For some builds, rudimentary talents in the secondary trees were too good to ignore. <br/><br/>Blizzard finally prevented this with Mists of Pandaria by ripping out the talent system completely. You now pick your role which specializes you immediately. The few talents left to choose from are "situational" abilities that players may or may not need. This of course prompted cries of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">They Changed It, Now It Sucks!</a>. Supporters of this new post-talent system say you can choose 6 (out of a total of 18) very useful skills, as opposed to 12-14 (out of 50+) kinda-sorta useful skills. As an added bonus, the skills in each tier of the Mists of Pandaria talent tree often change a core skill in different ways. For example, the first tier of Hunter talents, unlocked at level 15, all change the Disengage skill (you leap backwards to get out of your enemy's range). There's Posthaste (temporarily increase running speed after you Disengage), Narrow Escape (trap nearby enemies when you Disengage) and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Chimaera (reduces the cooldown on Disengage, allowing you to use it more often).
<ul><li> In <em>Warlords of Draenor</em>, Blizzard changed the secondary stats on items, and added "Versatility", a stat which basically means a % boost to damage, healing and defense. To keep versatility from becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll">One Stat to Rule Them All</a>, its effect is weaker than other stats, but this made versatility the least desirable stat for raiders. As each of the roles (DPS, healer, tank) only cares about one of the three benefits that versatility grants, it was better to focus on other stats that granted a specific bonus.
</li></ul></li><li> The Assassin Class in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline">Ragnarok Online</a></em>. He sucks at PvP, isn't that useful in WoE, can hardly beat any boss monster and pretty much his only specialty is grinding alone in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusEnvironment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusEnvironment">PvE</a>. Only that other classes such as the Hunter are <em>much</em> better at that, too. At least it used to be that way. With newer updates, the Assassin gained effectiveness. His rebirth class, the Assassin Cross, is the complete opposite and has been accused of being overpowered quite often.
<ul><li> The Super Novice class can pick any skills from the first-tier classes freely, making them a neat side-character. Unfortunately, they are limited to novice-only weapons (meaning they can take Archer skills but can't use a bow), and more cripplingly, retain Novice-level health and mana pools. They're the weakest character in the game, but they're an "Expanded Class", which Gravity has made clear are not intended to be balanced.
<ul><li> At top levels magic-oriented Super Novices can become immune to ranged or melee physical attacks and have near-instant spellcasting at the same time, which makes them able to do some burst damage in PvP if they get the jump on the enemy. Still, their health pools usually prevent them from surviving the return damage.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The balance (sorcerer) class in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wizard101" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wizard101">Wizard 101</a></em> is this, having buffs and traps for every other school and some multipurpose ones, as well as having a few spells that mimic those of other school's such as their unique healing spell.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy">much-hated</a> M3 Lee in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfTanks">World of Tanks</a></em> suffers from this status. This tier 4 medium tank has only the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixedForwardFacingWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixedForwardFacingWeapon">hull-mounted gun</a> as a usable weapon (very much like a tank destroyer) while its turret is unusable. Subsequently, this tank cannot fulfill the roles of either a tank destroyer or a medium tank. The positioning of its gun means that the tank must turn its entire body, making it too cumbersome for aggressive flanking attacks suitable for mediums. Furthermore, it still retains the unusable turret that can be shot at and is highly visible, preventing it from successfully ambushing foes like a tank destroyer. Coupled with the fact that it has mediocre penetration, armor, speed, and agility (at best) the M3's inability to fulfill a specific role sufficiently makes it one of the worst tanks in the game.
</li><li> The undead Doom Howler demon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NexusWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NexusWar">Nexus Clash</a></em> can soak lots of damage, sneak around the map sniping people with charged attacks, put nasty debuffs on enemies, summon minions, and use battle magic - but never quite as well as the other five types of demon, each of which is the master of one of those abilities.

<ul><li> You want to achieve a balanced research in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarRuler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarRuler">Star Ruler</a></em>. While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">Crippling Overspecialization</a> invites counters, spreading your research too widely will result in more focused opponents rolling over your forces with tougher ships, ships that can regenerate faster than you can hurt them or ships that can blow yours up easily.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Homeworld2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Homeworld2">Homeworld 2</a></em>, frigates, especially Vaygr frigates, are rather hard to find a tactical niche for. The core problem is that they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors">scissors in a game with rocks but no paper</a>: Heavier capital ships aren't useful against strikecraft and corvettes, but extremely useful against frigates and capital ships, while the lighter strikecraft and corvettes are moderately usefull against everything. As such, no type of frigate can handle anything bigger, even in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a>, while they can't catch (and can, at a cost, be zerg-rushed by) lighter ships. They could be used to protect bigger ships against smaller ships, but other small ships can do that too <em>without</em> getting slaughtered by enemy capital ships.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/WorldInConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/WorldInConflict">World in Conflict</a></em>: Medium tanks tend to be this. They aren't anywhere as strong or durable as heavy tanks, and they're also not as cheap, expendable or mobile as light tanks. The medium tank's special anti-infantry attack is also much less useful than the light tank's missile, with the result being that the medium is almost never used by players. Medium AA vehicles and armored transports can also fall into this trope, as they have the versatility of being able to target both air and ground units, but lack the effectiveness of tanks or dedicated anti-air.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XWing">X-Wing</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <em>B-Wing</em> expansion forces this upon the humble Y-Wing. The Y-Wing was slower and less maneuverable than the X-Wing or especially the A-Wing, but had its niche with heavier armor and shielding and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">a larger payload of missiles</a>, alongside being the only one of the three to have ion cannons for disabling enemy craft. Then came the B-Wing, which did everything the Y-Wing does better - faster and more maneuverable (not quite on the level of the other two, but still a noticeable improvement) with similar durability, an even larger missile payload, and not only also having ion cannons, but having <em>three</em> of each cannon to the Y-Wing's two. At that point the only advantage the Y-Wing has over the B-Wing is a more agreeable placement of those cannons (in-line with the nose on the Y-Wing, versus spread out across the tips of the long wings for the B-Wing), which is negligible in any cases except being at knife-fight distance from another fighter.
</li><li> In the sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TIEFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TIEFighter">TIE Fighter</a></em>, the TIE Avenger is one of the fighters obtained by the midgame. It's the ship that Vader's personal craft was the prototype for, a TIE fighter that was designed to traditional fighter standards rather than an engine with guns strapped to it. In its own levels, it's not really an example, as it performs quite well until you obtain the TIE Defender and stacks up well against an X-Wing. However, in-universe, it's considered an example of this: the Imperial combat doctrine is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">We Have Reserves</a>, where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">standard TIE and TIE Interceptor</a> excel but the Avenger is too expensive to do, while missions that <em>did</em> require a smaller number of more powerful fighters would use the Defender instead, since the Defender is one of the greatest space-superiority vessels ever made while the Avenger is only decent. It says something that there were fewer Avengers made than Defenders, even though the Defender is the more expensive one.
</li><li> In-universe, this also befalls the T-Wing, which was introduced in <em>TIE Fighter</em>. Designed as a replacement for the A-Wing interceptor, it ended up combining the A-Wing's lack of armor or shielding with the X-Wing's lesser speed and maneuverability; the only upside was that it also had similar missile counts to the more-heavily-armed X-Wing. The Alliance ended up sticking with the A-Wing for its role and just sold off their T-Wings to make a profit, where it nevertheless became popular and useful among the neutral parties who bought them.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishPeople">Boron</a> fighter ships in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X">X-Universe</a></em> series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">Wide Open Sandbox</a> space combat/trading games. They have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">shielding and speed of Split ships</a>, but aren't anywhere near as fast. They have the firepower of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Argon ships</a>, but lack the energy reserves to fire their weapons. The ships can mount <em>only</em> energy weapons, and the energy weapons that they mount are all horrible energy hogs like the Ion Disruptor, making their tiny energy reserves even more painful (with one exception, the Skate is the only fighter in the Boron arsenal to mount the Energy Bolt Chaingun, and even then its cargo bay is not big enough to store its corresponding ammunition to last in a dogfight). Their only redeeming features are their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShip">looks</a> and their relatively large cargo hold to spam missiles from, though their cargo capacity is still nowhere near as big as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Teladi</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetter">ships</a>. However, their capital ships do <em>not</em> suffer from this, carrying overwhelming anti-capital ship firepower and fairly good shielding and speed, though at the cost of pathetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointDefenseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointDefenseless">anti-fighter defenses</a>; good thing you can simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks">smash the capital ship into the fighters</a> or enabled 10x time acceleration and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">watch the fighters plow into your hull</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechWarrior">MechWarrior Living Legends</a></em>, the "Prime" variant of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> is often based on the original loadout from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">original boardgame</a>, where most mechs carry weapons for any range, but don't particularly excel at any. These loadouts vary from very good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a> (such as the "Warhammer" and "Mad Cat" heavy mechs) to borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a> master-of-none mechs like the Bushwacker Prime, which has so little firepower at any given range that twenty players in Bushwacker Primes couldn't kill each other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">before running out of ammo and the mission timer ending</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64">Nintendo 64</a> helicopter game <em>Chopper Attack</em> had this befall the "AGAM', a combined air-to-air and air-to-ground missile. It simplifies things significantly by having one missile type that can take on any sort of target rather than having to constantly switch between dedicated AA or AG weapons, but this comes at the downside of a single AGAM costing almost as much as one AAM and one AGM <em>combined</em> — for the cost, one of each of the dedicated missiles is more effective than a single multi-purpose one, since it's only 200 more bucks at that point to be able to effectively kill two targets instead of just one. The same befalls the homing cluster bomb, which adds homing capability to a weapon that least <em>needs</em> homing capability, thus also giving it a weakness to flares that everyone from the third mission on can throw out when needed, with no upgrades to damage dealt or how fast it goes over the regular cluster bomb, yet it costs <em>five times</em> as much.

This was probably the reason she was discontinued from the series (that and being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthernBelle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthernBelle">Southern Belle</a>).

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder9');">    Tabletop Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder9" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pandemic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pandemic">Pandemic</a></em> has one role literally called The Generalist, which has five actions instead of the usual four, and no special powers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> edition 3.5 has several:
<ul><li> The half-elf and half-orc races were supposed to be a midpoint between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a> human and the more specialized elf and orc. In practice, this translated to them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorMansSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorMansSubstitute">getting weaker versions of what elves and orcs could do.</a> Half-elf bonuses were too poor to focus them down any path, while half-orc penalties were still too high to bother playing anything that an orc couldn't do better. If you wanted something versatile, you played a human, and if you wanted something specialized, you played an elf (or an elf subrace) or orc. Later editions would flesh them out a bit more to give them real focuses: half-elves got social skills, while half-orcs lost their mental penalties.
</li><li> Medium armor. All the speed penalties of heavy armor while offering, at best, one extra point of AC bonus compared to light armor. At worst, they offer protection equal to light armors while being heavier, with lower maximum dexterity bonuses and higher skill penalties. The only decent medium armor is a heavy armor made of Mithral, which makes it count as a medium armor.
</li><li> In optimization communities, the term "multiple-ability dependency", or MAD, refers to this. Specifically, some classes require only a few good stats, while others require several. Invariably, a class that requires good all-around stats is seen as inferior to one that requires only one or two really good stats and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat">can dump everything else</a>. For instance, barbarians only really need Strength and Constitution for melee fighting, while paladins need that, along with Wisdom for casting and Charisma for their paladin abilities, meaning the paladin tends to fall behind in sheer damage and tanking ability.
</li><li> The Hexblade, of Complete Warrior, was an early attempt at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a> base class. It failed miserably, since the designers badly overestimated how strong the Hexblade's various abilities were. On the physical side, it couldn't wear any armor lighter than a chain shirt, its Fortitude save sucked, it didn't get any feats or abilities to boost its combat capabilities, and its sole unique power was the rather poor and limited Curse debuff. On the magic side, it was limited to fourth-level spells (the same as Paladins and Rangers, who no one would call caster classes), and the need to buff its combat stats often left its Charisma lagging. The result was a fragile combatant that couldn't hit very hard and was outdone in casting by a sorcerer of half its level. On top of that, the Duskblade proved to be a better <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a> in almost every way, with much more focused design and stronger abilities overall. Even the class's creator apologized for it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">giving the class a much-needed</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150920132907/http://community.wizards.com/comment/13411551">unofficial fix<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that became widely-used. Most Hexblade guides, even those using the fixed version, focus on somewhat incidental elements or alternate class features (for instance, their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeastmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeastmaster">familiar</a> is surprisingly pretty strong) to give them some kind of niche.
</li><li> Certain official <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a> tend to become this. Most of the time, when trying to mix two classes, players prefer to either use a prestige class like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Eldritch Knight</a> to advance both, or use one class to mimic the other (for instance, a Cloistered Cleric with the Trickery domain can fill in for a Rogue pretty well). The designers took longer to figure this out. A quick look through the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a> Campaign Setting</em> reveals a multitude of characters with builds like Jezz the Lame - as a drow Rogue 6/Sorcerer 6, he's considered CR 14, despite possessing no spells above third-level, a Sneak Attack that deals 3d6 damage, and only thirty-six hit points. Storm Silverhand, though, is the absolute reigning queen of this. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">formidable</a> Bard of Shadowdale is a Chosen of Mystra Rogue 1/Fighter 4/Bard 8/Sorcerer 12/Harper Scout 3 - in layman's terms, a character with a CR equal to many an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>, who would probably get eaten by a bog-standard beholder. Even later on in the edition's life, many sample characters in the second Dungeon Master's Guide were something like Fighter 5/Sorcerer 5, when Fighter 1/Sorcerer 6/Eldritch Knight 3 (which isn't even close to the best <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a> build one could make) would be better in just about every way.
</li><li> The monk suffered heavily from this. It had abilities based on straightforward melee combat, but it was mediocre at it compared to a barbarian, fighter, or warblade due to low attack bonus, damage, and reach. It had a good skill list, but only a handful of points to spend compared to a rogue or a bard. It had the needed skills for scouting and mobility, but rogues, spellthieves, and scouts did, too, and had trap and lock removal skills that meant they could better utilize them. It got free combat maneuver feats such as trips and grapples, but a fighter could take those feats, too, and would be much better at them due to a better attack bonus and strength. It had abilities based on improving its unarmored AC, but they were so minor any character capable of wearing armor would come out ahead, other unarmored characters like wizards could outstrip it with magic, and its hitpoints were at best average. It had a smattering of other spell-like or minor abilities, but they were all limited in usage and didn't compare to the versatility of a wizard or cleric, or even a character with a few magic items. It attempted to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MageKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MageKiller">a caster-killer</a>, but lacked anything to actually threaten a mage played to any degree of competence. And even as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wuxia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wuxia">Wuxia-style</a> character, the swordsage was better in every way.
</li><li> The soulknife was in a similar boat to the monk. Its primary class feature was summoning a magic weapon that upgraded itself as the soulknife levelled, but it scaled poorly compared to other summoned weapons, weapons crafted by an artificer or wizard, or even weapons simply bought. As a pure combat character, it was too lightly-armored and its attacks were too weak to contest a fighter. It gained limited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a>, but had almost nothing to do with them compared to a psychic warrior. Its overall fighting style leaned towards mobility, but its Bladewind was based on standing still, and it could throw its mind blade, but only once per turn, meaning no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlechetteStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlechetteStorm">Flechette Storm</a>. As a sneaky character, it didn't have enough skill points or the right abilities to fill the role of a rogue. It had Psychic Strike for burst damage and sneak attacks, but this was too cumbersome for straightforward combat and too weak to be used for assassination. It had Knife to the Soul for stat damage to weaken casters or lobotomize warriors, but its damage was too low to avoid the problem of either class simply taking the hit and reducing the soulknife to hamburger meat. The result was a class that pulled in every direction and failed at all of them, with even its primary class feature being outdone by, of all things, an alternate class feature for the psychic warrior (which was also tougher, harder-hitting, and infinitely more versatile).
</li><li> The bard in 3.0 fell pretty hard into this. In straightforward combat, it was scarcely better than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a>, with similar base attack, hit points, and weapons to the rogue, but no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStab" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStab">Back Stab</a>. As a skill-oriented character, it possessed a strong list, but only four skill points to spend them on (of which two had to go to Perform and Concentration to make songs and spells work) and few congruent class features. As a caster, it was limited to 6th-level spells, cast in the worst possible way, couldn't wear armor, had no unique spells, and advanced slowly. Its main unique trait, bardsong, pointed them to the role of party support, but its actual effects ranged from gimmicky to totally inconsequential. Being a caster was good, but compared to a sorcerer of the same level, the 3.0 bard had basically no functional advantages. 3.5 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBuff">largely pulled the bard out of this</a>, giving it some extra skill points and new spells, reworking several bardsongs, adding new features, and giving it a fair bit of splatbook support, which allowed the bard to find a niche as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFace">a social-skills juggernaut</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">Difficult, but Awesome</a> buffer and indirect caster.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedMage">Theurge-type</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass">Prestige Classes</a> are usually seen as this, only becoming remotely passable because of the inherent power of spellcasting. The problem is that they require taking multiple levels in multiple classes, which usually don't have much synergy with each other (being able to cast cleric and wizard spells isn't really impressive when you can only cast one at a time and they're worse than the regular stuff), they often require advancing multiple stats when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll">the lack of need to do this is usually an upside for a caster</a>, and they tend to lack features that would allow one to use those abilities together. The standard mystic theurge has to deal with the downsides of being a cleric (relies on a deity) and a wizard (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">can't wear armor</a>), while also being at least three levels behind on both classes - particularly ruinous when you start the class, at which you have worse casting than a bard or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidekick">a cohort</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">Fochlucan lyrist</a> is more powerful, but its oddball requirements mean that it torpedoes both sides of its advancement, requiring levels in three different classes and only boosting parts of two of them. Both the true necromancer and the yathinshree reduce their theurge advancement even further in exchange for necromantic abilities, but those abilities are about on the level of stuff a regular necromancer could do anyway. The only theurge-type classes to be seen as good are the anima mage and the ultimate magus, both of which only require a one-level dip away from your main advancement and have multiple abilities to help synergize them.
</li><li> Prestige classes meant to fill a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a> role often struggled in this regard, likely due to using the somewhat underwhelming Eldritch Knight as a baseline. The early years of the game seemed to enjoy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerupLetdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerupLetdown">halving casting advancement</a>, and sometimes even reducing Base Attack, which usually meant a character who could barely cast and wasn't that great at fighting, either. The Green Star adept and rage mage had the misfortune of getting both, in exchange for abilities that didn't really help them do either. Others, like the bladesinger, also had extensive feat requirements that made qualifying needlessly difficult and necessitated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell">a very problematic early game</a>. The only one to really avert this was the abjurant champion, which boasted easy requirements, full advancement of base attack and casting, and useful features... albeit at the price of being only five levels long.
</li><li> The arcane trickster prestige class ran into similar issues. It was meant to be a mixture of a rogue and a caster, but its requirements (+2d6 Sneak Attack and at least 3rd-level arcane spells) meant you would have to be, at minimum, a Wizard 5/Rogue 3 to get into it, which meant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell">spending eight levels as a crappy mixture before you could qualify</a>. While it did advance Sneak Attack and casting, being a caster meant no armor, which was worse when it also had wizard HD and base attack, so using that sneak attack in combat was not easy. While it gained the ability to use its skills at range, this was torpedoed by the fact that it also dropped skill points per level from 8 to 4, meaning you couldn't advance a lot of your rogue skills. And while it gained the Impromptu Sneak Attack ability, it was incredibly limited in usage and an Improved Invisibility spell could do basically the same thing for nowhere near the effort. The only real bright spot was being able to use Sneak Attack to boost the damage of certain spells (damage that might make up for losing three caster levels), and even in that regard, the later unseen seer class basically did the same thing but better.
</li><li> The ogre mage enemy fell into this, which led to it being the target of <a class="urllink" href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dd/20060721a">an article specifically designed to restat it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Intended as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser">Genius Bruiser</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a> that combined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareRaceRoundClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareRaceRoundClass">ogre strength and the power of a caster</a>, it ended up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">rather poor hitpoints</a> and fighting skills, with spells that ranged from useless to redundant to good-but-only-once-per-day and a smattering of other generic abilities that didn't offer it much of a niche. This owed largely to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact">having been translated rather literally from its 2e stats</a>. Fortunately, the revision, and the ogre mages in later editions, tend to be more powerful.
</li><li> The Expert class is a fairly deliberate example of this. It's capable of treating any ten skills as class skills, meaning it can train itself for just about any job. However, the Expert lacks other class features and its stats are mediocre, meaning that while it can train in any skill, it's no better at that skill than another class that simply starts with it. And on top of that, the Factotum and Savant classes treat <em>all</em> skills as class skills, so even mixing and matching skillsets from other classes isn't worth it. Few really complain about this, though, as the Expert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">isn't intended to represent an actual adventurer</a>; it's meant to be taken by well-trained NPCs that have enough unique skills to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">not be commoners</a> but still don't fit any of the classic classes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> 5th Edition:
<ul><li> The default Human race. It gives +1 to all stats (in a game where you rarely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll">care about more than three of them</a>) and little else. The Variant Human, on the other hand,is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxersDelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxersDelight">Min Maxers Delight</a> bordering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>.
</li><li> Humans in earlier editions also frequently fell into this. They could play any class and lacked a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelCap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelCap">Level Cap</a>, but they had no bonuses or unique abilities whatsoever. Even assuming you weren't playing in one of the many groups that houseruled out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic">racial class restrictions and level caps</a>, there was no reason to play a human unless it was the only possible option, since no matter what, they'd be outclassed by races that possessed actual advantages.
</li><li> The pre-revision ranger is generally seen as this - not as good with weapons as a fighter, not as good at scouting and sneaking as a rogue, not as good at casting and nature stuff as a druid, and not as versatile as a bard. The revised Unearthed Arcana ranger is considerably better in just about every way, thankfully.
</li><li> The "All Classes" build, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/PuffinForest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/PuffinForest">Abserd</a> (see the Web Animation folder). Multiclass one level of each class. You will be able to wield nearly any weapon or armour and have a lot of skill proficiences and cantrips, but without an extra attack or sneak attack bonus you are poor at physical combat, and you will be a poor spellcaster because you'll have a limited selection of spells and spell slots compared to a "real" spellcaster and with a poor spell save DC, you'll find they rarely work to boot.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> has a couple of units that fall under this, although it's fully possible for an entire army to become this if point allocation is stretched too thin. The rule of thumb is that if you absolutely need to fulfil a specific role like taking out an enemy's vehicles, it's better to dedicate a specialist squad or unit to that task; trying to load all of your squads with some level of anti-vehicular firepower is expensive, generally not as effective, and will leave you outmatched and outnumbered in the face of combined arms tactics. That being said, there's nothing wrong with attaching some versatility wherever possible, although this is heavily dependent on how each unit is to be deployed.
<ul><li> The 5th edition Space Marines codex fell under this for a number of years. Although Space Marines are more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a> faction, the vanilla codex was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">overshadowed by the codices written for specific chapters like the Blood Angels</a>, which had all of the usual Space Marine stuff in addition to having better vehicles and some of the most powerful close-combat units and characters in the game. 6th edition countered this by providing specializations for each chapter, although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">the Ultramarines</a> still try to fulfill this (in practice, their rules lend themselves best to devastating alpha strikes supported by powerful special characters).
</li><li> To their name, the humble Tactical Squad is the epitome of this trope; each trooper is armed with a Bolter (good against hordes of infantry), a Bolt Pistol (allowing them to fire their weapon and charge in the same turn), Frag Grenades (negating any cover bonuses when they charge an enemy) and Krak Grenades (allowing them to engage even heavy vehicles). They also all have Power Armor, and usually one trooper will be armed with a close-range special weapon (such as a flamer) and a heavy anti-tank weapon (usually a Missile Launcher or Lascannon). They are also a troop choice, meaning they also fulfill your basic minimum requirements no matter what your army is built to be. The problem is none of those weapons excel at what they do; the average space marine can't put out enough attacks in close combat to make it worth charging anyone, krak grenades only give them the ability to engage tanks (you still need 5s and 6s on a D6 to actually inflict damage against most things), and the special and heavy weapons they have do not put out enough shots to deal respectable damage to their intended targets. And prior to the Combat Squad rule, the heavy and special weapon typically couldn't even be fired at the same target (the Special Weapon usually need to be extremely close to the target, while the heavy weapon can't shoot after moving; you had to be within spitting distance of the enemy to actually fire both at the same target, and usually by then they would have already charged you). If you wanted close-range, you'd play as Assault Marines; if you wanted anti-tank infantry, you'd pick a Devastator Squad with a Meltagun; if you wanted more wounds to survive, you'd pick a squad of Terminators and a Land Raider. Everything a Tactical Squad could do, a dedicated squad could do much better.
</li><li> Eldar Guardian Defenders, the generalist unit in an army of specialists, can theoretically be kitted out to provide support firepower. The problem is that they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedsters</a> armed with anti-infantry guns that shoot about as far as shotguns, which mean that they get outranged in firefights or get charged once in range. They're a bit better with a heavy weapons platform (which they have to take), but that in turn means that about 90% of the squad will generally be sitting around doing nothing, either because of the aforesaid range issues or because the heavy weapon is targeting a vehicle. They are also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverShadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverShadowedByAwesome">Over Shadowed By Awesome</a>, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Dire Avengers</a> fulfill the same general infantry tactical niche, but do everything better than the Guardian Defenders do, from better weapon range to better armor to hitting their targets more often. The trade-off being that Dire Avengers cost more, are fielded in smaller numbers, and cannot not take heavy weapon platforms.
</li><li> The Imperium's Mars-class battlecruisers have a decent gun loadout, including a Nova Cannon, and carry a good number of attack craft, but excel in neither the direct fire nor carrier field. They are widely considered undergunned and production has stopped for them.
</li><li> Chaos Space Marines have taken this slot - intended to be a dark version of the Space Marines, their aging codex and power creep in the game in general have left them worse at mobility, shooting and assault than their Jack of all Trades Loyalist brethren. Like the 6th Edition Space Marines, the Chaos Space Marines received a slew of updates late in 7th Edition in the form of new psychic powers, formations, and Legion-specific wargear and rules to make them more fluffy and (in the case of some Legions such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">Death Guard</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenseFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenseFreak">Emperor's Children</a>) semi-competitive.
</li><li> Troop Choices in general are this. They are suppose to be the bread and butter of your army, and thus are not really geared towards anything (but also would not leave you wanting for anything should the rest of your army bite it). Before the advent of different "Detachments", there was only one Force Organization chart, which worked around the idea that at least 2 of your choices would be dedicated to Troops as a balancing factor. This meant that in low point level games, a good chunk of your points were siphoned into troops, while this would be less of an issue in high point level games (where due to the amount of firepower present, you really did need the redundant specialist units). Once new Force Organization charts came out due to different detachments, this balance was also thrown out the window, ending up with many new players wondering exactly why some troop choices existed at all. The Detachment systems would try to remedy this by providing special rules (often obscenely good ones) to troop choices as an incentive to field them.
</li></ul></li><li> The Eclipse Caste of the Solar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a> (and their Infernal and Abyssal variants, the Fiends and Moonshadows) are both this and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinmaxersDelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinmaxersDelight">Minmaxer's Delight</a>, for entirely different reasons. On the one hand, several of their Caste abilities are woefully underdeveloped mechanically, making their core role as diplomats incredibly difficult to fulfill. On the other hand, their anima power allows them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">learn the Charms of other beings</a>, creating unintentional and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">game-breaking</a> synergies that no one else has access to.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Digimon">Digimon</a> Collectible Card Game, Vaccine Digimon are strong against Virus Digimon, Virus Digimon are strong against Data Digimon, and Data Digimon are strong against nothing in particular. To compensate, Data Digimon have higher stats overall.
</li><li> Halfling teams in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BloodBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BloodBowl">Blood Bowl</a></em> consist of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> treemen, and the not-so-mighty halflings. Halflings have the movement speed of dwarfs comboed with the strength and durability of goblins, while lacking the former's team-wide invulnerability (due to ridiculously high armor and high number of blitzers with Block) and the latter's penchant for bringing illegal weaponry (bombs, chainsaws, pogo sticks... the works) onto the field as equalizers. Halflings only get general skills on doubles, meaning they'll be eating dirt a <em>lot</em>, and their treemen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FastballSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FastballSpecial">launchers</a> have a tendency to take root and become immobile. They're widely considered to be one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Teams</a>, the other being the Ogres, and only played as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">Self-Imposed Challenge</a>. That said, their discount on master chefs is worth it when you end up stealing all your opponent's rerolls... Even if they <em>do</em> crush half your roster into a fine red paste as payback.
</li><li> Most of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>'s various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> and other combat are specialized to a degree, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> scout 'Mechs and hovercraft, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> assault units and main battle tanks. Even main-line combat units are designed to favor power or speed for a specific reason. Some designs, however, are so average that they ultimately can't accomplish much.
<ul><li> The SHD-2H <em>Shadow Hawk</em> is a 55-ton 'Mech that has average speed, average armor, and average firepower for its size. However, this means that while it can fill a hole in a unit, it can't actually <em>do</em> anything effectively. It is too slow to act as a scout and lacks the agility to flank, but does not have the firepower to do more than plug gaps in a line of battle. It suffers from terrible range overlap, where half of its weapons will work well at one range but not the other, and ultimately means it does mediocre damage at every range. The <em>Shadow Hawk's</em> greatest problem is that it comes in the exact same weight class and similar Battle Value to the WVR-6R <em>Wolverine</em> and the GRF-1N <em>Griffin</em>, the former a proper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a> that's faster and deadlier close up and the latter much better as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRangeFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRangeFighter">Long-Range Fighter</a>.
</li><li> The STN-3K <em>Sentinel</em> weighs 40 tons and moves at an average speed for that size. It carries modest armor and a small selection of weapons, but suffers from the same problems as the aforementioned <em>Shadow Hawk</em> by having its largest and most powerful weapon suffer inaccuracy at short range, which is the only range that its small missile launcher and laser can reach. It is generally not guilty of any major battlefield sins aside from not being able to fill a useful role, which is in some ways the ultimate failure.
</li><li> The SR1-O <em>Strider</em> is another 40-ton machine that, in spite of its good armor and acceptable speed, is considered something of a joke by the fanbase, due to its nature as a highly expensive and experimental Inner Sphere Omnimech with the ability to be reconfigured for multiple roles...and not actually being much good in <em>any</em> of them. It can choose to be a slow and defenseless scout, a wimpy close-fighter, or an underpowered missile boat.
</li><li> The Clan-built <em>Thresher</em> is explicitly noted to be one of these in-universe. It is sarcastically considered the natural result of democracy, committees, and compromise, and is a Clan heavy 'Mech that doesn't kick ass and take names the way Clan heavies generally do. While it isn't a complete failure, its generalized nature makes it so mediocre (it's too expensive to even be a basic trooper design) that it has ended up doing very little other than sit around far away from the front lines and look lumpy.
</li><li> The UM-R60 <em>Urbanmech</em>, of course, is infamous (and beloved) in the fandom for this. A borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a>, the 'Urbie' is a light 'mech with a comically undersized engine and a comically oversized main gun, which it can only fire ten times before becoming incapable of attacking. Its six tonnes of armour is decent for a 30-ton 'mech, but that's still akin to saying that it's made out of slightly more tear-resistant paper than average. Outside of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SituationalSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SituationalSword">being deployed in</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanWarfare">Urban Warfare</a>, the <em>Urbanmech</em>'s only selling point is that it is very cheap to deploy.
</li><li> The infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformingMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformingMecha">Land-Air Mechs</a> suffer from the fact that while they're both mech and fighter (depending on model, sometimes an intermediate mode too), they dont make a good example of either. They're much slower than a dedicated aerospace fighter and can't carry as many weapons and armor as a dedicated battlemech. They are best used for scouting.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Iron Chain cards inare intended to combine a strategy of attacking, Burn damage, and milling the opponent's Deck to be flexible and overwhelm the opponent. Unfortunately for them, they're pretty bad at all three. Iron Chain Repairman is their only non-Synchro attacker, with an average-at-best 1600 ATK, while ace Iron Chain Dragon has a good-but-not-great 2500, plus an ATK bonus that might get 1000 points for one turn if you've got a lot of Chains in the Graveyard. You can try to weaken your opponent's cards with Iron Chain Snake, but even then, doing so is incredibly slow and cumbersome. Burn cards are pretty sparse; Iron Chain Blaster does 800 damage a turn at the cost of a Monster, which is pretty lame since some cards can do 500 a turn with no other requirements, while Iron Chain Repairman and Paralyzing Chain do 300 damage per activation, which is barely even chip damage. And milling the Deck? Well, there's destroying a Monster with Iron Chain Snake, which has all the problems above, there's Poison Chain, which knocks off only a few cards a turn and stops you from attacking, and Dragon, which knocks off just three cards per attack. All this, combined with how tiny the archetype is, means that the Iron Chains will do just enough attacking to stop them from using stall cards, just enough burn damage to make their attacking force insufficient, and just enough milling to give your opponent Graveyard resources.
</li><li> In the early game, this was a problem with many high-level monsters. The designers seemed to believe that a monster with good stats in both ATK and DEF was inherently more powerful than something with only one good stat, which led to, for instance, Dark Magician (2500/2100) requiring two tributes over Summoned Skull (2500/1200) requiring one. It was true that Dark Magician's higher DEF was objectively an advantage - but it was also largely negligible, since the monster would only ever use one stat at a time. You'd almost never run into a situation where Dark Magician's extra 900 DEF would come in handy, since if you were playing it in DEF, your opponent would likely have something that could kill it in ATK, and if that was true, it would die just as fast in DEF. The only time that stat would come up is if the opponent used something like Block Attack to force your monster to DEF, which simply didn't make up for the extra Tribute. This was particularly true in early games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YuGiOhTheDuelistsOfTheRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YuGiOhTheDuelistsOfTheRoses">Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses</a></em>, where both ATK and DEF were taken into the card's cost - a 1600/0 like Dragon Zombie had the same cost as an 800/800.
</li><li> Vehicroids. They have cards based on offense (Truckroid, Steamroid, Drillroid), defense (Decoyroid, Gyroid, Jetroid), and recovery (Expressroid, Ambulanceroid, Rescueroid), but the group of them have no real synergy between each other aside from a few combos that border on coincidental, and no real way to change up their strategy. It has several Fusions and a special Fusion card, but it only works on three of those fusions and only one is any good, and only one other card in the archetype supports a Fusion playstyle. None of them are anything above mediocre, and there's almost no relation between their effects, making even sussing out a playstyle for them difficult, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Rank10YGO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Rank10YGO">one frustrated Youtuber</a> noted.
</li></ul><div class="indent">"So what could have been done to make 'Roids better? I know I said this with Genex already, but I don't fucking know. With Genex, you could at least somewhat see the point of what they're supposed to be, but Roids are literally just random pack filler garbage thrown together as an archetype for some reason, and I can't deduce their win condition or goal or whatever from that!"
</div><ul><li> Flamvells have some cards based on offense, but of the bunch, only Firedog is notably strong for its level. They have several Burn-based cards, but the damage they inflict is pathetic and they often require some work to activate. They have a variety of Tuners with a variety of levels, but only two Synchros, both of which are mediocre. The Neo Flamvell sub-archetype focuses on banishing the opponent's Graveyard, but doesn't do so quickly enough to be disruptive, synergize with the rest of the deck, or have much of an endgame in doing so. Their best card is Rekindling, which allows for an impressive mass revival, but Rekindling doesn't actually support Flamvells; it supports Fire-types with 200 DEF, meaning other, stronger Fire archetypes can also use it (and because of those other archetypes, Rekindling is limited to one).
</li><li> The iconic Red-Eyes has had to deal with this quite a bit, due to Konami's rather odd habit of seemingly giving it a new focus with every wave of release, from burn to Fusion to Geminis to Equip-use to revival. The problem is that none of these strategies really synergize, nor are they fleshed-out individually enough to excel on their own merits. Compared to the far more well-focused Blue-Eyes and Dark Magician, Red-Eyes tends to struggle as a result.
</li><li> Many new players attempt to use decks based on the playstyles of characters in the anime, which suffer from this due to a mixture of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CCGImportanceDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CCGImportanceDissonance">CCG Importance Dissonance</a> and lack of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPokerEquation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPokerEquation">Magic Poker Equation</a>. The most infamous is Yugi's deck, which in the anime was a mixture of various smaller engines and archetypes that allowed for a good amount of flexibility and strategy. In the hands of real players, though, it becomes a complete joke, with many an erstwhile King of Games struggling to kludge something together when they draw nothing but Magnet Warrior support cards and only a Dark Magician to use them on. You're almost always better off with trying to run a deck based purely on one of these archetypes and played to its fullest.
</li></ul></li><li> Unlike the other, specialized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega Corps</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HcSvntDracones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HcSvntDracones">Hc Svnt Dracones</a></em> MarsCo does a bit of everything. This is represented in their educational system, characters with a scholarship from MarsCo can train in any proficiencies, but only up to two dots at character creation rather than the usual three. In addition, their ships have Omnislots where the other corps put weapons arrays, flak barriers, or drone bays on their ships. While that allows MarsCo ships more versatility and a greater ability to specialize from mission to mission it does make them more expensive.
</li><li> Creating master-of-none characters is a common beginner's error in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointBuildSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointBuildSystem">point build</a> tabletop RPGs such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions">Champions</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em>, especially perhaps among those with previous experience in class-and-level systems. Discovering that they can create characters who are strong <em>and</em> fast <em>and</em> skilled <em>and</em> other things, such players may get over-excited and take one of everything, and end up with characters who are mediocre at everything, while specialists have more fun.

In the first game, Majins are the best class in the game at practically everything, possessing massive stat growth, aptitude, and weapon affinities right off the bat, with their only "drawback" being that they take an awful lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a> to unlock. The second game toned them down by giving them low Movement range (which can be overcome), and a paltry throw range of ONE SQUARE (which cannot be enhanced). By the third game, their aptitudes affinities were made far below average, to the point where it was not worth the time fixing those issues to make them viable. The subsequent games have done little to improve Majins ever since.

However, his stats are so abysmal that there's really no point in using him at all, as even later units that join your clan have better stats. What's really crippling is the fact that the game will not even let you remove him from your party (short of killing him in a Jagd) so you'll have to endure his subparness for the whole game. He's likable enough that most people put up with him.

They can remotely hack like Specialists, but their Hack stat is terrible. They can melee attack like Rangers, but can't deal status effects or have the advanced skills that keep lategame melee-focused Rangers relevant. Bombard allows them to blow things up at range like the Grenadier's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeLauncher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeLauncher">Grenade Launcher</a>, but without the specialised grenades or perks Grenadiers get to use.

Since it becomes ever harder to put points into skills the higher level you go, it can be tempting to grab the low-hanging fruit instead. This spreading out of skills, however, can make things difficult in the lategame. This is further compounded by the fact that spellbook and item slots are shared among all the possible archetypes' needs. It's almost always better to specialise, and the ingame hints themselves suggest as much.

<ul><li> In <em>IV</em>, a number of units (Spearmen, Pikemen, Grenadiers, and Marines, for instance) ended up with a promotion tree that'd fit a defensive unit while having special bonuses to incentivize aggression and offense, or vice versa. This usually left a unit that kinda sucked at both.
</li><li> In <em>V</em>, this befalls several civs whose abilities don't synergize well, resulting in them being not as good at other civs with a more focused win condition. The Byzantine Empire is a fine example; it has two early unique units and a Religion that they can choose extra abilities for, but both early warfare and Religion development tie up a lot of resources in the early game, meaning Byzantium will pretty much have to give up on at least one (and making them mediocre against full-conquest civs like the Huns or Assyria, and full-Religion civs like the Celts or Ethiopia).

There's only a couple of differences between Orcs and High Men, but these (Shamans vs. Priests, Halberdiers vs. Pikemen, Wyvern Rider vs. Paladin) are worse across the board, so there is no reason whatsoever to take Orcs as your starting race. They make a decent conquest target for more warlike races (as their economy is identical to the High Men's - that is, they can build any building), but that's out of the player's control.

Unfortunately, it tends to instead combine the weaknesses of Paladins (being weak to anti-mounted units, having trouble with certain terrain) with the weaknesses of Generals (very slow, weak to anti-armor). That reduced movement also takes away one of the best traits of Paladin, namely, its ability to carry around slow units, because Great Knights are no faster than promoted foot units, and can actually be <em>slower</em> than a foot unit because of those movement penalties. Meanwhile, if all you want is pure power, the General outdoes the Great Knight due to better bonuses and stat caps. The only character recommended for Great Knight is Gilliam, who appreciates the mobility boost in the main campaign.
</li><li> Warrior in the DS games gets this, due to most of its focuses not really gelling properly. It combines the stat caps of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> with stat bases and growths that imply a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>, which generally means its theoretical advantage of high Defense never actually comes into play. It also suffers from this due to poor direction in its weapon types of axes and bows: of the axe-using classes, Berserker and Hero are both much faster, meaning Warrior's theoretical damage edge falls apart when it can't double, while Dracoknight is tankier and can fly, and of the bow-using classes, Sniper is both much faster <em>and</em> has a better bow rank, making it a better pick for shooting things down.

Most of these specialist classes come with some kind of penalty relative to the generic versions in a particular area, but because you can only realistically use a limited subset of the weapons or abilities potentially available anyway, it's generally better to chose a class/kit that gains bonuses in whatever skills or weapons you plan to actually use. This is an issue inherited from <em>AD&amp;D</em>, where the designers tended to balance out kits that gave bonuses to one thing by providing penalties to another, ignoring that players might simply not bother with the penalized skill.

It is severely lacking in high end complete sets compared to Light and Heavy armors, and only has one piece of "artifact" equipment in its class (the Ebony Mail) compared to the multiple pieces for Light and Heavy. Additionally, wearing one of the best Medium armor sets (Indoril) will make Ordinators (to whom that armor is sacred) try to kill on sight for the rest of the game. An attempt is made in <em>Tribunal</em> to avert this with Adamantium armor, but the ore is so rare and armor so expensive to have made that few players bother. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em>, medium armor was dropped entirely because of this.

Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelScaling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelScaling">Level Scaling</a>, enemies constantly get stronger, but a Magic Knight will level their magic more slowly than a pure caster, and spells do not scale with your level, so by the point you get the latest level of useful spells, enemies are likely going to have out-levelled them already. Plus there is the issue of balancing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Magicka</a>/Stamina/Health, which likely either means your character will have too little magicka to make spellcasting useful for more than a weak initial shot, too low of stamina to handle themselves decently in melee, and not enough health to reliably take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">even single hits</a> from more powerful enemies, especially dragons.

He uses elemental magic, nature summons, and has shapeshifting for melee. However, his magic is weaker than the sorceress', often with huge timers placed on them. His summons are limited to 1, 3, or 5 damaging minions, while the Necromancer can have somewhere around 40 skeletons total. His melee skills are up to the task, but since his were-forms have limited durations, he has to worry about turning back into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">human</a> mid-battle.

A lot of their skills are Holy, and they're capable of quite a bit of damage, especially with the "Heavenly Strength" ability that lets a Crusader <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHandedZweihander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHandedZweihander">wield a two-handed weapon with one hand</a>. However, they lack a lot of ranged options, their DPS isn't that high when compared to the Demon Hunter or the Witch Doctor, and their abilities frequently have long cooldowns. As a melee class, they're also incapable of matching the attack speed of Monks or the crowd-control ability of a Barbarian. A Crusader's skills with Shields and flails are capable of turning the Crusader into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">a defensive powerhouse</a>, but this is irrelevant on the harder difficulties of Torment mode. The result of all of this is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> that isn't that mighty, and fares poorly stacked up against the other character classes.

This made hybrids less powerful, as upgrading magic schools allowed the learning of new spells and enhanced old spells... though it also allowed some of them to become Masters of <em>Something</em>: yes, the archer might not be all that good a spellcaster, but being able to directly add to the damage done when attacking with a bow has its uses, the druid might only be second best in elemental or clerical magic, but can have more spell points than anyone, etc.

<ul><li> Kaidan Alenko avoids being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">The Load</a> in the first game only by lieu of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceSidequest">Romance Sidequest</a> and interesting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a>. He has biotics, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Liara</a> has better ones (including Singularity, one of the most overpowered moves in the game). He has tech abilities, but so do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Garrus</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench">Tali</a>. His weapon skills are the worst in the game (Tali, who in some ways is squishier than him, compensates for her similar weaknesses by having the highest shield ceiling in the game as well as being able to upgrade from basic pistols to shotguns), and he can only wear light armor (Garrus, in addition to being more durable, is able to upgrade to Medium Armor). Manually tweaking his stats can turn him into a versatile and powerful backup character, but most people only use him early on and dump him on the <em>Normandy</em> for the rest of the game.
</li><li> The main result for Kaidan's lack of use in actual combat is because it's an inherent problem of the Sentinel class in the first game, undoubtedly the weakest class available. It was meant to be a tech/biotic mix, but overall squishiness combined with lack of damage output meant it was just a worse Adept. It had tech powers that could lock down enemies, but they replaced biotic abilities that could do the same thing better. It did get biotic powers that once again could lock down enemies, but they didn't get the really powerful ones. They could use pistols, but their version of the talent for pistols (in that they gained the usual benefits through their passive skill) was weaker than any other class's version, and they didn't get any other weapons to make up for this. Tech/Biotics also don't complement each other as well as Combat does with either, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment">both are primarily set on making enemies vulnerable</a> while Combat actually kills them. In the Sentinel's case, making them helpless didn't matter if you could barely hurt them. Sentinels usually relied heavily on teammates to do the killing, and its only real use was via a very specialized form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">Magikarp Power</a>, where even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> could be lifted and made helpless by the Sentinel's mix of both kinds of skills. By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>, however, the Sentinel has become a true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a>, when tech and biotic powers in general gained much larger damage output and the Sentinel's weapon skills became far more practical. It helped that they also got Tech Armor, making them the most durable class.
</li><li> Jacob is another case as far as offense goes. He has both Pull and Incendiary Ammo as offensive powers, rather than only one of each like, respectively, Jack and Grunt, but in addition to them not being incredibly useful later on, Jack and Grunt are better in direct combat. He gets Lift Grenades in <em>Citadel</em>, but again doesn't bring anything else special, as another teammate (Wrex this time) has the same power and also happens to be better in combat than Jacob. It's only with his Loyalty Power, Barrier, that the tables turn in his favor, as Barrier activates faster and with more upgrades than other shield powers like Fortification or Geth Shield Boost, turning Jacob from someone you only use when you have to into the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a>. And even then, he <em>still</em> comes in as inferior to Grunt, thanks to the latter's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> and huge hitpoint pool.
</li><li> Thane Krios is probably the worst case, as gameplay-wise he brings <em>nothing</em> exceptional to the table. He's a sniper, but Garrus and DLC character Zaeed will already have that covered and are more durable to boot, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Legion</span> comes later in the game yet can use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">Widow Sniper Rifle</a>. Biotically, Miranda and Samara will also have Warp or Throw already, in addition to being more versatile and/or effective to the point that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thane is one of the "bad" choices for the biotic bubble during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideMission">Suicide Mission</a></span>. His Loyalty Power, Shredder Ammo, provides a damage boost against organic targets, <em>but</em> is useless against protected targets, which is <em>everything</em> on higher difficulty settings, and in any case the player's better off using <em>any</em> other ammo type except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson">Cryo.</a> Since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">there's literally no specialist use for him during the final mission, not even as a backup option,</span> he's basically just a warm body to fill out the roster.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>, it's best to focus all of a character's ability points in their specialization tree and <em>one</em> ability tree, with maybe a few extra points in another tree when the first two are maxed out. Trying to spread the points equally across three or more trees can easily lead to Master Of None syndrome since you won't have enough points in any one tree to unlock the secondary bonuses, which can be a real problem at the endgame or on higher difficulties. Many of the available moves are decidedly mediocre without those bonuses.
<ul><li> That goes for weapon and magic skill trees. On the other hand, Rogues get a lot more value mixing-and-matching skills across trees than from most of the top ranked skills in each tree. They can still be effective as a Master Of None.

There are two schools of play in the game, "Board 'em quick" and "Pound them until they yield", which means that players will, depending on style, get a ship that is either extremely quick and maneuverable or has a huge broadside. This leaves the Brig Of War, which is slightly above average in speed, manouvering and weight of broadside, tragically unloved.
<ul><li> The tragedy is compounded by several of the rare Brig of War's basic stats, such as cargo space, cannon count, and crew size being matched by the extremely common Frigate, with only a few small differences in speed and agility to differentiate the two. Similarly, this is why traders rarely take Barques out into the water; they're a little faster and a little more agile than some of their peers, but their weight of cannon is so average and their cargo capacity is so light by contrast that merchant players usually pick up something either ultralight for smuggling runs (such as the Pinnace) or something massive and decently armed for bulk shipments (such as the Merchantman). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy">And no one likes Fluyts</a>.

Since guns have the largest variety of any weapon type in the game, a dedicated gunman can always find better options.

In theory, it's easily to see it as a major successor to the Zeon Zaku, despite it being used by the Earth Federation and the Titans. However, its power supply is lacking, meaning it can use a beam rifle <strong>or</strong> a beam saber, but not both at the same time (its back-up weapons include a standard machine gun and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlade">heat hawk</a>).

Not many details are given but there is a point-buy system attached to the levelling up mechanic, allowing you to upgrade a Duel Avatar's existing abilities or unlock new ones as you level up. In the early game spreading points around to unlock new abilities can help cover obvious weaknesses but at turns you into this trope at the higher levels. This is noted to be a problem for Cyan Pile, who, despite being a close combat blue type, has a pile-driver that serves more as a ranged weapon, and he claims that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalityPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalityPowers">this is because his feelings toward his long-time friends Haru and Chiyu are full of "contradictions," with a part of him wanting to keep them together and another part wanting to destroy their circle of friends</a>.

However, aside for a few high-powered custom models, it's outperformed by specialist designs in every single job - the Aries may have less firepower and armor, but is a better flier (in fact, the flying Leo only appears in the first episode, flown by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharClone">Char Clone</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Zechs</a> before switching to the Aries and then the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Tallgeese</a>); the Tragos is a more stable <em>and</em> mobile artillery platform with more powerful and longer-ranged cannons; the Taurus is a better space-based mobile suit; and the Maganac is a superior fighter in extreme environments like the desert. This is actually aknowledged in-universe, as the specialist designs were developed precisely to take over those roles (the development and first deployment of the Taurus actually happens during the series, and provides the plot of an early episode).

Except it sucks at <em>all</em> of them. It cannot carry a full-sized standard squad because some planned space for the men was filled with ammo, it cannot fight because the armour was shed to save weight for all the equipment it carries (not helping is the geniuses involved in the design requested it also be <em>amphibious</em>), so "real" armoured fighting vehicles will chew it up and spit it out. And it cannot scout because it's twelve feet tall and it has a turret with an enormous cannon and a missile launcher on it which means that any enemy that sees it is going to immediately mistake it for a tank and unload everything they have on it — it <em>makes itself a target by being there</em>.

Both the book and movie exaggerated the flaws of the Bradley (and were based on early prototypes as well), which has since proven to be an effective combat platform. With that said, the Bradley did incorporate too many features for its own good. In particular, the Bradley's amphibious capability and firing ports never really panned out: substantial preparation was required to prepare the vehicle for operation on water, while the firing ports could not be used with regular weapons and also compromised the vehicle's protection as well. Both of these features have since been largely dropped in favour of improved armour.

</li><li> The US Army's Universal Camouflage Pattern. It was designed to provide equal concealment in jungle, urban and desert terrain. It succeeded in <a class="urllink" href="http://defensetech.org/2007/07/06/when-you-dont-want-to-take-out-the-trash/">being equally sucky in all terrains<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The Army tried to own up by claiming that their testing trials were biased toward conditions in Iraq... only, the best performer in both desert and urban terrain was the trials' actual winner, Desert All-Over Brush.
<ul><li> A lot of people seem to believe Multicam is a universal camouflage pattern. There's just one problem: it is essentially an arid/urban camouflage pattern that is thoroughly outclassed by more specialized patterns outside of its intended zone.
</li><li> The US Navy Working Uniform has received a lot of criticism for a number of reasons, starting with the fact that it has a blue and gray camouflage pattern, in a profession <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">where falling into the ocean is an occupational hazard</a>. The uniform, designed for durability and presentability, can become too hot to wear for crew members working in the engine room or serving in tropical climates. It also has a tendency to cling to the body, which is something you do not want when you're exposed to fire or immersed in water.
</li></ul></li><li> Possibly the ultimate example of this in warfare is the British implementation of the battlecruiser. Ideally, it was supposed to be faster than the more powerful ships, and more powerful than the faster ships, but the problem was that they often had way too much firepower and were way too big and expensive to justify only using against light/unarmored ships, all the while lacking sufficient armour to be employed in pitched battle against other capital ships. Even more so, the constant advancement of technology during the war meant that battleships, armor and all, rapidly caught up in speed.
</li><li> Though a pretty impressive design that'd go on to inspire much better weapons, the FG-42 rifle proved to be a disappointment for the German army during WWII. The automatic rifle was meant to function as both a machine gun and rifle while still being light enough for paratroopers. However, it was too light to keep steady when firing fully automatic (half the weight of a BAR), too awkward to aim at distant targets (it was much shorter than a rifle) and had too small a magazine for use as a machine gun. Even worse, it was introduced when Germany's war economy was in shambles, meaning that the actual combat weapon was of poor construction and would literally beat itself apart under fully automatic fire.
</li><li> The M14 rifle was meant to be a universal replacement for the US Military's BAR squad automatic rifle, M1 Garand infantry rifle, and M3 submachine gun. On paper, it sounded like a good idea since it was based on the reliable M1 Garand rifle and would offer much needed versatility by letting soldiers switch between precise semi-auto and suppressive full-auto fire. In practice however, it was too light to be a squad automatic weapon, too heavy to be comparable to a submachine gun, and the recoil made fully automatic fire uncontrollable. The M14 was later replaced by the M16 as standard issue rifle, the M60 and then M249 for suppressive fire, and shorter-barreled M16 variants for short-range combat, and the M14 itself later found a new role as a specialized marksman rifle.
<ul><li> The US Army tried to consolidate weapons again with the "Objective Individual Combat Weapon program." While the original intent was just to replace the M16, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalPosts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalPosts">goal shifted to</a> make a weapon that would replace the M16, the M4, and personal grenade launchers. One of the results was H&amp;K's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWeaponsWillBeBoxyInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWeaponsWillBeBoxyInTheFuture">XM29</a>, a sci-fi looking weapon that had two separate barrels and two magazines for bullets and 20 mm grenades. The grenades could be programmed by the shooter to blow up at specific ranges for maximum effect. However, all the prototypes were extremely complicated (the special scope used to find range for the grenades alone had three nobs and a button on it), the grenades were both small (and filled with computer chips) so were noticeably more expensive while not being as effective as simple 40mm dumb grenades, and the whole weapon was too heavy and too short-ranged to act as a rifle.
</li></ul></li><li> The Mosin Nagant rifle, at least compared to other bolt action rifles in both the world wars. It is not easy to haul around, comfortable to shoot, accurate (without modification), or fast firing. And despite what some Russophiles might claim, it is also not easy to manufacture nor a particularly reliable weapon. It's actually rather complex for a bolt action and surprisingly temperamental, <em>especially</em> in the cold environments it was designed to work in.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2f8i6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2f8i6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2f8i6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The rimmed cartridges can jam the rifle if they're misaligned during loading and the bolt can freeze closed in extreme conditions.</span> The only saving grace of the rifle is it was a flexible enough platform that everything but the sluggish manufacturing time could be fixed relatively easily and that Russia/the Soviet Union didn't need to buy machines to produce it. Large stocks of old Tsarist-era rifles also granted another benefit during WWII - since the Soviet arsenal was filled with weapons that all used some variety of 7.62mm rounds, old Mosin Nagant barrels could be repurposed for newer weapons by simply chopping them into two or three smaller barrels for submachine guns.
</li><li> The <em>Kiev</em> and <em>Kuznetsov</em> class aircraft carriers have been discontinued largely because of their inability to function as either aircraft carriers or missile cruisers. Created during the Cold War partly to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">abuse a loophole</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3tybp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3tybp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3tybp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Under the Montreux Convention, a pure aircraft carrier cannot cross the Bosphorus. However, a cruiser that <em>just so happens</em> to carry aircraft, as the <em>Kiev</em> and <em>Kuznetsov</em> are classified, is perfectly fine.</span>, they carry both long-ranged anti-ship missiles and aircraft. In theory, this arrangement would make them more economical and survivable, as conventional carriers lack the ability to defend themselves besides launching planes. However, this arrangement actually made the ships <em>more</em> vulnerable and <em>less</em> cost-effective. The anti-ship missiles used up space that could've been used for storing munitions, fuel, and aircraft, limiting the versatility and effectiveness of the ship's air wing; conversely, the size requirements of carrying aircraft make them a far larger target than comparably-armed warships, in addition to imposing higher manpower requirements. As a result, the ships have neither the versatility and offensive capability of a true carrier, nor the survivability and efficiency of a missile cruiser. Subsequently, all <em>Kiev</em> ships no longer serve in that capacity while the <em>Kuznetsov</em> ships have been retooled into dedicated carriers.
<ul><li> <em>Kiev</em> and <em>Minsk</em> continued to be a master of none into their retirement. China really couldn't decide if they were training ships, event spaces, attractions, or museums. The constant booking issues and military requirements made them not particularly good at any function. In 2010 the issue was solved when China finally got its training carrier up and running and <em>Kiev</em> became a luxury hotel and <em>Minsk</em> became the center piece of a military themed amusement park.
</li></ul></li><li> Cargo liners suffered during the first half of the twentieth century due to trying to be too many different types of ships at once. In those days it was common for ocean liners to use extra space in their cargo hold <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4b3lk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4b3lk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4b3lk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which were used to store provisions and passenger luggage</span> to haul cargo and cargo ships often carried a small amount passengers. Making a ship that could carry large amounts of both passengers and cargo looked like a fantastic idea on paper. The biggest appeal of the concept was that the passengers only had to ride in the most comfortable and stable part of the ships, the middle and stern. In practice though these vessels couldn't challenge other passenger vessels. They couldn't compete with the first class grandeur of large ocean liners and, due to the addition of cargo facilities, had vastly reduced 2nd and especially 3rd class facilities. To take this trope to even greater extremes, Cargo liners tried to especially market to pleasure cruise enthusiasts but were even less suited for the purpose than ocean liners because they were forced to keep to strict cargo schedules. The only successful ones were dedicated to servicing remote ports where service regular service from full sized cargo ships and liners was deemed impracticable.

The tension between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a> fighters like Fedor Emelianenko and Georges St. Pierre and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMax">specialists</a> in one or two areas like Anderson Silva and Junior Dos Santos is an ongoing spectacle in MMA.
<ul><li> Between two specialists — such as the classic striker vs. grappler match up — there's a clear aspect where each fighter is (nominally) superior, but a Master of None risks having no such advantage, at the tradeoff of being at less of a disadvantage.
</li><li> This was a common problem in the early PRIDE era for Japanese fighters, where many came from the Japanese "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot">shoot-wrestling</a>"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5qb3i');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5qb3i" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5qb3i');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A more realistic style of pro wrestling which emphasized full contact moves and the matches looked like actual MMA bouts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">before MMA was a thing</a>, although it was still a "work" (i.e scripted)</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling">Professional Wrestling</a> circuit, which actually trained multiple disciplines (and were pioneers at that) such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuayThai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuayThai">Muay Thai</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatchWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatchWrestling">Catch Wrestling</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Judo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Judo">Judo</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Karate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Karate">Karate</a>. However, they were not proficient in any of them and thus they could not make a difference against their opponents. The trend only changed with fighters such as Daijiro Matsui and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KazushiSakuraba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KazushiSakuraba">Kazushi Sakuraba</a> who focused in wrestling and anti-game tactics.
</li></ul></li><li> A badly-made spork can seem like this. Can't hold as much food nor hold it as well as a spoon can, nor can it poke and hold as much solid food as a fork can. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloneHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloneHigh">knork</a> is even worse.
</li><li> From an economic standpoint, anything or anyone that is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a> is punted into this category by default. The concept of "specialization" is far more endorsed, since producing a great many products at medium efficiency with decent cost loses out in the face of being able to produce a single product very efficiently, and at less cost.
<ul><li> An example: The two basic strategies a company can follow are those of <em>cost leader</em> and <em>differentiator</em>. Being a cost leader is all about efficiency and minimising costs; you're essentially doing the same as the competition, but you're doing it cheaper so you can undercut their prices. Differentiators focus on "doing things differently" or offering something the competition doesn't, which lets you get away with having higher prices. Companies that pursue neither strategy end up "between the chairs" - their products are neither particularly good nor particularly cheap, so why would you buy them? Same principle applies to going after <em>broad</em> vs. <em>niche</em> markets.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6ky48');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6ky48" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6ky48');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Note that <em>broad differentiators</em> - "which have pursued their differentiation strategy in a way that has allowed them to lower their cost structure at the same time" - may exist, at least in theory, but they're rare exceptions and they <em>will</em> fall into this trope if they ever lose their edge. High risk, high reward.</span>
</li><li> For this reason, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll">polymaths</a>, aka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenaissanceMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenaissanceMen">Renaissance Men</a>, are being viewed as increasingly pointless in academia - a polymath cannot effectively contribute to any single area of study nearly as well as a specialist in that area. At best, the polymath will go unnoticed. At worst, they may be kicked out or be posed as detrimental due to their insufficient knowledge in any given field.
</li></ul></li><li> The best cricket 'all-rounders' are greats who could get into the team as both bowler and batsmen. All too often one day teams are packed full of people who can guess which end of a bat to hold more than half the time and jog in to bowl without tripping over their shoe laces too often.
</li><li> Encyclopedias can offer info on a wide variety of topics but even online user-contributed ones like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> only have enough depth to be a good intro for any one area. There's still no generalist substitute for textbooks and training.
</li><li> The F-35 is widely considered this: in trying to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a> while still trying to be a stealth super-plane, it quickly became apparent that it was an overly costly and ultimately redundant design. It should be noted that this aircraft is forced to be three different aircraft in one - the Air Force wants a conventional multi-role fighter, the Navy wants a carrier-based fighter with longer range, and the Marines want a VTOL aircraft to replace the AV-8B Harrier - which is especially damning given that A) every other successful multirole warplane was not deliberately designed as such (every design that tried ended up being single-role), and B) every successful <em>stealth</em> warplane was single-role (and almost none of them were fighters). The project's goal of "commonality" between all three services has essentially meant that every service was forced to accept compromises: a feature designed to satisfy one service requirement would have been completely unnecessary for the other two services. As such, the USAF and Marines ended up with a far heavier fighter than they required, and the Navy had to accept a plane without redundant engines. Furthermore, the desire to fulfill so many roles with one aircraft has meant that many systems have yet to be mature, despite a protracted development period. Compounding this situation is that the F-35 is simply outshone to a large degree by almost every specialist aircraft in service. It lacks the loitering capability of a close air support platform like the A-10, it is too lightly armed in some configurations to function as an air-superiority fighter or fighter bomber like the F-16 and F/A-18, and it is too expensive to use as a dedicated interceptor.
</li><li> The Mi-24 "Hind" is an interesting case. Although it is highly effective when functioning as an attack helicopter, it suffers in performance when using its troop carrying capability. Carrying infantry means having a large amount of extra weight, limiting its combat capabilities, while its carrying capacity of only eight soldiers is on the low end of transport helicopters. It isn't too surprising that its successor, the Mi-28 "Havoc", drops the troop transport ability entirely in favor of a streamlined attack helicopter design.
</li><li> This is one proposed reason as to why there are no bears in Africa, specifically south of the Sahara. It isn't because of climate (there are bears in India, for instance) - rather, the native carnivores (lions, hyenas, leopards, etc.) are better at hunting and the native herbivores (elephants, giraffes, wildebeasts, etc.) are better at eating plants. Bears are omnivorous, but they are crowded out by competition in either category. The only known species of bear that ever lived in Africa was the Atlas bear that lived in the Atlas Mountains in Morocco and Algeria (notably, it is on the other side of the Sahara from all those super-carnivores and super-herbivores) - the last known member was hunted to extinction in the 1870's. However, this hypothesis is considered controversial given that bears lived alongside lions, hyenas, buffalo, and elephants in Europe, Asia, and the Americas for millions of years.
</li><li> This is also proposed to be a reason for the extinction of the bear-dog, a large generalist hunter and early carnivore. Bear-dogs were powerful predators, able to scavenge, ambush, and handle diverse prey. Around the Pliocene, though, big cats made for better ambush hunters, "bone-crusher" dogs performed well as opportunistic scavengers, and bears were superior omnivores.
</li><li> In sports, the term for this is "tweener", especially when talking about up-and-coming prospects. Some players aren't quite big enough to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">The Big Guy</a> and not quite fast enough to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a>, which makes them less effective at positions where one is valued over the other. Such players tend to become backups since they are beaten out for the starting job by specialists (more likely if there are roster cap considerations for the manager to take into account).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">Association Football</a>: Some footballers became known for being "Utility Players"; versatile enough to play multiple positions, but not skilled enough at a particular position to become a regular starter. The most famous example happens to be Manchester United fan-favorite John O'Shea: while he was merely a decent squad player in Sir Alex Ferguson's legendary United teams, his versatility and diverse skill set allowed him to play center back, right back, left back, defensive midfielder, and <strong>GOALKEEPER!</strong> (No, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79NLmSokD2I">we are not kidding<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>). Nowadays, the most well-known utility players include Man United's Daley Blind and Liverpool's James Milner.
</li><li> During the 1960's, multi-purpose stadiums that could accommodate both baseball and American football teams became all the rage for civic infrastructure projects. The idea seemed sound enough - why build two separate stadiums and rack up twice as much infrastructure and construction cost, especially as with the concurrent rise of American suburbia cars became the dominant form of transportation and parking lots would be needed? As it turned out, the differing infrastructure requirements for each sport (field dimensions, equipment, possibility of both teams' seasons overlapping in August-October, among others) meant the stadiums ended up doing a bad job of satisfying their requirements for both sports' teams and their fans. Starting in the late 1980's sport-specific stadiums came back into vogue; the first of the "retro-classic" ballparks for the major leagues was built in 1992 (Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore) to rave reviews. Nowadays, separate facilities are maintained for cities that host teams in multiple sports, though they'll frequently be located near each other so that they can still share things like parking facilities and nearby restaurants and bars; as of 2019, only one stadium from this era remains that a baseball and football team still both call home (O.co Coliseum in Oakland, home of baseball's Athletics and football's Raiders until 2020 when the Raiders leave for Las Vegas). That's not to say that nowadays stadiums couldn't be converted to host sporting events other than what they're designed for (e.g., the college football Pinstripe Bowl is held yearly in Yankee Stadium), but they're saved for special occasions for the most part.
</li><li> Combining track and field tracks within soccer stadiums fell into the same trap. Originally track and field (and in some cases bike racing) was enjoying similar popularity as soccer and adding a patch of dirt ash or grass in the middle of a track and field track was seen as efficient use of space and resources. However, with the rise of soccer as the all dominant sport bar none, tracks were increasingly seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">The Scrappy</a> and no new stadium has been built with them since about the 1980s. Part of the reason is that they increase the distance between field and spectators and in big stadiums the upper rungs are already pretty far away from the field. The only way to fix <em>that</em> would be a steeper incline in the rungs, which in temperate latitudes means the grass won't get enough sunlight most of the year. Some stadiums opted to make the grass movable for that reason, and they park the field outside the stadium whenever possible.
</li><li> The spadroon was a type of cut-and-thrust sword popular in the late 18th century. Designed to be light enough to match a smallsword in an exchange of thrusts, but heavy enough to do some cutting, it ended up too light to cut well, but too flexible to be useful on the thrust, and the design quietly fell out of fashion. Modern re-enactors often state (not entirely jokingly) that the only combat use for a spadroon is to point out which way your subordinates should be heading.
</li><li> Most real-life attempts at making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixandMatchWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixandMatchWeapon">hybrid weapons</a> often combined the weaknesses of both weapons while reducing their strengths. For example, swords with guns in them had poor balance due to the additional weight added by the gun, while the sword's grip made aiming the gun at anything outside of point-blank range extremely difficult (at such ranges you could also probably stab them with the sword instead). Limited space to cram the functions of both weapon types into one device also often meant that the blade was brittle and poorly secured into the grip, while the gun was underpowered, inaccurate, and often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustShotMarvinInTheFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustShotMarvinInTheFace">incredibly unsafe</a>.
</li><li> Microconsoles have historically struggled with this. In theory, they're a low-cost alternative to home videogame consoles that mostly run smartphone games. In practice, they end up combining the home console's lack of portability and inconvenience with the smartphone's weak hardware and shallow games, and the low cost doesn't really enter into it because chances are, you can already play any relevant games on something else you own. It's not for no reason that the majority of microconsoles have either flopped (the PS TV and Ouya) or are closer to being streaming boxes that simply happen to also be capable of running games (the Amazon Fire TV).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmphibiousAutomobile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmphibiousAutomobile">Amphibious Automobiles</a> in real life have suffered from this frequently (bar the ones meant for army use, which obviously have much more practical need for it). The most infamous one was the Amphicar 770, the only one to have any amount of success in the civilian market. Not only was it prohibitively expensive and requiring frequent maintenance, but it was slow and ungainly in both water and on land - the name "770" came from its respective top speeds of seven knots and seventy miles per hour. Needless to say, anyone who could afford one could just buy both a car and a boat. Hell if they aren't cool, though.
</li><li> While fans of SUVs consider the cars <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a> equally at home in the wilds and in urban environments, detractors often opine that the vehicle type is too domesticated for actual off-road duty while simultaneously being too big, too heavy and too fuel-hungry to make for a decent city car.
</li><li> The Antonov A-40, a Soviet prototype for a flying tank. As its designers discovered, the only way to get it airborne was to use the already lightly-armored and outdated T-60 and remove most of its ammunition, armament, and fuel, but it was still so heavy that it needed a massive custom-made glider structure and a modified bomber to (barely) tow it. It was too slow and impractical to be useful as a fast-attack vehicle, and too weak after being lightened to fulfill a tank's purpose.
</li><li> Modern ultrazoom cameras, that give you in a single package everything from a wideangle lens to a powerful telephoto. In order to have something portable and not ludicrously expensive, this comes at the cost of having to use a smaller sensor than other cameras, which means more noise as you ramp up the ISO and poorer image quality than prime lenses or more conventional zooms, despite said zooms being a marvel of optical engineering.
</li><li> The possibility of underwater combat during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> saw the development of weapons firing thin and long darts that would be more effective traveling through water than regular bullets (a pistol's range, if it can even fire in the first place, would be five centimeters underwater). Both pistols and rifles were designed for this purpose, at least on the Soviet side, but the rifles quickly fell by the wayside - when used underwater, rifles like the APS were noticeably larger and bulkier than pistols like the SPP-1, with wide and flat magazines that gave a lot of surface area for water resistance to affect how quickly they could shift their aim, and with an effective range that was barely an improvement over the pistol. The APS could be used above-water like a regular assault rifle, too, but it suffered there as well, as its range was still pathetically poor (only 50 meters, the same as a regular pistol), and the barrel was only rated to last through two-hundred shots above water. Spetsnaz frogmen, when going on missions that required swimming to a target point, would frequently use the SPP-1 pistol just in case they needed to shoot people underwater, and then switch to a regular rifle once they were on dry land rather than try to use the APS.
</li><li> Laptops with touchscreens. The touchscreen adds additional weight and drains too much power from the laptop. The touchscreen itself is attached to a laptop, reducing its portability and being saddled with software not specced to a touchscreen.
