</div></div><p>In a Fawlty Towers Plot, one of the characters tells an initial lie, then other lies must be told in order to sustain the original lie, until the entire construct of falsehoods becomes too ridiculous and convoluted to hold together, and comes crashing down upon its creators in the most destructive, humiliating, and sometimes hilarious way imaginable.

<ul><li> The entire plot of the anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Utakata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Utakata">Utakata</a></em> is based on a Fawlty Towers Plot. However, instead of going for comedy, the life of lies that the main character is forced to lead causes her to hate herself more and more as the series goes on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina">Love Hina</a></em>, episode 25: To avoid having to take up the leadership of her martial arts style before she thinks she's ready, Motoko forces Keitaro to masquerade as her boyfriend. In her school, falling in love renders her ineligible to take up the leadership, as it had her elder sister, who gave it up to marry. It backfires when her examiner, her elder sister, uncovers the plot, and forces Motoko to either win a duel against her, or actually marry Keitaro!
<ul><li> Motoko does not learn her lesson, for late in the manga when she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ronin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ronin">fails her university admission tests</a> she does it <em>again</em>... to the same sister... with similar results.
</li><li> Not to mention the basic plot of Love Hina is based on this trope - namely, that Keitaro is a Toudai student, when in reality he's a dropout trying desperately to make it there to meet the girl he made a childhood promise to to get in there with that he hasn't seen in over 15 years. This lie is unraveled before the second manga volume, but it's still basically what gets the story going.
</li><li> One should keep in mind though that it was the girls, particularly Kitsune, that pushed this on him before he had a chance to explain himself when he first arrived. All he did was mention "Tokyo U" and they generally assumed he was a student from there.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WelcomeToTheNHK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WelcomeToTheNHK">Welcome to the N.H.K.</a></em>'s protagonist does this, frequently. Despite that fact that clearly nobody believes him, he tries to go with it anyway.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JunjouRomantica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JunjouRomantica">Junjou Romantica</a></em> manga, Takahiro convinces Misaki to obey him by telling him he's a tanuki who will have to leave if Misaki makes him too sad. As Misaki becomes more and more skeptical, Takahiro creates bigger and bolder lies, until...
<div class="indent"><strong>Takahiro:</strong> What do I do, Usagi?! Even after I told him I was a bear-morphing Martian bestowed with the military order to save humanity, and for that had to leave behind his precious family and friends, when a distortion in the time-space continuum led to a time rip back to the age of civil war where aliens were hiding, and in order to defeat them, had to take up alliance with a panda-morphing Saturnian...!! Now...now, he won't believe me again! Why?!!
</div></li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>, Ash's friend Angie is left by her parents to care for a Lickitung at their daycare centre, but she over-trains it and it evolves into a huge Lickilicky. Worried the owner will be upset, she hides it in the woods. It escapes, starting rumors throughout the town of a monster running loose and attracting media attention (as well as Team Rocket posing as reporters). She and the heroes must then recover the pokemon without anyone finding out. In the end, the lie is exposed, but Lickilicky's trainer is overjoyed that it evolved.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/ThirtySixQuestions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/ThirtySixQuestions">36 Questions</a></em>, Judith only intended that have a fake identity for the span of "one cup of coffee"... only to end up continuing as it was "Too late to backpedal, too good not to keep going." The lie came crashing down after two years, when her parents sent private investigators to track her down.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bambi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bambi">Bambi</a></em> fanfic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/CreamedCherries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/CreamedCherries">Creamed Cherries</a></em> uses this, and understandably so since the story is meant to be a parody of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">Simpsons</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS7E2122ShortFilmsAboutSpringfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS7E2122ShortFilmsAboutSpringfield">"Steamed Hams" skit.</a> In it, Bambi has a lunch date with Faline and planned to serve berries he worked hard to get for her, but an accident that ruins them, forces Thumper to create a fib for him and forces Bambi to improvise by replacing the berries with apples and calling them "Creamed Cherries", while continuously lying to Faline the whole time as she (seemingly) starts catching on to Bambi's ruse.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY">RWBY</a></em> fanfic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ProfessorArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ProfessorArc">Professor Arc</a></em> is one of these.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirdcage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirdcage">The Birdcage</a></em> starts off with a small lie about a woman's soon-to-be in-laws to get the ball rolling. A pair of gay nightclub owners now have to hide their identities from an ultra-conservative US senator who's looking to make sure her in-laws are a "wholesome" family after a controversy involving the senator's colleague dying in bed with a prostitute. You had better believe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LaCageAuxFolles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LaCageAuxFolles">La Cage aux folles</a></em>, being the film <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirdcage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirdcage">The Birdcage</a> is based off, features this as well in the same manner.
</li></ul></li><li> The film <em>Tallulah</em> involves Ellen Page stealing a baby and passing it off as her own to get her ex-boyfriend's mom to take her in. It's a ridiculous plan you know is going to come crashing down sooner or later
</li><li> This is the basis of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoodByeLenin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoodByeLenin">Good Bye, Lenin!</a></em>, where a woman in East Berlin misses the fall of the Wall while in a temporary coma, and her family try to keep the news from her for fear the shock would kill her. They go as far as making fake news segments and digging through garbage for communist goods. It ends with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an aversion, as she finds out but doesn't say anything, letting them continue the charade.</span>
</li><li> Another German film, <em>Wahrheit oder Pflicht</em> (as in "truth or dare"), has a girl who fails school but pretends to still attend. Things go downhill from there.
</li><li> The French film <em>Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis</em> involves a man being forced to work <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OopNorth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OopNorth">Oop North</a> (aka. le Nord, which is literally French for "the North", official name of a northern region of France and whose inhabitants are locally called "the Ch'tis") while his wife and kid live in the south of France. Le Nord is considered as a rather unloving place, but when he gets up there he finds that all of the stories are false and rather enjoys the place. When he visits home at the weekend, he enjoys the sympathy he gets from his wife and doesn't tell her that it's rather nice and exaggerates all the stories for more sympathy. Of course, she eventually decides that she needs to visit his work and he needs to drag his insulted friends into pretending to live up to the stories he told.
</li><li> The plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Fargo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Fargo">Fargo</a></em> involves Jerry Lundegaard starting this kind of plot by conning the GMAC out of $325,000 by forging the VIN numbers of cars that do not exist in his inventory. We never find out why he needed that money or how he lost it. But now he's desperate enough to hire two crooks to kidnap his wife and con a million dollars of "ransom money" out of his cruelly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObnoxiousInLaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObnoxiousInLaws">Obnoxious In-Laws</a> for the sake of keeping the obnoxiously persistent GMAC loan inspector off his back. The result is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a>, because the result of <em>this</em> Faulty Towers Plot is about a dozen deaths, all of them a product of the crooks' violently poor impulse control, and Lundegaard ends up in jail.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JustGoWithIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JustGoWithIt">Just Go with It</a></em> is about a plastic surgeon's assistant pretending to be his soon-to-be-ex-wife in order to avoid coming clean about his womanizing, which spirals out of control, eventually involving her children, his cousin, her old college rival, and a semi-impromptu Hawaiian vacation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SexDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SexDrive">Sex Drive</a></em> is basically made of this trope, with more than half the characters spending more than half the movie lying, and frantically stacking lies on top of lies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EasyA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EasyA">Easy A</a></em> is also based heavily on this trope, with the entire film revolving around Olive attempting to keep her lies concealed, which eventually builds to ridiculous consequences.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeetTheParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeetTheParents">Meet the Parents</a></em> rests on Greg trying so hard to impress his girlfriend's family that he ends up telling little lies that lead to more complicated problems when those lies have to be better explained and Greg just ends up digging himself a deeper hole. One particular instance had him claiming to have grown up on a farm and leads to him telling a story of how he once milked a cat.
</li><li> In <em>Situation Hopeless...But Not Serious</em> a lonely German shopkeeper tried to prevent the two American soldiers he was keeping captive in his bomb shelter from discovering that WWII had ended.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HailTheConqueringHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HailTheConqueringHero">Hail the Conquering Hero</a></em> is about how Woodrow, ashamed at the fact he was discharged from the Marines for hay fever, moved far away from his hometown, wrote letters to his mother that lied and said he was discharged for getting wounded in combat, and a letter to his girlfriend saying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy">it was over between them, so she would move on with someone else and be happy</a>. However, Woodrow meets a group of Marines in a bar one night after he buys them drinks and sandwiches, and when they hear his story, they convince him to go home, and once there, to his horror, he's treated like a real hero. Not only that, but the Marines lie for him to make him seem even more of a hero than *he* claimed to be, and his ex-girlfriend is still in love with him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Komaa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Komaa">Komaa</a></em>, Amir has the brilliant idea of trying to pass the low-class, uneducated, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotTalkToWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotTalkToWomen">shy</a> Hassan off as a wealthy doctor.

Jakob, a Jew trapped in a ghetto in Poland during World War II, is at SS headquarters when he hears a news report that the Russians are advancing. When his friend doesn't believe his story, he claims that he has a hidden radio and heard a news report. His friend believes this, which backfires, as the news of Jakob's illegal radio spreads all over the ghetto, and Jakob has to go to increasingly desperate measures to hide the truth as his friends and acquaintances pester him for news of the outside world.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarriorsApprentice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarriorsApprentice">The Warrior's Apprentice</a></em>, Miles Vorkosigan becomes Admiral Naismith through just such a chain of lies, inventing a mission in order to find a role for a Barayaran deserter, pretending to be a mercenary leader when he gets caught smuggling arms, building the pretence when he gets caught in a war... and then it all goes horribly un-funny when he realises that the end of his lies is that he's acquired a private army, which is the worst form of treason for a Barayaran Lord. Drama ensues.
</li><li> This is far from the <em>only</em> example, mind you. The stories often show Miles getting more and more perturbed as he wades deeper and deeper into the mire of lies he's making, even to the extent of nearly having a nervous breakdown in the story above. He generally relies on "forward momentum" (more lies) to get out of trouble. Amazingly, Miles is brilliant enough that he consistently makes this <em>work</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Until <em>Memory</em>, when it all falls apart on him, costing him his ImpSec career.</span>

Tearoom owner Sally Pyne was so caught up in the fantasy of her foreign vacation that she told a few tall tales about her manor house to an attentive suitor. She's aghast when the man writes announcing his intention to visit, and a scheme is hatched to allow her to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaintainTheLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaintainTheLie">play the role of Lady Bountiful in Willis Sr.'s house during his visit</a> while concealing her presence there from the other villagers (particularly a trio of single women who've set their caps for eligible widower Willis Sr.).

Her reputation is cemented after she participates in some major crimes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after a real supervillain blackmails her</span>.

When it wins the children's prize (a holiday for the child and his parents), he confirms that Rodney is fourteen. This necessitates other lies, such as not telling Rodney and Cassandra <em>why</em> it's a holiday for three until they've arrived, claiming he and Cassandra are Rodney's parents, and preventing Rodney and Cassandra from exposing his scheme by insisting to them both (separately) that the other is really enjoying the break.
<ul><li> And paid off brilliantly when, at the end of the episode, Del is in possession of a winning lottery ticket - but is forced to give up the money because the ticket is in Rodney's name, and local law states that 14-year-olds are not allowed to gamble. At this point they are <em>unable</em> to break the lie, because Del went to the trouble of forging all their travel documents.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyEndings">Happy Endings</a></em> had an episode whose plot centered around a harmless white lie told to the gang's annoying acquaintance, which in turn led to more and more lies of increasingly epic proportions. At one point, Brad and Jane somehow bought into their own lie and had a fight about how to raise the child they were fake-expecting, culminating in a strangely almost real split up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>, Mr. Schuester's wife Terri's fake pregnancy becomes one of these very fast. She even manages to gain the compliance of her OB/GYN. Her need to produce an actual baby leads her to Quinn, whose (actual) teenage pregnancy is something of a Fawlty Towers Plot itself. Eventually Mr. Schuester catches on, however, depriving the audience of seeing how she would manage faking labor and birth.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdventuresOfLanoAndWoodley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdventuresOfLanoAndWoodley">The Adventures of Lano and Woodley </a></em> episode "One Simple Task", Frank tells a series of ever-increasing lies to hide the fact he forgot to book a place at a caravan park, which ends with "I am an alien!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Coupling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Coupling">Coupling</a></em> does this a lot. Chief example: Patrick lies to his current girlfriend, who's bisexual, about how he has no interest in Sally, his old flame, because she's a lesbian (she is no such thing). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfContextEavesdropping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfContextEavesdropping">Cross talk ensues</a>.

<div class="indent"><strong>Jeff:</strong> I've got the key to the gates of paradise... but I've got <em>too many legs</em>!
</div></li></ul></li><li> Subverted in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em>, which hinges around a single, simple, fully successful white lie told by Leonard to Penny to get out of going to a play. Sheldon then assumes that the rest of the world thinks like him, and proceeds to create an overly intricate series of lies involving a fictional drug-addicted cousin (with backstory and a series of internet pages). All of this works perfectly, but he keeps piling on lies, until Leonard wakes up to find the fake cousin having breakfast in their apartment. To the very end, Penny doesn't suspect a thing.
<ul><li> Double points for Penny thinking she has averted Fawlty Towers complications by convincing Sheldon they should tell everyone the "truth" about why he and Leonard can't see her play. Also, the episode is called "The Loobenfeld Decay"; is that glorious, or what?
</li><li> Humorously reversed in a fourth season episode when Sheldon discovers that Leonard has had a periodic affair with Raj's sister Priya whenever she comes to town. When asked to keep it a secret, Sheldon proceeds to develop a new series of lies that are "un-unravelable" to explain what Leonard was doing the previous night, which involves spending time with an Irish barmaid (complete with a lock of reddish hair for evidence). Leonard dismissed it as unnecessary, but an offhand question by Howard on why he missed the new episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Caprica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Caprica">Caprica</a></em>, Leonard discovers he needs an alibi right then. After a halfhearted attempt at going with the barmaid excuse, he breaks down and tells them everything.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in the American version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">The Office</a></em>, in which Michael Scott's initial lies are always painfully obvious to everyone, but he nonetheless tries to support them with more lies and stall tactics, each more transparent and pathetic than the last. In one episode, Stanley admits to Michael he was having an affair. He instantly uses it as break room gossip, then tries to backpedal with ridiculous stories, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalTruth">including saying that Pam was pregnant, when neither Pam nor Jim had told anyone.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em> had a lot of these, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">hung a lampshade</a> on it by having Daphne suggest (during one between Frasier and Niles in "Rivals") that they just agree to sit the other down and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustEatGilligan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustEatGilligan">have one open, frank conversation</a>. Frasier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBlind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBlind">shoots her down</a>.
<ul><li> Subverted, however, in one episode where Daphne's ex-boyfriend re-enters her life, clearly itching to propose marriage to her despite their five-year separation. In desperation to let him down gently, Daphne claims that she's married to Niles. Over the course of the episode, Frasier's apartment becomes Daphne and Niles', Frasier becomes the husband of Roz, who becomes Maris and infertile, and Martin becomes an ex-astronaut. Incredibly, despite the complete implausibility of everything he's being told (thanks to Martin who - annoyed at being patronized - has delighted in making things much more complicated than they have to be), Daphne's ex-boyfriend believes <em>every single word he's told</em>, and eventually storms out not because he discovers the truth, but because he's become so convinced by their lies that he's convinced they're all horrible people. Leads to this classic line of dialogue:
<div class="indent"><strong>Daphne:</strong> Wait! You don't understand! We're not the horrible people you think we are! <br/><strong>Frasier:</strong> No! The truth is, <em>we've been lying to you all night</em>!
</div></li><li> They eventually lampshade their use of the trope in the 10th season episode "Daphne Does Dinner". The episodes starts at the crash of one of these plots, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">although we never get to see it</a>, it apparently involved Frasier having Tourette syndrome, flaming kebabs, a burning toupee, Martin as an Italian count, and a goat in the kitchen. Daphne claims that the constant party complications comes from the involvement of the title character (and his brother), and decides to to ban him from any involvement in the party she's planning. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When her party ends up just as badly, the Crane family takes it as a rite of passage to become a Crane.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Happens often in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWorstWeekOfMyLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWorstWeekOfMyLife">The Worst Week of My Life</a></em>. If Howard ever tells a lie — even if it's a small, little white one — things will rapidly get out of hand and collapse in on him at the worst possible moment. It's just one of the many ways in which the universe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy">is determined to make him suffer</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin">refusing to let him get away with</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin">anything</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LeadBalloon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LeadBalloon">Lead Balloon</a></em> uses this frequently, with Rick digging himself into deep holes in order to save time. One example is when he needs to fax a document to someone and realises not many businesses use fax machines now. He notices a fax machine in a real estate agents and goes in pretending to be interested in a property just so he can use the fax machine. Not wanting the estate agent to realise the real reason he was in there, he agrees to view a house the next day. During the viewing, the estate agent tells him she believes he's being legitimate, despite her boss warning her not to waste her time. In order not to break this image, Rick reluctantly agrees to buy the house and put a deposit on it. Magda (who was acting as his wife) is understandably incredibly confused by all this and tells him "In my country when someone says 'yes' and shakes hands, that means they will buy the house." He claims things are done differently in England. This is all made worse when it turns out the house owner was a client of Mel's who had recently fallen on hard times and was ecstatic that something had finally gone right in his life. It is never revealed how the truth came out.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonnyWithAChance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonnyWithAChance">Sonny with a Chance</a></em> has Sonny write a fan letter to herself when she thinks she doesn't have any fans writing for her. This forces her to disguise herself as her own fan, switching between both her two selves and even having to meet her own disguise in front of the world.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NotGoingOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NotGoingOut">Not Going Out</a></em> did this, with Lee and Tim having to make up more and more ridiculous lies, culminating in this (slightly paraphrased) quote:
<div class="indent"><strong>Lucy:</strong> What lesson have you learned? <br/><strong>Lee:</strong> To always be honest and truthful. Now, get out there and pretend I'm blind, Tim's disabled, Daisy has amnesia and you've got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTourettes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTourettes">Tourette's</a>.
</div><ul><li> Actually, this happens to Lee several times throughout the series. In one episode, he goes to extreme lengths to prevent Lucy from finding out that he accidentally told her father about a surprise party she was throwing for him and her mother. By the end of the episode, he's even confusing himself.
</li></ul></li><li> An <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EverybodyLovesRaymond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EverybodyLovesRaymond">Everybody Loves Raymond</a></em> episode features Ray and Debra lying that they didn't have dinner with Marie since they were making sure an important football game for Ray to write about was taped properly. Frank then asks to watch the tape, and things build from there until their washing machine is destroyed from Frank's attempts to fix it ("This one part won't go back") and Marie easily figures everything out.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em>, Hawkeye uses his imaginary childhood friend Tuttle to sign off on donations to an orphanage. Then people want to meet Tuttle for themselves, with Hawkeye trying to avoid it or convince them they already had. They avert the part where it all crashes down around their ears by having Tuttle "die" of a parachuting accident when he is to be presented with an award.
<ul><li> The best part of this episode is how everyone gradually claims to be good friends with Tuttle, in order not to feel left out.
</li><li> Or at the very end, where Trapper creates <em>another</em> imaginary person to take Tuttle's place: Major Murdoch.
</li><li> Or during the credits, where the lie went meta, and Tuttle was credited "As Himself."
</li><li> Similarly, Hawkeye and Charles, out of boredom, start a rumor that Marilyn Monroe is to visit the 4077th. This spins off into a separate web of lies as they try to bluff their way into being put into contact with her so they can get her to actually come. As with Tuttle, they make up an excuse for why she hasn't turned up and no one realizes what happened.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FraggleRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FraggleRock">Fraggle Rock</a></em> episode "Boober's Quiet Day", Boober lies in an attempt to get out of caring for a pet monster, and through a series of escalating lies, eventually winds up impersonating the Old Gypsy Lady.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BetterOffTed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BetterOffTed">Better Off Ted</a></em> when Ted tells a lie about the jabberwocky project and everyone is sucked into it by the corporate machinery. Ted wants to tell the truth. He is then reminded that if it turns out there is no jabberwocky project, they are all going to lose their jobs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">plays this for drama</a> in "Instant Karma," wherein <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><strike>Chase and Foreman try to hide that they let an African dictator die</strike> Chase killed an African dictator</span>.
</li><li> When Terri makes up various lies to avoid accepting an invitation to go out for dinner with her boss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThreesCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThreesCompany">Three's Company</a></em>, her boss suggests having dinner at her apartment instead. Jack subsequently has to act out the lie by pretending to have a broken ankle and be married to Terri and and Larry and Janet have to pretend to be a French-speaking couple who doesn't know any English.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSuiteLifeOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSuiteLifeOnDeck">The Suite Life on Deck</a></em> episode "The Defiant Ones", Cody misses a homework assignment due to having spent a romantic evening with Bailey the night before. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBGrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBGrade">Unable to bear the shame of receiving a single bad grade</a>, he fabricates the excuse that he was caring for Bailey, who'd injured her ankle. This leads to Bailey reluctantly faking an injury, and eventually the entire student body of Seven Seas Highs being drawn into a web of lies that is increasingly complex and ridiculous. It all comes crashing down the next day when Cody misses yet another assignment, having been too busy maintaining the farce.
<ul><li> Another episode features Zack lying to Maya about how he'll attend her poetry reading even though he intends to be at a video game night with Cody, Woody, and Moseby. His efforts to be in both places at once predictably fail, but Maya takes it pretty well, all things considered.

When questioned further, she reveals that she hides them at her sister's apartment, which is <em>like</em> a farm "in the air" and takes them for walks in the weekend. By the end of the episode she's trying to get in touch with a petting zoo in order to hire out a pig so she can take pictures of it with herself in a balaclava to prove her claims.

It was used on Carla when Turk and most of the male hospital staff were viewing a candid video of Turk and Carla's hot babysitter... and worked <em>flawlessly</em> - until Turk accidentally sits on the remote afterwards and the tape starts playing again. Carla figures out that whole collective performance was a lie, and grills him for it.

</li><li> Ben Jonson, a contemporary of Shakespeare, also knew the trick:
<ul><li> He drew up a magnificent Fawlty Towers Plot in <em>Volpone</em>, which is about a man who pretends to be dying so he can swindle people, who think that giving him gifts will make them his heirs.
</li><li> Jonson's slightly less famous <em>The Alchemist</em> is an even better example: three con artists have half a dozen customers all expecting different magic/alchemy jobs to be done for them, each of them by a different persona of all three grifters; the customers start dropping by the house at the same time, creating collisions between multiple Fawlty Towers Plots with people being stuffed into closets — and then when somebody else hears them yelling, they're told it's the moaning of the spirits.

The two female protagonists both think they are dating the same man named Ernest, and initially react badly when the truth is revealed. The play subverts the trope in that the lie told by Jack <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalTruth">is not actually a lie</a>; his given name was Ernest, but having been lost as a baby by his nanny, he did not know it. The revelations take place one after the other, flipping the plot around as much as the initial lies. On realising that he was an orphan, Jack's fiance's guardian would refuse to allow them to marry... if not for the fact that she has just now realised that Jack was the child lost from her sister years ago, making her much happier about Jack marrying his fiance (despite them being legally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins">cousins</a> now).

A year later, he is rescued by the Marines... including Daffy, who joined the Corps after failing to find a place to live. And since he was in the Albanian prison for a year, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">he's freed just in time for the next peach festival.</a></span>

An alien, Fib, tells Junior that he should lie to his dad, and he does by telling him that it was his friend, Laura who did it (in a very ridiculous way). Laura, who was there when Junior actually knocked over the plate, eventually learns of this, and tells others that Junior is lying, so then Junior (with the help of Fib) begins telling people that it was Laura's brother, Lenny, who did it (again, in a very ridiculous way). Eventually Laura, Lenny and other kids start yelling at Junior for lying. Junior, lying to try to keep him out of trouble, is then kidnapped by Fib, who has been feeding off of Junior's lies and is now a Giant. Only when Junior is forced to admit he did everything does he weaken Fib and get himself (and Larry Boy, who failed trying to save him) free.

When Adora and Glimmer show up unexpectedly while he's visiting home, he has to hurriedly brief them on his lie, which escalates until Adora has five different majors and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentUponTheWrongSyllable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentUponTheWrongSyllable">is pronouncing everything weirdly because apparently she thinks that's how scholars speak</a>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieBrooker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieBrooker">Charlie Brooker</a> told a story on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WouldILieToYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WouldILieToYou">Would I Lie to You?</a></em> about how he once tried to get out of trouble for not paying attention when his girlfriend was talking by claiming that he couldn't hear her because he was completely deaf in one ear. Of course, he then had to keep up the absurd pretense for years, occasionally forgetting what ear exactly he was supposed to be deaf in.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabIsraeliConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabIsraeliConflict">Six-Day War of 1967</a> comes out like this to someone who understands the events. You see, despite what both sides' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropagandaMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropagandaMachine">Propaganda Machine</a> has told you, Egyptian president <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GamalAbdelNasser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GamalAbdelNasser">Gamal Abdel Nasser</a> had no interest in fighting Israel, at least not in the short run, as it was a lose-lose for him and his pan-Arab vision: win, conquering Israel, and he would lose the main pan-Arab rallying point and thus all his leverage against the <em>real</em> enemy, the conservative Arab monarchies (like Saudi Arabia and Jordan) <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Cold_War">who opposed him and his vision<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>; lose, and lose credibility as leader of the Arabs (and thus lose leverage against the conservative Arab monarchies). However, Nasser had to <em>pretend</em> like he wanted war in order to maintain that selfsame credibility. From there, the war—already understood to be a farce conducted by gibbering idiots—looks like an episode of <em>Fawlty Towers</em>. To wit:
<ul><li> The USSR informs Egypt that Israel is massing troops to attack Syria. Israel is in fact doing nothing of the kind, but Egypt doesn't bother to fact check and immediately informs the Syrians and announces a big mobilization and public march on the Sinai, hoping to scare the Israelis into backing down.
</li><li> Since Israel was not in fact massing troops, this move instead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">scares the Israelis into mobilizing</a>. At about this time, Egypt learns that the USSR had at best been mistaken and at worst been lying.
</li><li> Finding himself in an embarrassing bind, Nasser tries to avoid war with another tactic: he publicly demands that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UnitedNations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UnitedNations">United Nations</a> peacekeeping force separating Egypt from Israel "redeploy" (whatever that means). This fails: The UN Secretary-General, to save <em>his</em> own ass (we wish we could explain why!) gives Nasser an ultimatum: either the peacekeeping forces withdraw entirely, or they don't move; clearly he's calculating that Nasser's known aversion to <em>actually</em> starting a war would give him an out and allow tensions to dissipate.
</li><li> Alas, the Sec-Gen miscalculated. The papers across the Arab world—not fully under Nasser's control—have been trumpeting Arab military superiority over the weeks since the first moves, and now the Arab public is liable to see any backing down as a sign of Nasser's weakness. Since he can't be seen to be weak, Nasser opts to expel the UN peacekeepers. Now nothing stands between Egypt, Israel, and war—and a few weeks later (thanks to all manner of dilly-dallying on both sides), Israel does indeed attack, devastatingly.
</li></ul></li><li> North Korea was once caught digging a tunnel under the DMZ. They then went and claimed it was not theirs and that it must have been set up by the South Koreans and Americans. The South Koreans and Americans then countered by showing pictures of a large, military-issue North Korean flag and digging tools the Koreans left down there. Then the North Koreans claimed that they did in fact dig the tunnel, but it was a coal mine. A coal mine under the most heavily guarded and politically sensitive border in the world, where coal has never been found and the geology does not support it. They backed up this next claim by showing investigators the "coal", which were clearly rocks coated with black paint. It's worth noting that North Korea is one of the largest producers and users of coal in the world, so they aren't exactly amateurs at finding the stuff and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadLiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadLiar">could have presented real coal they "found" in the "mine".</a>
