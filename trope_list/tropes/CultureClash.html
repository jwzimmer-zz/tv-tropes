<ul><li> A German commercial for a bank features a Japanese bank CEO going to Germany and making a traditional greeting bow in front of his German counterpart. Suddenly, a female employee creeps up to him and cuts off his tie with a pair of scissors, and then gives him a kiss, in the course of <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_Thursday">Weiberfastnacht.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>

After immersing himself in English culture, he returns to the comedy club and nails it.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Anime &amp; Manga </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceRunawayIdeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceRunawayIdeon">Space Runaway Ideon</a></em>, when humans first encounter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Buff Clan</a>, they try to call a ceasefire by raising a white flag. Unfortunately, in Buff Clan culture, a white flag means the resolve to fight until death. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">Much bloodshed ensues</a>.
</li><li> Played for humour in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei">Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei</a></em>, Kaere, a returnee is offended by various gestures that "in her country" mean odd things. Also, Maria is a reverse example, seeing negative things in Japanese society as positive things. Her reaction to a pedophile accosting a little girl? "People in Japan are so nice to little kids".
</li><li> A major part of the background of the Skypiea arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>. Montblanc Norland comes to an island plagued by disease and worshiping a snake-god. He proceeds to cut down their sacred trees and slay their god(dess), all in their own best interest. Though his actions were for the better, his refusal to consult with them or even explain himself demonstrates an arrogance that eventually alienates him, setting up the requisite tragic backstory.
</li><li> Interestingly subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiYoriAoshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiYoriAoshi">Ai Yori Aoshi</a></em>, for the character of Tina Foster — a blond, blue-eyed American who grew up in Japan. Being American, she's never really accepted by her classmates, due to the highly ethno-centric nature of Japanese society, despite having been raised there from a very young age. Returning to America for high school, she discovers that she is culturally much more Japanese than American, and finds herself an outsider again. Her overreactions to this result in her clashing with both cultures, and prevent her from making any close personal connections in either Japan or America, until she meets open-minded protagonist Hanabishi Kaoru several years prior to the beginning of the story.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub">Ouran High School Host Club</a></em>:
<ul><li> Played for laughs. Commoner Haruhi's life is so different from her ultra-rich schoolmates that they might as well live in different countries, and the experience goes both ways. Witness the hosts' befuddlement over "commoner wisdom" such as instant coffee.
</li><li> In the backstory, this was an early cause of contention between Tamaki (who was raised by his French mother) and Kyouya (pure Japanese). Tamaki kept suggesting all sorts of activities that Kyouya hated, but Japanese politeness required him to participate anyway. Eventually he got so pissed off that he snapped at Tamaki that he wasn't interested in his latest random scheme—which is a <em>huge</em> faux pas in Japanese culture. Tamaki just said "Okay, so what do you want to do instead?" After that, Kyouya was better about politely turning Tamaki down.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Ramen &amp; Gyoza volume of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Oishinbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Oishinbo">Oishinbo</a></em>, one of Shiro's superiors takes some out-of-town Chinese colleagues to his favorite noodle shop; only to have them stop dead when they see the restaurant, accuse him of deliberately insulting them, and threaten to break off relations with the Tozai News. Turns out the restaurant's name uses an old Japanese word for China that many Japanese see as no worse than old-fashioned, but the mainland Chinese consider highly insulting. Good thing Shiro has the connections to set things right.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KyoKaraMaoh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KyoKaraMaoh">Kyo Kara Maoh!</a></em>, Wolfram insults Yuuri's mother, so Yuuri slaps him. Wolfram's brothers beg Yuuri to take it back. Yuuri, who thinks he's just insulted Wolfram back, swears he never will. Turns out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMarriage">that's how they propose marriage around those parts</a>. The engagement stands for almost three straight seasons, and by the third everyone either considers them married or has forgotten about the proposal altogether. It can sometimes be hard to tell.
</li><li> There is a major culture clash between Ichigo and Byakuya in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>'s "saving <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Rukia</span>" arc.
</li><li> One of the prevalent themes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IkokuMeiroNoCroisee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IkokuMeiroNoCroisee">Ikoku Meiro no Croisée</a></em>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuriGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuriGenre">Yuri Genre</a> manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FlowerFlower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FlowerFlower">Flower Flower</a></em> revolves around this. Two princesses from separate countries are wed but their cultures clash. This leads to some interesting situations.
</li><li> A bit of this is to be expected in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em> as it is about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NationsAsPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NationsAsPeople">Nations as People</a>. An example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InscrutableOriental" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InscrutableOriental">Japan</a> telling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Keet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Keet">Italy</a> he must "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMarriage">assume responsibility</a>" (which is never actually followed up on) when the latter, who is much less reserved about his emotions and physical contact, hugs him.
</li><li> A major hurdle for Momoko in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalDoremi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalDoremi">Magical Doremi</a></em>. Being raised in the US for most of her life, early after her introduction she has a lack of tact, doesn't understand that Japanese schools don't allow jewelry as simple as her stud earring, and compares Hazuki's family retainer to a nanny. On the flip side, she does not appreciate when Tamaki accidentally insults her black friend.
</li><li> Asuka from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> was raised in Germany and, as a result, deals with Japanese cultural clashes. She's more brash than most of her classmates and complains about Japanese-style doors not having locks.
</li><li> The main character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AscendanceOfABookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AscendanceOfABookworm">Ascendance of a Bookworm</a></em> is a young Japanese woman who was reincarnated into the body of a child in a European-inspired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowFantasy">Low Fantasy</a> world. Early on, a major stumbling block on her journey to invent a printing press is the fact that she defaults to Japanese mannerisms most of the time, mainly prostrating herself and lowering her head when she's requesting something; in her new surroundings, this comes off as lacking backbone or even being untrustworthy (since she doesn't make eye contact) rather than a humble show of respect. Fortunately, she's able to befriend some upper-class merchants who teach her the proper etiquette for making deals.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PrincessUgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PrincessUgg">Princess Ugg</a></em> is built around this trope, as Ulga's barbarian ways do not fit in well at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrincessClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrincessClassic">Princess Classic</a> Academy. It's implied Jamsin once struggled with this as well, as she was reminded she did not know what Western utensils were when she came (having grown up with chopsticks).
</li><li> Xavin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em> often runs into this, being a Skrull who has been raised to kill ever since hatching. Most notably, Xavin has difficulty understanding that the team views Victor, who's an android, as an equal whereas the Xavin only saw him as a useful tool. Xavin also deeply respects strength in all of its forms and therefore doesn't understand why the team doesn't try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a> with their superior powers. Also, Xavin doesn't get that being genderfluid is unusual for humans because, for Skrulls, "changing gender is no different than changing hair color."
<ul><li> Klara, who joins the team later on, has her own difficulties adjusting, having come from the 1900s, where there were no Skrulls, no Majesdanians, and no androids, and where mutants and magic-users were viewed as possible demons.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Embers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Embers">Embers</a></em>, an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> fanfic by Vathara, failure to do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyCulturalComparison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyCulturalComparison">comparison</a> is shown to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureClash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureClash">incredibly painful results</a>... and arguably, this is one of the major reasons this story was written. A full chapter was dedicated to what the four elemental nations each mean when they say "truce", each of which was different, and had different cultural reasons behind it.
<ul><li> In the Water Tribes, a truce is decided upon by the women, who get together and decide that their men have wasted enough time and effort fighting, or are needed back home. Once they've determined that the men are rested and recovered, the truce is revoked and they go to war again.
</li><li> In the Earth Kingdom, the local King (or the Earth King, if it's a big enough deal), will declare a truce only as a final ceasefire, when either they or the enemy is thoroughly crushed. Truces aren't temporary... they <em>end</em> the war, and breaking the truce starts a new one.
</li><li> In the Fire Nation, the ranking officer can call for a truce at any time, but they will <em>hold</em> that truce without fail. They <em>will not</em> break a truce, but will revoke it and inform their enemy of the revocation before they attack.
</li><li> The Air Nomads don't <em>have</em> truces. They may stop fighting, or work together with an enemy for a while against a common foe, but there's nothing binding about it, and they can change their minds whenever they want, without informing anyone. This has led to them being generally liked but not trusted, and in <em>Embers</em>, has led to <strong>HUGE</strong> problems between the nations.

Neji kills Dr. Light so quickly and cleanly that the Teen Titans don't even realize what happened until they try to tie Dr. Light up and leave him for the police, like usual. In the ensuing discussion, the Shinobi and the Titans have difficulty understanding each other's viewpoint; only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">Naruto</a> is willing to give the idea of simply containing your enemies indefinitely a chance, but the reveal that all prisons in the DC-verse are made of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison">cardboard</a> makes him hesitate. Robin realizes that the League sent him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">Child Soldiers</a> to house, and calls Batman out accordingly. Ultimately, the Shinobi decide to accept "their land, their rules" as a counterargument, but make it clear they don't agree, while Dr. Light's crimes end up being severe enough for the police and civilians to accept his death as a necessity.
</li><li> A plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/UnderTheNorthernLights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/UnderTheNorthernLights">Under The Northern Lights</a></em>. The reindeer of Tarandroland have a very negative view of magic and have problems with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">unicorn-heavy Equestria</a>. Equestrians get nervous with both casual violence and the use of animal products, both common in Tarandroland.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/GameTheoryLyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/GameTheoryLyricalNanoha">Game Theory</a></em> plays up the cultural differences of the TSAB as a society that has access to magic, and the fact that Nanoha is from Earth and lacks an understanding of the history of magic (and the dangers thereof) is of significant importance to the plot.
</li><li> There are a few disagreements or misunderstandings in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em> fanfiction that often occur because Bilbo and the dwarves come from different cultures.
<ul><li> One occurs in <em><a class="urllink" href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/609041">Bilbo's Hair<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, where hobbits see braiding as an activity only done by women and something that's not very beneficial, whereas dwarves braid as a sign of status, courtship and friendship, as well as training the fingers and their eye-to-hand coordination for fighting and craftsmanship.
</li><li> In another fic, <em><a class="urllink" href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/731818/chapters/1359880">Into the Fire<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, Thorin and a few other dwarves mistakenly come to think that Bilbo is nobility since he owns land and collects money from his tenants, and is also a prince since his grandfather is the Thain (which they think is a title equivalent to king) of the Shire. The concept of a middle-class gentleman is after all hard to reconcile with the feudal system which most of Middle Earth operates on.
</li><li> In <a class="urllink" href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/3385085/chapters/7405448">Wear a Flower in Your Hair (You're Beautiful)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Thorin calls Bella <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">(femme Bilbo)</a> a halfling in reference to her being a hobbit. Unbeknownst to Thorin, "halfling" is an insult hobbits use to describe females who are barren. He is promptly horrified <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenMouthInsertFoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenMouthInsertFoot">at how badly he stuck his foot in his mouth</a> and <em>disgusted</em> that a culture would have such an insult; while children are prized among dwarves due to their rarity, no female is ever shamed for being unable to have children or choosing not to have them, in stark contrast to the hobbits who are family-oriented to such an extent that it's lead to immeasurable heartache for those in Bella's position. The author also notes that the dwarf culture, from their research, is surprisingly gender equal with the closest word to "queen" (what Bella will be after the dwarves' home is restored due to her marriage to Thorin) translating to "she who is the king's equal".

Among other things, he didn't know what soap was (when the composition of it was described, he thought it was food), and when Bulma asked about "protection" before having sex, he put on his combat armor.

</li><li> She similarly doesn't understand some Americanisms, being Italian, and has occasional visible reactions to sloppy protocol or ceremony from people who originally came from other backgrounds, as her own original service was a stickler for proper military protocol.

Nick is originally under the impression that it's because of his sharp teeth and is hurt that she still doesn't trust him but when he finally calls her mother in desperation to fix things, he discovers foot stamping is a dominance display and Judy felt devalued when he did it to her. As Bonnie puts it, "You may as well have slapped a leash on her and dangled her in the air by it for what it said about your opinion of her."

</li><li> Detective/action movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackRain">Black Rain</a></em> contains a ton of this when two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCityCops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCityCops">NYPD</a> detectives catch a rogue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a> member in New York and have to escort him back to Tokyo. In <em>some</em> ways the film is more even-handed than some works, as it shows the detectives feeling out of their depth and threatened by a different culture, but it also shows how they seem to the Japanese, which ranges from the Japanese police viewing them as bumbling amateurs, (one of the detectives being a xenophobic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Cowboy Cop</a> while the other is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeOfTheParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeOfTheParty">Life of the Party</a> sort) who let the Yakuza captive escape, to many others seeing them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyForeigner">Funny Foreigners</a>.
<ul><li> More subtly, there is also something of a generational culture clash going on among the Japanese.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Outsourced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Outsourced">Outsourced</a></em> centers on this theme as an American sales expert is sent to India to train call centre workers and only becomes successful once he starts adapting to his new home.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodsMustBeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodsMustBeCrazy">The Gods Must Be Crazy</a></em> uses this as its central theme. The main focus is on the Bushman !Xi venturing out into the world of modern South Africa, and getting into many misunderstandings due to his not knowing anything about its society's workings, and vice-versa. Said misunderstandings range from hilarious (accidentally sticking up somebody) to serious (getting locked up in prison).
</li><li> In the 2010 remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKarateKid2010" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKarateKid2010">The Karate Kid</a></em>, Dre (who comes from the United States) claps and cheers loudly after his crush's violin recital.

</li><li> One of the more interesting parts of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther2018">Black Panther (2018)</a></em> is the clash between Erik Killmonger and his <em>very</em> American attitude towards race, aggressive black supremacy ideals and pan-Africanist views with the Wakandans bemusement about race issues, rather smug and paternalistic superiority (not that it's unjustified, mind) and highly tribalistic view of the world. This comes to a point when Erik condemns Wakanda for not intervening to stop the transatlantic slave trade, and the Wakandans' reaction is basically a confused "Why should we have cared about people on <em>the other side of the goddamned continent</em>, and why should we care more about slaves sold to the English than slaves sold to the Dahomey?"

</li><li> This is the central theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CrazyRichAsians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CrazyRichAsians">Crazy Rich Asians</a></em>. Rachel is a middle class, renowned mathemathics professor from New York City who was raised by her sinlge mother, who emmigrated from China, and who raised Rachel with the idea to follow her dreams and maker her own way in life. This puts her at odds with her boyfriend Nick's mother Eleanor, a native of Singapore, and the daughter of a very wealthy family, who married into an even wealthier family, who also firmly believes of putting family over everything else, including personal desires, which in Nick's case is marrying Rachel, a woman of lower social standing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who was also the product of an adulterous affair,</span> becuase it will bring shame to the family.

Even worse, they were engaged in active research on jet killercraft and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">explosive-metal bombs</a>! All of this in the blink of an eye turret between their probe visiting and the Conquest Fleet arrival (about 800 years, they arrive in 1942). There is also all that biological weirdness. For starters, they're big and ugly, they stand up at too steep of an angle, have no tailstumps and these weird multi-colored strands on their heads. Speaking of colors, their strangely smooth and non-scaly skin comes in as many colors as their head-growths. Don't even get me started on their bizarre mating habits, it took the more liberal members of the Conquest fleet nearly the entire 40 years (20 local years) between the end of hostilities and the arrival of the Colonization fleet to reach a personal understanding that, for them, being capable of mating at all times of the year is just natural (an American Tosevite who has become an expert in Race/Tosevite relations commented to the insanely radical Shiplord Straha that, to him, Straha is "more hidebound than a Southern Democrat with 40 years seniority" after the Shiplord called himself a Radical. This occurred before the end of hostilities in the Local Year 1944). Their exclusive mating agreements are something only such a screwed up race such as the Big Uglies could find enjoyable. Speaking of mating issues, that herb Ginger should be wiped out, it causes nothing but trouble.

A rather blatant example is when certain Japanese taking care of him, after being commanded to cater to his every need, politely ask him if he'd like sex with one of the girls looking after him. When he declines embarrassed, they ask if he'd prefer a man.... and then whether he'd prefer a boy!
</li><li> A minor example occurs in Chen Yi's house in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Conqueror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Conqueror">Lords of the Bow</a></em>.

Many conflicts ensue.
</li><li> A common theme of indie author M.C.A. Hogarth's books. In particular the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParadoxUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParadoxUniverse">Paradox Universe</a></em> which features a loose Alliance composed of dozens of genetically engineered "Pelted" races who developed widely differing cultures during the exodus from earth on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationShips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationShips">Generation Ships</a>, as well as a few completely alien species.

The Lord decides he'd much rather just pillage the original King's lands since he's away and requesting help. The suggestion does come from his son, and it's meant to be a shock to the reader, but you'd think that *someone* would point out that the islanders come from a completely different culture that's prone to murder, raiding and deceit.

She is of Valyrian blood, the people that annihilated the old Ghiscari empire, and she absolutely despises the cultures and traditions of her new nation. The biggest is Meereen's practice of slavery, a trade which Dany stops, causing Meereen's economy to crash and the other slaving cities to declare war on her. She attempts to walk a middle ground by marrying a Ghiscari noble and re-opening the beloved slave pits, but this backfires and causes things to go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">From Bad to Worse</a>.
</li><li> Jon Snow similarly has trouble negotiating between King Stannis' people and the wildlings. For example, the sister-in-law of the King Beyond the Wall, Val, is viewed by Stannis' people as a valuable asset and a princess with many knights and nobles asking for her hand in marriage to seal an alliance between them and Val's people, the free folk. Jon Snow repeatedly has to explain that she is not viewed by her people as a princess since "King Beyond the Wall" is not an inherited position, but an earned one, and must tell Stannis that he cannot make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Val</a>, as one of the free folk, marry a man she does not agree to wed and if he does, shell likely retaliate. Jon further explains that even if Val does accept this man, it does not mean that Stannis will have the allegiance of the wildlings — as again — the free folk do not see Val as their princess but as simply the sister-in-law of their king.

After their first conversation, rumors abound that Pippin is a hobbit prince (which is technically true since Pippin's father Paladin Took is the current Thain, but the Thain's only function is to lead defenders if the Shire is invaded); that he is in Minas Tirith to negotiate an alliance, which is false (except perhaps on a personal level); and that an army of hobbits is on its way to reinforce Minas Tirith (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaHaHaNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaHaHaNo">Ha Ha Ha No</a>). In appendix E, Tolkien states that Westron (the common tongue of Middle-Earth, which was rendered as English in the books), has two second-person pronouns, one formal and one informal, but that the formal one has fallen into disuse in the Hobbit dialect. The implication is that someone overheard Pippin talking to Denethor, assumed no-one who wasn't at least a Prince would dare to assume to be on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis">First-Name Basis</a> with the Steward of Gondor at a first meeting, and the rumor mill just spun off from there. Meanwhile, Pippin was just talking to the Steward in the same way he talks to everyone, from his neighbors to Gandalf to Orcs.
</li><li> During book 1 of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TairenSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TairenSoul">Tairen Soul</a></em> series, one of the Fey flies over to a Celierian woman and talks to her briefly (throwing up a magical wall around both of them). The woman doesn't know his language and thinks that he's just told her he's about to kill her. In actuality, this was the Fey's way of saying "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalLove">Hello</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueLove">soulmate</a>."

</li><li> A major theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hellspark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hellspark">Hellspark</a></em>, which is set in an interstellar future with a wide variety of societies, and features a community of people who were forced to live together without adequate preparation for their cultural differences. At the point when the protagonist shows up and starts mediating, there are people about ready to kill their neighbors over apparently little things like what kind of boots they wear.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DreambloodDuology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DreambloodDuology">Dreamblood Duology</a></em>, this is common between Kisuati and Gujaareen, even when the Gujaareen are of the shunha caste and stick very close to their Kisuati roots. The main point of contention is the dominant religion of Gujaareh, namely Hananja's Law. The Kisuati view the Gujaareen custom of Gatherer priests gathering — read: killing — people in their dreams when 'their time has come' as barbaric.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Victoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Victoria">Victoria</a></em> has many, but the most obvious is the ultimate one: Azania versus the Confederation. Or, briefly explained, a society of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand">mostly lesbian, tech-optimistic Amazons</a> versus one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilReactionary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilReactionary">reactionary Christian fundamentalists</a>.

</li><li> The short story <em>The All-American Slurp</em> is about a Chinese immigrant family's struggles to integrate into American culture.
<ul><li> When they are invited to dinner by their neighbors, the Gleasons, they politely refuse the offer of sour cream dip, as most Chinese people don't eat dairy products. Later, they pull the strings out of the celery sticks before eating them, which surprises the neighbors. They also misunderstand the concept of a buffet dinner; when they see the table piled with food but no chairs around it, they bring some chairs over, only to be told that they're supposed to take food from the table and eat it in the living room.
</li><li> The mother buys a skirt for her daughter to wear to school, but later sees that all the other girls are wearing jeans.
</li><li> When eating at a fancy restaurant, they slurp their soup (in Chinese culture, this cools the liquid while also showing appreciation for the meal), and the other diners give them strange looks. The daughter is so embarrassed that she flees into the bathroom.
</li><li> At the end, the family gets to see this trope from their point of view when they invite the Gleason family to dinner at their house. Meg, the daughter, takes food from multiple dishes at the buffet table, when the Chinese custom is to take from one dish and finish the serving before taking from another. Mrs. Gleason mixes the prawns, gravy and rice together on her plate, and Mr. Gleason struggles with using a pair of chopsticks.

Even knowing that Kyousuke isn't interested in her job doesn't make Rachel feel better, because she knows she <em>should</em> want her royal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Protectorate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Protectorate">Protectorate</a> to have the best bodyguard available, but at the same time she wants to keep the status she's worked so hard for, and she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicBigot">culturally hardwired to perceive all her peers as rivals</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TroyRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TroyRising">The Hot Gate</a></em>, after Dana "Comet" Parker is transferred to the <em>Thermopylae</em>, she is put in charge of an all-male team of South American engineers. Her being female immediately puts her at odds, and her being a "norte" (North American) is seen as even worse. And she actually demands that they do their jobs maintaining the shuttles? *Gasp*! How dare she? Doesn't she know that every single one of them is a scion of a powerful South American family? People like them are there merely to bide their time until they are inevitably made officers. Who does this American farm girl think she is? She is "educated" several times in the ways of Latin America and the concept of "class" not just as an economic divider (the way it's treated in the US and most of the Western world), but in how only "the right people" should be put in top positions, with everyone else being "rabble". It works the other way too, with South American officials having trouble understanding someone like Tyler Vernon, automatically ascribing him certain qualities simply because he's the richest guy in the world and only meets with the President of the US when his (Tyler's) schedule opens up. One of Parker's subordinates, who has picked up a few things, explains to his father that Tyler doesn't fit into their "upper class" mold. He's a typical American billionaire, who only wants to get rich, without trying to adjust his own culture to that of his financial peers.
<ul><li> Parker gets an even worse reaction from the Pathans, Afghan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines">Space Marines</a>, who were, until only a few decades ago, fighting the US as insurgents.

Masters of Formalities are there to mediate between the various noble houses that run the planets of the galaxy.

</li><li> While the Dothraki call Jorah Mormont "the Andal," the Mormonts are actually blood of the First Men. The Andals are the Saxon invaders to the original Briton occupants of Westeros. In the books, the Andals were a second migration thousands of years after the First Men, bringing (among other things) the seven-in-one god you hear about. They settled primarily in the south of Westeros, and their influence is not felt much above the Neck; northerners claim to descend solely from the First Men, keep the "old gods" by worshiping at a heart tree, and generally do not become knighted because the Faith of the Seven invented that office. To most peoples of Essos though, all Westerosi simply are "Andals". Jorah doesn't bother correcting them either.

Most significant is their handling of criminal punishment. While the Ark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual">uses capital punishment left and right</a>, they view it as a utilitarian measure (no sense wasting precious resources on someone who breaks the law), and so make it fairly clean and painless, and even then they refuse to execute anyone under the age of 18. This makes them pretty hesitant to hand Finn over to the Grounders for punishment, since Grounder executions <strong>a)</strong> don't have exemptions for minors, and <strong>b)</strong> are more about revenge than utility, involving lengthy torture sessions where everyone with a grievance against the accused gets a chance to go at them with fire and knives.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>, the Clans have spent the past three hundred years away from the rest of humanity, developing their own culture of military strength and honor. When they returned to the Inner Sphere, much Cultural Clashing ensued. Inner Sphere armies were shocked when the Clans simply asked who they were going to be fighting rather than spending resources on an intelligence network. The Clans were likewise shocked when the Inner Sphere lied to then and then arranged for long-term battles of exhaustion rather than the quick and clean combat Clan culture demanded.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>:
<ul><li> This is very prevalent within the Imperium. To start with, the Imperium itself is composed of the almost entirely separate Imperium proper and the Mechanicus, only united because they decided to agree that their gods are the same person. There's plenty of culture clash ranging everywhere from simple misunderstandings to outright bigotry on both sides. On top of that, with tens of millions of different worlds and relatively difficult travel between them, huge numbers of very different cultures have evolved. Every time someone from one world visits another, or even just part of their own world that they're not familiar with, you can guarantee this trope will come up. And then you have all the interactions between the various different military forces, with the differences in culture and traditions between regiments from different worlds being the least of it before you even start looking at the various fanatical superhumans.
</li><li> While most xenos and humans are usually too busy literally clashing to even look at each other's culture, this happens on occasion. Da Orks for example are rather confused by human command structure. Due to the way Ork biology works, an Ork's authority is proportionate to their size. It's easy to tell a Warboss from a Nob since the Warboss will tower over his subordinates. Humans on the other hand are more or less all the same size, and sometimes <em>shorter</em> ones are the ones in charge. Orks however have figured out that the humans in charge usually wear fancier hats.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> also has quite a bit of this. The Empire is mainly based on part-medieval, part-early industrial revolution Germany, but the "good" factions also include various other European influences, particularly French aristocracy and British Arthurian legends (themselves largely based on the culture clash between traditional Celtic culture and the rise of Christianity). Elves, dwarves and humans are nominally on the same side, but often come into conflict due to misunderstanding, or deliberate dismissal, of each others' cultures.
</li><li> This is a constant theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RocketAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RocketAge">Rocket Age</a></em> and the source of most of the setting's conflicts. Humanity makes huge assumptions about alien cultures, such as labeling the entire Martian courtesan sub-caste prostitutes, rather than the complicated geisha-like role they actually serve, or applying the moral norms of the 1930s to alien cultures with more open values. On the other side of the coin many Martians can't comprehend how human society works without castes or slavery.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> animated series, the Clans believe that if you are captured, you have to serve your captors. The Inner Sphere believes that if captured, your first duty is to escape. This is the cause of much culture clash — the Inner Sphere suspects their captive of attempting sabotage...and upon finally being honorably freed by her clan, the prisoner is disgusted by the Inner Sphere's lack of honor, more convinced than ever that they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> barbarians who have to be forcibly "civilized" by the Clans. Meanwhile, the treacherous Inner Sphere captive of the Clans goes unsuspected because they believe in his promise of service. This is actually an aspect of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGame">Tabletop Game</a> lore which they decided to highlight.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em>, the Scotsman and his family repeatedly mock Jack's outfit, saying he is wearing a basket on his head and a dress, and mock his katana for being small compared to their claymores. When Jack tries to greet them by bowing, they ask him why he bent over and stared at the ground. On the flip side, Jack cannot stand bagpipe music and most Scottish cuisine.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheBraveAndTheBold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheBraveAndTheBold">Batman: The Brave and the Bold</a></em>, both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JonahHex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JonahHex">Jonah Hex</a> and Batman's old sensei mock Batman's costume.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HouseOfMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HouseOfMouse">House of Mouse</a></em> episode "Mickey and the Culture Clash", where Mickey reads a letter in the newspaper saying Minnie wants a more 'sophisticated' boyfriend. He tries to be more fancy, but then finds out it's all a trick by Mortimer so he can steal Minnie away from Mickey.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> An animal version of this happens in the episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS1E9BridleGossip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS1E9BridleGossip">Bridle Gossip</a>" when several of the locals mistake Zecora <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurryReminder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurryReminder">pawing for water</a> as a threat display, and only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanAndAScholar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanAndAScholar">Twilight Sparkle,</a> who already knows about zebras, isn't scared (at first). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">Note that this is a real difference between zebras and horses.</a>
</li><li> In "Luna Eclipsed", Princess Luna tries to be regal and gracious in Ponyville, using the patterns of behavior and speech that she remembers from over a thousand years ago. She <em>terrifies</em> everyone — save for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanAndAScholar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanAndAScholar">Twilight Sparkle,</a> who knows enough about both cultural history <em>and</em> royal protocol to realize what Luna is attempting to convey by her conduct.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens in the third season opener of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobAndMargaret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobAndMargaret">Bob and Margaret</a></em>, when the titular couple moves from England to Canada.
</li><li> The Almighty Tallest (and likely the Irken society in general) of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em> are completely <em>baffled</em> when they learn that humans aren't ranked by height. They have trouble wrapping their minds of people taller than the average Irken but on average incredibly stupid. Dib is similarly gobsmacked when he realizes the Tallest are only leaders by virtue of being, well, the tallest.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> had the boat from Avalon take Goliath and company to Japan, where they ended up assisting a group of Japanese gargoyles. As the sun was rising and they were preparing to pose before they turned to stone for the day, Goliath learned of differing customs. Whereas Western Gargoyles face outward and assume intimidating poses to scare invaders, Eastern Gargoyles face <em>inward</em> and assume poses of benediction to reassure the residents inside.
<ul><li> This initially caused some issues between Goliath and Angela. Angela, having been brought up by humans, wished for her father to acknowledge her as his daughter. Gargoyle tradition dictates that gargoyle children were always to be treated as the children of the entire clan and not claimed by their actual parents, which is why Goliath is unwilling to claim Angela as his daughter.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy">Ed, Edd n Eddy</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyForeigner">Rolf</a> is a frequent source of this.
<ul><li> In "Pop Goes the Ed", he apparently regards the quiche Jimmy brought to the party as bad luck.
<div class="indent"><strong>Rolf:</strong> It is the food of (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattyLipBurbling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattyLipBurbling">Batty Lip Burbling</a></em>)! The party is <em>cursed!</em>
</div></li><li> In "Dueling Eds", Rolf is deeply insulted and ashamed that Eddy threw the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignQueasine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignQueasine">sea cucumber balls</a> he served at a party. So much, he asks everyone to trod on his face on their way out of the party, and later is seen having <em>buried himself alive</em>, with only a funnel to breathe through, as part of some weird penance ritual. When Eddy tries to offer a potted plant as a token of forgiveness, Rolf just gets angry that Eddy gave him "the potted shrub of ridicule" and challenges Eddy to a duel. After Eddy suffers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No-Holds-Barred Beatdown</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamuFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamuFu">involving fish,</a> Rolf offers everyone present to dump the "Eels of Forgiveness" down their pants, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain">gets mad when Kevin refuses to join in.</a>

<ul><li> The reason why translators, lawyers and diplomats exist.
</li><li> Although "colored" is considered a pejorative in the USA and the UK, in South Africa, it has no negative connotations, used ubiquitously to refer to mixed-race people.
</li><li> In the West, slurping food is generally rude, but in Japan, it's completely normal and expected. Similarly, the Chinese shovel food into their mouths by holding onto their bowls with their other hand and putting them right up to their mouth, because putting your head down over your food while you eat is seen as eating like a dog.
</li><li> Most Western and Middle-Eastern cultures consider food being left uneaten as a sign of disrespect to either the host's skills or hospitality. On the contrary, leaving food uneaten in China suggests that it was enough, and eating everything that you've been served can imply that the host has failed to provide you with enough food. Woe betide you if you're invited for dinner by a Middle Eastern/Chinese couple...
</li><li> As noted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanesePoliteness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanesePoliteness">Japanese Politeness</a> trope, Japan averts this with respect to flags. Not wanting to curtail the citizens right to Freedom of Speech, but also not wanting to show disrespect, Japan outlawed all Flag Burning except for the Japanese Flag.
</li><li> Much of Korea and China's dislike of Japan is the result of this trope. Japanese culture makes it extremely taboo to make your "group" look bad to outsiders. Your group includes things like your family, your class, your company, your nation, etc. Naturally, this led to Japan not liking to discuss their role in WWII, which comes off as insensitive to Koreans and Chinese war victims. The United States, with its own share of shameful past, generally is a bit more forgiving of Japan, but some circles still are taken aback with how little the subject comes up in Japan's history courses. This is especially true when compared to Germany, who are very open about how they are remorseful for their WWII involvement.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds">McDonald's</a> struggled when it first entered the India market in the mid-90s because it didnt do the proper market research into cultural dietary differences. They found out that people were interested in American food but they didnt think to tweak the American menu to fit local culture/tastes. Indian customers were given a menu of Big Macs, chicken tenders, and fries just like American customers. The problem is that roughly half of all people in India are vegetarians for religious reasons and everything at McDonalds is cooked with beef fat (which even non-vegetarian Hindus wont eat) so there quite literally was nothing for half a billion people to eat. The ingredients werent given either, so people werent willing to risk eating something that wasnt vegetarian anytime a new item was introduced. They would eventually go back to the drawing board and create a specific line for the Indian market but it wasnt until 2018 that the subsidiary made a profit.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders">Just Following Orders</a> is an example of this. In German Law, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeDegreesOfMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeDegreesOfMurder">Three Degrees of Murder</a> is set by the motivation of the accused when committing the crime. Thus the sentence is set based on the charge. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCommonLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCommonLaw">The Common Law</a>, motivation plays no part in the charges but rather the planning or intent to commit the act. Motive comes into play only after guilt is established. So, to British and American members of the court, the "justification" came off as more severe because not only were they admitting to playing a part in a premeditated crime (which is the most severe of the murder charges) but upon guilt, they could now say that at no point did they see their actions as wrong, which doesn't help at sentencing.
</li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>, the Japanese dev team would constantly apologize for the delays and screw ups, which would be a typical form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanesePoliteness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanesePoliteness">Japanese Politeness</a>. However, constant apologies in the West is seen as insincere since the apologizer isn't rectifying their mistakes (for example, always screwing up in school and apologizing for the mistakes while still making the same mistakes over and over). The head English localizer of the game grew frustrated to the point of outright telling the Japanese team that constant apologies was making everyone view the dev team as untrustworthy, despite being polite about the apologies. This got the team to see the error of their ways and vow to not repeat the same mistakes.
</li><li> In the United States, tipping your waiter or waitress is common and shows the employee that you valued their services whereas not tipping them or tipping very low shows that you did not like the service. In Japan, adding a tip is considered to be very rude due how people view it as you assuming that they don't make enough money or need money out of pity.
</li><li> When reviewing the work of a Japanese client, avoid using the phrase "exceeds expectations". While in the West, it's a way of saying a really good job was done, it's taken more literally in Japan, leading them to wonder if you had low expectations of their ability if their work exceeded it.
</li><li> Gandhi ran afoul of this in the wake of Kristalnacht, when he advised the German Jewish community to commit mass suicide in response to German persecution. In so doing, Gandhi was speaking from a tradition in which it is common for people to commit suicide publicly to call attention to an oppressive regime (cf. the Buddhist self-immolations in South Vietnam and the Falun Gong in China). Perhaps Gandhi imagined that a Jewish mass suicide would expose the extent of Nazi barbarity and possibly even bring down the Reich. However, in the West, telling someone to commit suicide is inherently and grossly offensive, not to mention that, in following Gandhi's advice, the Jews would have been furthering the Nazis' goals. Consequently, to this day, Gandhi is less well-regarded in the Jewish community than in the rest of the West.
</li><li> One of these was a major reason that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM">Metroid: Other M</a></em> was such a flop. The creators wanted to try and market the games to Japanese gamers better, as the series tended to sell better in the US and most of Europe. To do this, they changed main character Samus Aran into a childish, submissive, naïve, clumsy devoted solider to her former boss. This was meant to make her the ideal women in Japanese eyes. The director of the game, Yoshio Sakamoto, even boasted about how loveable he made her. However, American gamers were <em>not happy</em> as the Samus they all loved was the stoic, no-nonsense, independent bounty hunter from past games. And because <em>Metroid</em> gets most of its sales from the West, this resulted in a flop and Samus returning to her former personality.
