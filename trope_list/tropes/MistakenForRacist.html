<ul><li> Let's just note up front that comic book heroes in the 1940s and 1950s were almost exclusively either Caucasian (or at least <em>looked</em> Caucasian, e.g. Superman) or their ethnicity was their defining characteristic, and usually not in a good way (Whitewash Jones). Sometime in the 1960s, the comic book companies discovered there was an ethnic market out there they could skim more dimes from. The first batch of non-white heroes that were more than simply stereotypes tended to have names that let you know right off the bat what you were dealing with ("<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackLightning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackLightning">Black Lightning</a>"). Then someone with slightly more of a clue realized that just shading someone darker and putting "black" (or "El" for Hispanic heroes) in front of their names was maybe not all that much <em>better</em>. Cue stories with all the subtlety of a chainsaw about how racism is <em>bad</em>, kids! And expect heroes who are and have always been very level-headed suddenly realizing in an anvilicious manner just how <strong>racist</strong> they've been for all these years. A lot of the stories below hail from this time period.
</li><li> An issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a> getting extremely upset by the idea that the team needs to induct a minority member in order to diversify its line-up. His opposition becomes extreme enough that Duanne and Triathlon (who are both black) begin to insinuate that Tony is in fact, a racist. He tries to deny this, stating that he believes that the Avengers should only be the "best of the best" regardless of race, but he ultimately stops arguing after noting that he is indeed beginning to sound like a bigot.
<ul><li> While never saying that Tony is a racist, the narrative itself does go out of its way to try and justify the idea of diversifying the team. The Wasp for instance is shocked and upset when she realizes that there have only been a handful of non-white Avengers in the team's history, and an earlier issue by the same author has an African-American man noting that he wished the Avengers had some diversity so that his son could see that people like him could be heroes too.
</li><li> Strange enough this issue has been in Avengers many times before. During the '80s the government and the people in the streets wanted the Avengers to be more diverse. The Avengers asked Black Panther to join them, but he turned them down since he didn't want to be the "Black Guy in the Team".
</li></ul></li><li> There was a story arc in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WestCoastAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WestCoastAvengers">West Coast Avengers</a></em> involving nearly half the team quitting and forming their own short-lived splinter group over the issue of using lethal force in crimefighting. At one point, this team, composed of Mockingbird, Moon Knight and Tigra encounter Dr. Bill Foster, also known as the superhero Black Goliath, and later Giant-Man. At the end of their adventure together, Foster leaves, and the mentally disturbed Moon Knight quips "Good riddance! That man is not our kind!", prompting Tigra to rebuke his apparent bigotry. Moon Knight denies this, explaining that he was referring to the fact that Foster is not a killer like the rest of them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a></em> was accused of racism in the '90s, in the <a class="urllink" href="http://berkeleyplacecomics.wordpress.com/2013/03/12/avengers-326-328-first-appearance-of-rage/">issue that introduced<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> the "Harlem hero" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngryBlackMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngryBlackMan">Rage</a>. He got in Cap's face to angrily demand why "Earth's Mightiest Heroes" were almost entirely white people.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics">Archie Comics</a> had this in a comic where Veronica has a party. She tells Archie that she doesn't want certain friends of his there. Since he's hanging out with Chuck and Jughead at the time, he thinks she means Chuck (who's black) and becomes angry. Turns out she means Jughead, who tends to be a slob and rather greedy with the food.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a>: After the Fall</em> Spike tells Angel he has "bigger fish to fry". Betta George, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant">Canon Immigrant</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesAsMuchSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesAsMuchSenseInContext">telepathic fish</a> demon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak">thingy</a>, is offended by this and calls him a racist.
</li><li> Played for laughs in issue #9 of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GrantMorrisonsActionComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GrantMorrisonsActionComics">Grant Morrison's run</a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ActionComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ActionComics">Action Comics</a></em>, which focused on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift">black</a>. The Lex Luthor of that Earth is still a light-skinned man, and upon being arrested, is shown arguing that he is not a racist and hates Superman because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">he's an alien</a>, not because he's black.
</li><li> Happens with the fame-hungry villain Screwball in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SuperiorSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SuperiorSpiderMan">Superior Spider-Man</a></em>. She refuses to attack a woman she deems to be "too ethnic" because she's worried that it would make her seem like a racist.
</li><li> In an infamous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em> comic from the 1970s, Hal Jordan enters a neighborhood full of African-American families to deal with a mugging, and is quickly accused of racism by everyone. An elderly black man points out that Hal patrols the galaxy helping and protecting aliens, but hardly ever helps the black people. Hal is very shaken up by this, apparently forgetting that when he saves the world as part of the Corps or the Justice League, he saves it for, you know, every single race and ethnicity, not just light-skinned people. Then again, a recurring Inuit member of his support characters was "lovingly" referred to as Pieface (which all modern incarnations establish said character only being called that by actual racists).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Marvel</a></em>
<ul><li> At one point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderVerse">Spider-Verse</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UltimateSpiderMan">Miles Morales</a> and the Spider-Man from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em> TV show team up with the Spider-Man from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderMan1967" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderMan1967">60's animated series</a>. When Miles unmasks, the 60's Spider-Man is visibly shocked, causing the animated Ultimate Spidey to think he's a racist. Instead, it turns out that 60's Spidey is proud to learn that the Spider-Man legacy has lived on, and was actually expressing shock at the fact that the new Spider-Man is so young.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Ultimate Cartoon Peter Parker:</strong> <em>(addressing the fourth wall)</em> Oh, snap! Don't tell me "Spider-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen">Mad Men</a></em>" is old-fashioned in bad ways, too!
</div><ul><li> A similar joke occurs in <em>Divided We Fall</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungAvengers">Stature</a> captures Miles after being brainwashed by the Mind Gem, and states that the new Spider-Man isn't what she was expecting. Miles calls her a racist in his internal narration but then realizes she was likely referring to the fact that he's only 13-years old.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateFF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateFF">Ultimate FF</a></em>: Van Damme gets into the interrogation cell, grabs Miles Horhames (an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicAnimalAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicAnimalAdaptation">Anthropomorphic Animal Adaptation</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MilesMorales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MilesMorales">Miles Morales</a> as a pig) and says "tell the truth or die, swine". Miles thought that was racist.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/KnightsOfTheDinnerTable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/KnightsOfTheDinnerTable">Knights of the Dinner Table</a></em>: While attending Garycon, B.A. gets covered in dye from an exploding dye pack when Dave attempts to open Brian's briefcase (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">It Makes Sense in Context</a>). He attempts to remove it with lighter fluid and only succeeds in smearing it all over his face and hands, making it look like he is in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackFace">Black Face</a>. After several people make comments about how offensive his costume is, Sheila is able to explain it away as a (very poor) Drow cosplay.
</li><li> During Ben Reilly's tenure as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga">The Clone Saga</a></em>, he was acting on information from his boss about her ex-husband when he decided to keep tabs on her son for her after she said she was concerned for her son's well-being around him and that he wasn't reliable, thus was hostile towards the man. The man in question was an African-American undercover cop who thought Ben was a racist because he wasn't aware that Ben worked for his ex-wife and Ben was acting on she said.
</li><li> In an early issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Spawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Spawn">Spawn</a></em>, title character Al Simmons (who is black himself) is mistaken by a southern black man for a klansman thanks to his red cloak and mask, which leads him to take off the mask and reveal his scarred face.
</li><li> Similarly, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supreme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supreme">Supreme</a></em>, Jack O'Lantern's ghostly costume causes a race-hate group member to assume he's ready for a meeting. Might count as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">Stylistic Suck</a>, since the first thing people assume when they see Jack's costume is that he's ready for a Halloween party.

Finally, Oliver Jones' father (who is black and moderately conservative) assured him, "On behalf of all black people, we do not, repeat, NOT, hate you!"
</li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/ForBetterOrForWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/ForBetterOrForWorse">For Better or for Worse</a></em> storyline has a new family move in next door while Michael and Elizabeth are still kids.

<div class="indent"><strong>J</strong>: Keep in mind, just because you see a black man driving a car, does not mean he stole it! &lt;pause&gt; Okay, I <em>did</em> steal this one - but <em>not because I'm black!</em>
</div></li><li> In the post-credits scene of <em>My Boss's Daughter</em>, when Hans (the daughter's ex-boyfriend) is sent to Thailand to oversee the new factory, he's told "You people! Back of bus!" by a bus driver. At first, he thinks it's because he's black, but the driver then yells "Smoker! Back of bus!" Hans then raises his other hand, holding a cigarette, and the scene cuts to several people smoking at the back of the bus.

The police officer Hank (White) played by Steve Zahn confronts Earl and mistakes him for a car thief trying to break into the car. However, immediately after Earl is cuffed a bumblebee arrives and, as Earl is allergic to bumblebees, Hank attempts to swat the bee away to protect Earl from a potentially lethal reaction. Unfortunately, all that the bystanders see is a white cop savagely swinging a nightstick near a hand-cuffed black man, and to top it off the bee <em>does</em> manage to sting Earl. Afterward, with a jittery recording of the encounter on the news and Earl seemingly bruised from the beating (But really just swollen from the bee sting) Hank was convicted with aggravated assault by an all-black jury (and a single timid white guy) and sentenced to six months in prison. To be sure, the DA is initially reluctant to pursue the case, but Hank's Lieutenant insists that letting Hank off would result in a race riot.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DenzelWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DenzelWashington">Denzel Washington</a> film <em>Out of Time</em>, an older woman is at a police station reporting on a prowler and excitedly identifies Denzel's character as the culprit. When it's revealed that he is the chief of police, she uncertainly starts pointing out other people of color as the culprit and is dismissed as racist. However, the audience knows that Denzel really <em>was</em> the culprit.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RushHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RushHour">Rush Hour</a></em> movie combines this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NWordPrivileges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NWordPrivileges">N-Word Privileges</a> when Carter (who's black) and Lee (who's Asian) go to a pool hall.

While Carter goes into a back room to interrogate a source, Lee tries to start a friendly chat with the bartender using the same line (to be fair, though, Carter <em>had</em> previously instructed him to "follow my lead, and do what I do").

The schoolmate remembers Hunkee since he and the other kids always pick him last when playing basketball due to the fact he was black. But Hunkee reveals a funny shocker to his classmate: it turns out the other kids picked him last not because he was black but because he was a horrible basketball player! The ironic part was the classmate is now a famous NBA player which Hunkee think he's joking. The classmate is bewildered by this revelation.

She assumes he's racist, and while he's sputtering, trying to explain himself, she correctly figures out that the other two witnesses and the victim were all white. Eastwood's character tells her she's "making it into a race thing" and tells her the condemned man he's trying to save is <em>also</em> black. She tells him the man he came to see has been dead for three years and asks him where he was when he got stabbed.

As it turns out, the two students whom he has never seen are black, and because "spook" is (besides its other meanings) a slur for black people, the professor is accused of racism. Silk turns to his black fellows for support, but feels betrayed when they do not take his side, and eventually resigns from his position.

As it turns out, the two students whom he has never seen are black, and because "spook" is (besides its other meanings) also a slur for black people, the professor is accused of racism. The conflict escalates until Silk resigns from his job in protest. The faculty admits he probably was not intentionally being racist, but he just shouldn't have used that word. It is implied that the faculty was resentful because he created some unpopular tenure reforms.

Heyward has a hard time convincing Munro that he just happens to be attracted to Alice more than to Cora (the novel at that point already has established that he in fact greatly admires Cora for her spirit and inner strength). It did not help that Heyward is English, as the crusty Scotsman Munro sees racism against blacks and people with black ancestry as a very English prejudice.

</div></li><li> One episode has Lily tell Gloria she's gay (out of misunderstanding the term; her friends parents are Italian, so that makes him Italian, so if her parents are gay, that makes her gay). Cameron and Mitchell try to explain to her, but it comes out as "You're not gay, you're just confused." A lesbian couple passing by shoots them angry looks, leading Cameron to apologize by saying "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeOfMyBestFriendsAreX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeOfMyBestFriendsAreX">Some of our best friends are lesbians</a>," which doesn't help. Mitchell has to point out the better solution would have been pointing out that they are, in fact, a gay couple. Gloria then decides that she should take Manny to visit their home country so he can keep in touch with his roots. Cameron agrees, but unfortunately, it comes out as, "The world would be better off if everyone just went back to where they came from." The other patrons in the Asian restaurant they're in seem none too happy at his remark.

To win her back, he gets the golfer to hold up a radio playing a silly love song as his golf clubs burn in front of her apartment. The man who lives below her is black and thinks they're burning a cross on his lawn because of the way the clubs have accidentally been arranged. Earl kicks the bag of golf clubs over when he realizes this, and this happens:

He sings about how he and Constance, with their blond hair and blue eyes, are special and should rule the world, but a conspiracy of money-grubbers tries to hold them down. Then the song ostensibly describes the path to stardom as "a midnight train" to a place where they "brand you with a star" and "give with a number". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">Does This Remind You of Anything?</a>?

Marion has been racelifted to be half Aboriginal and also given an explicit crush on her geography teacher. When Miss McCraw rebuffs Marion's Valentine, she does so on the grounds that such a student-teacher relationship would be wrong, but unfortunately also makes the mistake of telling Marion to leave "before anyone sees you". As the headmistress had just made Marion a job offer but said she would have to stay out of sight of parents because of her race, this comes across to Marion as Miss McCraw rejecting her for the same reason and trying to put a fig leaf over it, rather than genuinely trying to avoid a bad power dynamic.

</div><ul><li> Another episode contains a flashback where JD is mistaken for racist against blacks when he shows up in black-face at a black fraternity while the white-faced Turk dropped the joke at the last second to talk to a cute girl.
</li><li> In one episode Dr. Cox tells Turk he doesn't approve of "you people". Turk has just enough time to get offended before Dr. Cox finishes his blanket insult, declaring, in his own special Dr. Coxy way, his endless disdain...for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscriminateAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscriminateAndSwitch">surgeons</a></em>.

</li><li> Averted in one episode with Elliot: she just happens to lock her car door at the same time a black guy walks by. She then proceeds to freak out, thinking he mistook her for a racist. Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek">boyfriend</a> asks the guy, who says he just thought she was locking her door.

George spends the episode unsuccessfully trying to prove to his boss that he is not racist. In the end, George is vindicated somewhat when a black guy actually mistakes his boss for Sugar Ray... except that his boss had just left a second ago and didn't hear it.
</li><li> In "The Puerto Rican Day", Kramer accidentally sets fire to a Puerto Rican flag during the Puerto Rican Day parade, and then desperately tries to put it out using the only means currently at his disposal: by stomping on it. A man then spots him violently stomping on a burning flag, and makes the obvious assumption. This unfortunately gets the attention of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gayngster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gayngster">Cedric and Bob</a>. The irony is that Kramer was the only one out of the main cast who was actually having fun at the parade, while everyone else was annoyed that it was holding up traffic and preventing them from going home to watch TV.
</li><li> In "The Cigar Store Indian", Jerry gives Elaine the titular Indian as a gift while she is with a group of her female friends, only to learn that one of the group (who Jerry had a crush on) was Native American. Jerry manages to apologize enough to get a date with her, but ends up continually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiggingYourselfDeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiggingYourselfDeeper">digging himself deeper</a> by unintentionally doing or saying things that seem racist. Ultimately, he approaches a mail carrier, saying "you must know where the Chinese restaurant is", only to realize, too late, that the man is Asian-American, and <em>really</em> doesn't appreciate the implication.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jerry:</strong> You know, I don't get it. Not allowed to ask a Chinese person where the Chinese restaurant is? Aren't we all getting a little too sensitive? I mean, if someone asks me "which way is Israel?", <em>I</em> don't fly off the handle!
</div></li><li> Elaine desperately tries to avoid this trope when she's dating a man who she thinks might be black (darker skin tone, curly hair, apartment decorated with African wood carvings, left South Africa for "obvious reasons"), but could just as easily be white. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">She figures a good compromise is to take him to a bunch of Spanish restaurants</a>.

When they realize that they're just two white people, they decide to go to the Gap.
</li><li> The episode where Elaine's company was critically dependent on a deal with a Japanese conglomerate. Her boss had a terrible cold, forgot his handkerchief on her desk, and sneezed all over his hands. The Japanese businessman mistakes his refusal to shake hands because of germs to be an insult rather than a courtesy. This doesn't make much sense considering that the Japanese tend to prefer bowing over shaking hands.
</li><li> Occurs in an episode where George and Jerry can't get a cab at the airport and pretend to be the people a limo driver is waiting for.

It's even more awkward because Jerry is Jewish and George is half-Jewish (George's mother even refuses to get into a German-made car).

Many viewers interpreted Billy as being racist, due to his particular hatred of Lucas, the only black member of the main gang, particularly when it seems Lucas has a crush on Billy's stepsister Max. Dacre Montgomery, who plays Billy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul">thinks</a> that Billy's actually <a class="urllink" href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stranger-things-star-addresses-characters-possible-racism_us_59f168b5e4b0af27f58996ce">just insecure.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

<ul><li> In "The Midterms" Sam persuades a college friend and Florida DA to run for Congress. Unfortunately, it comes out later that as a DA he often dismissed black jurors from cases he was trying to win. Since this is not an uncommon tactic for DAs, this was still seen as a winnable campaign. Then it was revealed that he belonged to an all-white fraternity in college, which again is neither uncommon or embarrassing, as many frats and sororities have few-to-none black members (especially if the college has a black fraternity that attracts most black pledges). These two circumstances together were enough to staunch the promised support from the White House, as Sam, Josh, and Leo knew the DA was going to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForRacist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForRacist">Mistaken for Racist</a> and didn't want the White House to be as well.
</li><li> In "In Bartlett's Third State of The Union" a (white) Detroit police officer is cited for heroism by the President. It comes out later that the officer was once accused of excessive force, breaking the leg of a (black) suspect. It's evident from the officer's story that the suspect lied (the suspect broke his leg jumping from the building he was robbing) in order to get a several million dollar settlement out of the city. Nevertheless, CJ and Sam have to do damage-control, lest the White House be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForRacist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForRacist">Mistaken for Racist</a>, wondering aloud why they even let him into the State of the Union and persuading the officer to clarify the situation on TV.

<ul><li> Later when they meet with the African leader, who happens to be an old college friend of Jim's, he plays this tactic to unsettle them during negotiations:
<div class="indent"><strong>Jim:</strong> Charlie, long time no see. <br/><strong>Charles:</strong> You don't have to speak pidgin English to me, Jim.

They actually named themselves after Omaha police code for indecent exposure (a friend of the band's was arrested for skinny dipping). People who bought into this rumor were either unaware of or just flat-out ignored the fact that one of the band members is Mexican (which the Klan probably wouldn't take kindly to), not to mention all of the black artists they've worked with.
</li><li> Country artist Brad Paisley and LL Cool J wrote the song "Accidental Racist" centrally about this phenomenon, using the image of Paisley being mistaken for a racist by a black man while wearing a t-shirt with a Confederate flag emblazoned on it, and attempting to collaboratively overcome the US's race problems. Of course, irony of ironies, upon release the song was attacked by numerous critics for its pronounced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> and extremely naive, misguided treatment of its subject matter.
<ul><li> Many critics seemed to think the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> were entirely intentional when it is very apparent to most people that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HanlonsRazor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HanlonsRazor">it was just an awkward fumble</a>, at worst an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBigot">innocent bigotry</a> and more likely just naive oversimplification.

<ul><li> The original cover of Herzeleid featured the band (all Caucasians) standing shirtless in a row - this was taken by critics to be a "poster for the master race." The band eventually changed the North American version of the cover to show just their faces.
</li><li> Added <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">Irony</a>: Some of the band members support communism and the hammer and sickle has shown up more than once in their music videos.
</li><li> The band got so fed up with these accusations, they eventually wrote a song - Links-2-3-4 - in response. The lyrics of the chorus, in part, translate to "My heart beats on the left."
</li></ul></li><li> An odd case is the Danish children's song "Jeg har set en rigtig negermand", where only the first verse is commonly known (It essentially goes: "I have seen a real negro man / His head is as black as a bucket of tar / He said a lot of strange things / And in his nose he had a great big ring"). However, after several more verses in the same vein on the various races, the final verse of the song sees the protagonist call for everyone to be painted blue so that we can all live in a world of harmony and togetherness. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCelebration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCelebration">The Celebration</a></em> saw the first verse being sung, with a party guest telling her (black) partner that it's a racist song. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CableAndDeadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CableAndDeadpool">Cable &amp; Deadpool</a></em> saw a cult called the One World Church to take this premise to its logical conclusion.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TimMinchin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TimMinchin">Tim Minchin</a>'s "Cont" or "Context" has Minchin declare his disdain for minority after minority, only to stop and reveal that he had half the lyrics covered up. He then starts again from the top and incorporates the rest of the lyrics, which provide much-needed context:

He then told of how he was recently given bad service in a branch of Pizza Express because he has a Hitler mustache (which he had because for his stand-up show <em>Hitler Moustache</em>).

One day, she saw a boy in stereotypical Orthodox Jewish attire drinking a carton of juice, and started shouting "Juice! Juice!" at him, while reaching for the carton in a way that could easily be mistaken for a certain kind of salute that was popular in 1930's Germany. The only thing Ross could think to say to alleviate the embarrassment was to tell the boy's horrified family "I'm sorry, she's not actually mine, I'm babysitting for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelGibson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelGibson">Mel Gibson</a>."

At one point he gets up in front of a gathering of men and rants that it's their fault that there's so much crime and violence in the world.

<div class="indent"><strong>Brian:</strong> Where'd you get crack? <br/><strong>Peter:</strong> From blacks. <br/><strong>Brian:</strong> <em>What?!</em> <br/><strong>Peter:</strong> Yeah, right behind Black's Hardware Store. There's a white guy sellin' it.
</div></li><li> In "When You Wish Upon a Weinstein", Peter thinks that being Jewish automatically makes you intelligent (after befriending a stereotypically savvy Jewish financial planner) and takes Chris to get bar mitzvah'ed. When Lois goes to stop them, she talks about how wrong it is, but the people in the synagogue mistakenly think she's a self-hating Jew and chase the Griffins out.
</li><li> In "Deep Throats", Brian gets a job as a cab driver. When he sees Cleveland, he decides against picking him up to buy some milk, causing Cleveland to assume Brian didn't pick him up because he's black. At the end of the episode, Cleveland retaliates by smashing Brian's cab with a golf club.

It's later revealed the dog attack stems from his innate dislike of repairmen, irrespective of ethnicity.
<ul><li> The Church's less-than-subtle approach of conveying that "racism is bad", culminating in a group of churchgoers and the female Priest singing on Hank's lawn with a big cross, points out the hypocrisy of condemning racism yet taking a similar attitude towards those who don't share the same viewpoint.
</li><li> In an early episode, Hank doesn't want to go to his new Laotian neighbor Kahn's barbecue because Kahn had been nothing but rude and insulting to Hank (calling him a "stupid redneck" and so on). Peggy demands that Hank go, otherwise they'll look like racists. Hank is frustrated, "I don't care about his race, he's a jerk. What kind of country is this where you can only hate a man if he's white?"

Unfortunately, due to Toki's revenge meddling, they joined his special "Special Persons Invites Club", and showed up wearing his special club outfits (white robes and hoods), in front of a model of the club logo (a white letter T, for Toki).

After a while, Kwok's parents, the Wongs, politely asked Penny's parents, Oscar and Trudy, that they not allow Penny and Kwok to see each other anymore. While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenUseViolenceWomenUseCommunication" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenUseViolenceWomenUseCommunication">Trudy remained civil in her inquiry, Oscar immediately jumped to conclusions</a>, thinking that the Wongs didn't approve of their son having a relationship with Penny because she wasn't "good enough" for them. This prompted both Oscar and Mr. Wong to imply the other was a racist. It turned out the real reason was that Kwok had an arranged bride, who was coming to town for a visit.

<ul><li> Another sketch has a little boy getting amazed when a black stallion starts talking to him. The stallion, talking in an African-American accent, angrily accuses the boy of assuming he was dumb just because he was black. The boy tries to explain that a horse doesn't normally talk, but this just makes him angrier.

It didn't help that the topic was "People Who Annoy You," and currently the parts he had solved spelled out N_GGERS. Even the black audience members came to the same conclusion. To anyone wondering, the right answer was Naggers. Stan later defends him saying his father isn't racist, just stupid.
</li><li> This trope was played with (somehow) in "There Goes the Neighborhood", where the townsfolk get upset at the town being filled with... rich people (all of whom happen to be black). They try several things that could be seen as racist (burning "lowercase Ts" for "Time to leave", dressing like "ghosts" that more than resemble KKK members), but the "richers" all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangeMindsThinkAlike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangeMindsThinkAlike">see these as exactly what they were intended to be</a>. At the end of the episode, after the rich people have left, Mr. Garrison suggests sell all of the rich people's houses and become rich themselves. When Jimbo and Randy point out that means there would still be rich people in town and they would become what they hate, Mr. Garrison remarks "Well, at least we got rid of those damn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurseCutShort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurseCutShort">ni-" *episode ends*</a>

</li><li> And there's "Chef Goes Nanners" where Chef lobbies to have the town's flag changed, as it depicts four white men hanging a black man. To Chef's indignation, Stan and Kyle claim to not see what the big deal is. He's completely convinced that they're racists... until he realizes that they were so entirely <em>not</em> racist that they didn't think of the men on the flag as four white men hanging a black man, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent">but merely as four men hanging another man</a>. Jimbo and Ned, who aren't racist but are against having the flag changed for the sake of preserving history, sneak into a KKK meeting disguised as Klan members <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedAssistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedAssistance">in order to convince them to switch sides</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltByAssociation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltByAssociation">since they know nobody will vote for whichever side the KKK supports</a> (in fact that's the argument they used, and the KKK agreed with them).

Star assumes that they, like most other Mewmans, hate monsters and that is the reason for their disapproval. She's immediately proven wrong when Princess Penelope's monster boyfriend shows up and is welcomed warmly by her parents. As it turns out their problem wasn't with monsters; all of the stuff Star had shown them was associated with Globgor, who, among various other atrocities, apparently ate Shastacan, Queen Spiderbite's great-uncle several times removed. Star apparently didn't do any research beforehand.

Ironic in the fact that Jacobowitz was Jewish, and his usage of "water buffalo" was a rough translation of the Hebrew "<em>behema</em>", referring to a noisy, rowdy person. The school's official complaint referring to water buffalo as large, black animals that dwell in Africa also hit a major snag when it was pointed out that water buffalo are, in fact, <em>Asian</em>. Nevertheless, other commentators noted that the act of associating Black Americans with animals itself is often used as a racist trope.

Howard resigned from his job because of this but later took another job in the administration. The incident led to something of a clash of beleaguered minorities, as Howard happened to be gay and his resignation (widely believed to be forced) was roundly protested by gay-rights activists. Howard's boss, then-mayor Anthony Williams, later conceded that he'd "acted too hastily" in accepting Howard's resignation.

However, the phrase, "burakkufuraidē bandoru" is in fact correct Japanese ("ブラックフライデーバンドル") for "Black Friday Bundle." If anything, the way it's pronounced in the episode is due to Americans mangling the pronunciation of a Japanese phrase, not vice versa.

</li><li> More than one prominent politician, including former presidential candidates John Kerry, John McCain, and Mitt Romney, has been accused of racism for using the phrase "tar baby". Many assumed it was a racist slur; in actuality, it refers to a problem that only gets worse the more heavily you get involved in it (the original reference came from the Uncle Remus stories).

</li><li> A local TV news program once investigated an Australian man who'd apparently called a real estate ad that said "No Asians" into a local newspaper.

According to Zack's actor Walter Jones, he was originally going to be the Blue Ranger but the producers decided to shift him to Black for continuity with the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a> footage<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3snei');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3snei" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3snei');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Zack was supposed to be Red Ranger Jason's best friend, and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyoryuSentaiZyuranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyoryuSentaiZyuranger">Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger</a></em> the Red and Black Rangers were the closest members of the team</span>, which Jones okayed because he thought the Black costume looked cooler. As for Trini, she was played by a Hispanic actress in the pilot episode, but was recast after demanding more money. Nobody on the staff realized the implications of the casting until after several episodes had been filmed, at which point it was too late to do anything about it.
<ul><li> And irony of ironies, this uproar has since lead to a greater case of racism: a male Native American can never lead a Power Ranger team because he would be a "red man" because the Red Ranger generally leads the team and the one exception was a <em>White</em> Ranger which would be worse. The White Ranger (who was also the Red Ranger for two later power sets) was a Native American character played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonDavidFrank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonDavidFrank">a white actor</a>; oddly enough this went largely unremarked at the time.
</li></ul></li><li> In American Gun culture, you might hear the words "tranny" and "postie" pop up during a conversation. While both of these can be used as transphobic slurs, here they refer to <strong>trans</strong>ferable machine guns and non-transferable (which were all made <strong>post</strong>-1986) machine guns.
<ul><li> Tranny can also be used with car enthusiasts too, referring to the transmission.
</li></ul></li><li> The undercut, a hairstyle that has the hair buzzed on the sides but left long on top, became popular among young men in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>. It also became popular among white nationalists, most notably by Richard Spencer, because it looked less threatening than the "skinhead" look. In response to this, users on dating apps like Tinder began <a class="urllink" href="https://horace.co/en/howtos/why-undercut-alt-right">rejecting any guy who had this hairstyle<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The hairstyle started to fall out of favor as men who weren't white nationalists tried to avoid this trope. (Only applies in America and England though. It does not seem to carry any political implications in Francophone countries.)
</li><li> In November 2018, a white general manager of a St. Paul, Minnesota, Chipotle restaurant was recorded by a group of several young African American people saying that the group needed to pay for their food before ordering it claiming that they never have any money on them. The group posted the video on social media, accusing her of racial discrimination, and led to her getting fired by Chipotle, and the company issued an apology to the group. Sympathizers, wanting to support the group, combed over the leader's Twitter feed and discovered that he and his <a class="urllink" href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tanyachen/chipotle-rehired-fired-manager-customers-accused-racism">friends had been bragging about how they managed to pull a number of "dine dashes" across the city,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and surmised that the manager meant that she was preventing them from pulling another dine and dash on her restaurant.
</li><li> Criticizing Islam often ends in accusations of racism, it does not help that Islam is linked exclusively with Arabs and the people of the Middle East in general, even though not all Arabs are Muslims or all Muslims are Arabs. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-2524-im-liberal-ex-muslim-this-my-life.html">This article by Cracked<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> -written by a liberal ex-Muslim- explains in detail how valid criticism of Islam is often-erroneously or intentionally-branded as racist, and at the same time valid criticism of Islam is hijacked and distorted by racist groups. On the other hand, the stereotypical association of Muslims with turbans has led to a rise of Sikhs getting discriminated against and even attacked.
</li><li> A similar situation exists with linking any criticism of Israel, no matter what the substance of it, to being racist against Jews. In extreme cases this can extend to being at all sympathetic to Palestinians.
</li><li> Actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TyreseGibson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TyreseGibson">Tyrese Gibson</a> (who is black) was once asked by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BET" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BET">BET</a> reporter whether his ongoing — and rather angry — feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesFranco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesFranco">James Franco</a> (who is white) had anything to do with the fact that he (Gibson) was black and Franco was white. The way the question was phrased made it clear that the reporter believed that the argument was somehow based in racism on Franco's part. Gibson quickly ended that assumption by saying, "My beef with him has absolutely nothing to do racism, because he's absolutely not a racist. But it does have everything to do with his being an gigantic asshole. 'Cause that's what he is, a gigantic asshole."
</li><li> The use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonNaziSwastika" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonNaziSwastika">by non-nazi swastikas</a> can cause this.
