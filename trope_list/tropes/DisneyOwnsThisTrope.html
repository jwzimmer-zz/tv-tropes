They typically consist of a name, word, phrase, logo, or combination of the four, and are distinctly associated with their brand. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Trademark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Trademark">the article on the subject</a> for an in-depth explanation.
</p><p>Trademarks belong to a category called "intellectual property rights", alongside similar concepts called copyrights and patents. A full discussion of their definitions and purpose is beyond the scope of this entry (we have a separate comprehensive article explaining how trademarks works, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Trademark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Trademark">click here for details</a>), but the three terms all bear a common theme: They acknowledge creation or ownership of <em>something</em> and provide the owner with some control over how it gets used. If somebody else attempts to use it commercially without the owner's permission (often with an exchange of money involved for such permission), the owner can take them to court and sue for damages.

These laws are also what (ostensibly) protect independent artists, inventors, and writers from having their work stolen or destroyed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilInc">Evil, Inc.</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, severely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom">Misaimed Fandom</a>, or having the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialNumbersFiledOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialNumbersFiledOff">Serial Numbers Filed Off</a>.
</p><p>But there are no such limitations or ethical quandaries in fiction! Some corporations (for example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega-Corp</a>) are <em>so</em> damn powerful and wield <em>so</em> much influence that they can put a stamp of ownership on literally <em>anything</em>. The grass in your front yard? Patented by a gardening company. The morning sunrise? Copyrighted. The name of your favorite pet? A bright sunny day? The word "the"? Yes, them too. If it exists, then somebody, somewhere, has stamped a copyright or trademark upon it, regardless of common sense or reason, and they'll happily send out their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmyOfLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmyOfLawyers">Army of Lawyers</a> to collect royalties at even the slightest hint of infringement.

<p></p><ul><li> The Swedish comic character <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ArneAnka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ArneAnka">Arne Anka</a></em> (Arne Duck), a cartoon duck with a fondness for drinking, sex, classic literature, and rants about politics, wasn't popular with the lawyers of Disney, who decided to sue his creator Charlie Christensen. At first, Christensen fruitlessly tried to use logical reasoning, saying "surely Disney don't hold the right to <em>all</em> cartoon ducks?" but then solved the problem by changing the look of Arne, particularly the beak. Arne kept that look for a few pages, but then he bought and put on a toy duck beak. That way, whenever Disney's lawyers complained, Christensen could point out that Arne wasn't really a duck, the toy beak just made him look like one.
</li><li> Disney tried the same routine on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HowardTheDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HowardTheDuck">Howard the Duck</a> — and succeeded, giving <em>Disney</em> the right to redesign Howard until they no longer considered him infringing. Their design was so horrible that Marvel stopped using the character; much later, when a new Howard the Duck comic appeared on the Marvel MAX imprint, Howard was turned into a giant rat to avoid the problem entirely<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note02izl');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note02izl" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note02izl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">though making him a rodent instead of a duck was either a Take That or a spectacular case of Not Thinking It Through</span>. Now that Disney actually <em>owns</em> Howard, he's finally <a class="urllink" href="http://www.newsarama.com/22800-marvel-s-howard-the-duck-to-get-new-ongoing-series.html">back to being a duck again<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWonderfulWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWonderfulWizardOfOz">Oz</a></em> movie, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OzTheGreatAndPowerful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OzTheGreatAndPowerful">Oz the Great and Powerful</a></em> ran into this, because Warner Bros. owns the rights to the 1939 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">The Wizard of Oz</a></em> film, which Disney's film was most trying to emulate (the <em>Oz</em> books are in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicDomain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicDomain">Public Domain</a>). Disney and Warner Bros. held constant meetings through the development of the film, just to make sure that the sets weren't too similar or that the Wicked Witch's skin color was only a slightly different shade of green.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Universal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Universal">Universal</a> ran into this with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SnowWhiteAndTheHuntsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SnowWhiteAndTheHuntsman">Snow White and the Huntsman</a></em>, based on the fairy tale, "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." At a <em>ComicCon</em> panel with the director, he stated that they got into trouble with Disney over it, and so their movie has to have <em>eight</em> dwarfs. Since the Brothers Grimm's version of the fairy tale (first printed in 1812) already has seven dwarfs, the only way you could run into trouble with the dwarfs would be by making them look too similar to Disney's version or giving them the same names. More likely, the director was joking.
</li><li> Disney has attempted to copyright characters such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland">Alice</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a> in New Zealand. It doesn't help that the rights are in various states of public domain and still in copyright in different parts of the world.
<ul><li> Peter Pan in particular is a very special case in the UK, where a special bill put it in a state of partial copyright in perpetuity. The rights holder (a children's hospital) doesn't have the right to forbid the use of the character, but they <em>do</em> have the right to collect royalties from any work that uses the character in the UK.
</li><li> Disney even tried to trademark "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tarzan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tarzan">Tarzan</a>" in a few countries. The estate of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarRiceBurroughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarRiceBurroughs">Edgar Rice Burroughs</a>, which co-owns the film's copyright and fully owns the character, beat them to it.
</li></ul></li><li> Disney tried to stop the release of a 1986 Filmation animated film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinocchioAndTheEmperorOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinocchioAndTheEmperorOfTheNight">Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night</a></em> and Fox's animated series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPanAndThePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPanAndThePirates">Peter Pan &amp; the Pirates</a></em>, claiming Pinocchio and Peter Pan as intellectual properties. Understandable for the former, since Filmation came clean that their <em>Pinocchio</em> was indeed intended as an unofficial sequel to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pinocchio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pinocchio">the Disney version</a>, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAdventuresOfPinocchio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAdventuresOfPinocchio">the original literary work</a>. Nevertheless, when Disney subsequently sued Filmation for copyright infringement, but they lost the suit as the original <em>Pinocchio</em> story was written by Carlo Collodi and is in the public domain. <em>Peter Pan and the Pirates</em>, however, was based off the original books.
</li><li> In the aftermath of the killing of Osama bin Laden, Disney attempted to trademark "Seal Team 6" in the hopes of making an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em>-style television show based on the team for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC">ABC</a>. They ended up withdrawing their trademark request a short while later, and nothing ever came of the show itself.
</li><li> Disney ran into this themselves when trying to release <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAdventuresOfSharkboyAndLavagirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAdventuresOfSharkboyAndLavagirl">The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl</a></em>. Turns out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a>\<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a> talent had already trademarked "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SharkBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SharkBoy">Shark Boy</a>". Eventually, some kind of settlement was reached because the movie still came out. Good luck finding any Sharkboy wrestling videos on a Google search.

Later, they released Re-Micks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">which uses deadmau5's own signature song without his permission.</a> They ended up settling the case <a class="urllink" href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/deadmau5-disney-settle-dispute-mouse-804072?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+thr%2Fnews+%28The+Hollywood+Reporter+-+Top+Stories%29">out-of-court<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> In 2013, Disney announced that they were planning to trademark the phrase "Dia de los muertos" (Day of the Dead, a well-known holiday in Mexico) for marketing purposes related to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coco">Coco</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar">Pixar</a> film based on said holiday. The Latino community had a bit of an uproar about this, among them Mexican-American cartoonist Lalo Alcaraz, who drew a poster of a giant skeletal Mickey with the caption "It's coming to trademark your cultura". A week later, Disney decided not to go through with the trademarking, which they said was <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_(2017_film)">"intended to protect any potential title for our film and related activities"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. (Alcaraz was then asked to consult on the film.)
</li><li> This is slightly exaggerated reaching the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tradesnark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tradesnark">Tradesnark</a> during the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> event of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyRecordKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyRecordKeeper">Final Fantasy Record Keeper</a></em>: anything even <em>remotely</em> related to <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> displays a (C) Disney somewhere—because <em>Disney</em> owns <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>, not Square Enix.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1brwt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1brwt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1brwt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">While the <em>Final Fantasy</em> and <em>The World Ends With You</em> characters featured in <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> are obviously still property of Square Enix, everything else is property of Disney—including <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> original characters like protagonist Sora.
</span></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uniracers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uniracers">Uniracers</a></em> fell prey to this. Shortly after its release, Pixar sued Nintendo over the game's protagonist bearing a little too much of a resemblance to the protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PixarShorts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PixarShorts">Red's Dream</a></em> and won based on the logic that because Pixar made the first digital work about a red unicycle Pixar owns <em>all</em> digital red unicycles, which is why you don't hear very much, if anything, about the game today. It didn't even get to be rereleased for the Virtual Console or SNES Classic Edition. The fact that Pixar has since been purchased by Disney, which is notorious for bad relations with Nintendo over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuperMarioBros">a failed adaptation of one of its videogames</a>, hasn't helped its chances, either.

This one, featuring a mixture of live-action and Lou Bunin's stop motion puppetry, bore no resemblance to Disney's version. However, sensing competition, the company set out to crush its perceived rival's chances of success. There was a lengthy court battle, during which Disney claimed to own the rights to the <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em> book; as it was and still is in the public domain, that was clearly untrue. Ultimately the case was thrown out, but due to Disney's influence, Bunin's film was not widely shown in theaters and ended up fading into obscurity.
</li><li> In 1950, Estela Films released an animated, musical, feature-length film based on the Cinderella story. The film had the misfortune of coming out the same year as the Disney film and, unfortunately, Disney, trademarked the Spanish name of the story, causing the film to be called <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EraseUnaVez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EraseUnaVez">Erase Una Vez</a>, or "Once Upon A Time," instead of "La Cenicienta," as intended. If that wasn't bad enough, the film was deemed politically permeated, especially after it came to light that there were plans to produce a Catalan dub. One poster made light of this, decorating the frame with Cinderella's name in various languages, including the Catalan "Ventafocs."
</li><li> Mattel might have gotten into trouble because of this when they attempted to adapt more fairy tales into their Barbie film series. A Barbie film adapting the Sleeping Beauty ballet is believed to have been cancelled due to Disney's "Princess Aurora" trademark, despite the proposed film allegedly naming the heroine Clarette.

Fitting since Terry Bolea started using the name Hulk after appearing on a radio show with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LouFerrigno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LouFerrigno">Lou Ferrigno</a> and the host noted that Terry was "bigger than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">The Hulk</a>." (In 2007, Hogan got the trademark rights to his own ring name and associated names, which are now owned by his own Hogan Holdings Ltd)

Some examples include the idea of a Sonic multiverse, as well as evil Sonics in general. Given his aforementioned victory, this intimidated Archie enough to skim around a Sonic multiverse when the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheHedgehogMegaManWorldsUnite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheHedgehogMegaManWorldsUnite">Worlds Unite</a></em> crossover event was released, instead opting for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveMultiplayerCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveMultiplayerCrossover">a more expensive</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">solution</a>.

</li><li> Shortly after Disney bought Marvel in 2009, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby">Jack Kirby</a>s four children countersued Marvel to try to win back some of his intellectual property. They would eventually settle the main case out of court for undisclosed monetary terms just days before the Supreme Court was set to hear the case in 2014. They are assumed to have been the "winners" since they were the ones being sued in the first place and due to the last minute nature of the settlement. In all likelihood, Disney just bit the bullet and gave them a settlement to avoid a potential ruling that could cause the entire entertainment to spiral into chaos. They did "win" the credit part as his name is now on any Marvel project (starting with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok">Thor: Ragnarok</a></em>) that even remotely was inspired by his work. There is still some ongoing litigation however.
</li><li> After having the Golden Age superhero of the same name make an appearance in the 1980s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllStarSquadron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllStarSquadron">All-Star Squadron</a></em> title, DC Comics attempted to trademark "Uncle Sam." They withdrew their claim when informed that the rights to the character "Uncle Sam" in every possible incarnation is owned by the US Government, and thus by law is free to use by anyone in the US for any purpose at all.
</li><li> When two sisters from Australia formed a band called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheVeronicas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheVeronicas">The Veronicas</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArchieComics">Archie Comics</a> came after them because they thought they had named themselves after Veronica Lodge, one of their characters, though the girls asserted that they named themselves after a character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Heathers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Heathers">Heathers</a></em>. This lead them to cross-promote their music through Archie Comics, even appearing in a few comics themselves.
<ul><li> Archie Comics also came after a punk band called Jughead's Revenge, who were sent a letter from the company about their name (not just because of supposed copyright infringement, but because the higher-ups thought their music was inappropriate for the young people who read the comics featuring Jughead, the letter can be found here <a class="urllink" href="https://www.punknews.org/article/470/jugheads-resolution-from-archie-comics)">https://www.punknews.org/article/470/jugheads-resolution-from-archie-comics)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

<ul><li> For several decades, iconic evil organization SPECTRE, along with the organization's equally iconic leader, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, could not be used as villains in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a> films due to a successful series of lawsuits filed against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlbertRBroccoli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlbertRBroccoli">EON Productions</a> by Kevin McClory over the rights to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thunderball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thunderball">Thunderball</a></em> and plot elements introduced in the story. In the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForYourEyesOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForYourEyesOnly">For Your Eyes Only</a></em>, Blofeld (and SPECTRE by association), here an unnamed bald guy with a cat, is rather summarily bumped off for good before the opening credits, likely a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> to the property owner. However, in 2013, MGM and the McClory estate reached a settlement, with Danjaq (the parent company of EON) and MGM buying full rights to SPECTRE and Blofeld. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre">A movie followed suit.</a>

First, he prevented Fox from signing Moe, Larry, and Shemp to a motion picture contract because he knew the contract would cut him out. Then, when they left him and started performing by themselves, Healy tried to stop them on a copyright basis. When all else failed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadBomber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadBomber">Healy allegedly resorted to terror threats against theatres that were thinking about booking their act</a>, which almost led to Shemp leaving the group.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MalcolmX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MalcolmX">Malcolm X</a></em> came out Warner Bros. was dismayed to learn that they couldn't trademark the letter "X", so a lot of merchandise was produced without anyone having to pay them royalties.
</li><li> While pretty much every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> character has been considered for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> at some point, several characters have had to jump through legal hurdles due to different studios owning the movie rights to said characters. Notably, popular characters such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a> were originally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExiledFromContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExiledFromContinuity">Exiled from Continuity</a> due to the rights for the former belonging to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sony">Sony</a> and the latter two belonging to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TwentiethCenturyFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TwentiethCenturyFox">20th Century Fox</a>. Marvel and Sony have since come to a deal regarding Spider-Man (Marvel Studios is given creative rights to MCU-based Spider-Man movies with Sony having distribution rights), and Disney's purchase of Fox may lead to appearances by the other hero teams.
</li><li> This is why MGM split with Warner Bros. at the end of the 20th century, ending their home media distribution contract early. Specifically, they worried that Warner Bros. would claim the rights to media companies that they purchased during the period of the contract, including Orion Pictures, Epic Productions, and the pre-1996 PolyGram library.

Apparently Pratchett's publishers worried about this scene and about the possibility of a visit from the most evil Nazgul known to fantasy fiction, The Lawyers Of The Estate Of JRR Tolkien.

Since there are very few of those facts available, the trait the Estate tends to sue people over is Holmes having <em>emotions</em>.

However, the song's history significantly predated this particular publication; the song itself was based on the melody of "Good Morning to All", which was first published in 1893. A publication of the lyrics and music in 1922 did not contain a copyright notice as required by U.S. law at the time (nowadays, the U.S. is part of the Berne Convention, which makes copyright automatic upon publication).

<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">the mid-Eighties,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamsElectronics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamsElectronics">Williams Electronics</a> began securing trademarks on various aspects of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball">Pinball</a> games in an effort to stymie their competitors, who simply resorted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingAroundTrademarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingAroundTrademarks">Writing Around Trademarks</a> instead. These have since fallen into general use now that Williams is no longer in the pinball business. A few examples:
<ul><li> Williams trademarked "Multiball" around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> to make it so only they could make pinball games with the feature. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DataEast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DataEast">Data East</a> came up with "Tri-Ball" (3-ball multiball) and "M-Ball" (6-ball multiball), Williams realized their plan wouldn't work, and decided to license out the term instead. By the time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega">Sega</a> released <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/Apollo13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/Apollo13">Apollo 13</a>,</em> they proudly promoted it as the first game with "<strong>13-Ball</strong> Multiball!".
</li><li> Similarly, "kickback" (an automatic launcher that, when activated, kicks the ball back into play instead of draining) was called "Laser Kick" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DataEast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DataEast">Data East</a>, while the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProPinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProPinball">Pro Pinball</a></em> series called it "ball rescue".
</li><li> "Bumpers" has long been generic, but Wlliams used both "thumper bumpers" and "jet bumpers," while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Gottlieb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Gottlieb">Gottlieb</a> had "percussion bumpers" and "pop bumpers," and Genco used "power bumpers."
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MidwayGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MidwayGames">Bally's</a> advertisements for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/TheAddamsFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/TheAddamsFamily">The Addams Family</a></em> boasted that 49 patents were made specifically for the machine. Like with Williams, they have also since expired as they have not been renewed, allowing other companies to use those mechanisms. That being said, some of them were not very well-liked, like the pulsating magnets throwing the ball in random directions, so no one else wanted to use them anyway.
</li><li> The tilt sensor is a device that detects when the machine has been jostled or lifted too much by the player, giving the player the now famous TILT penalty. In the form of a metal pendulum surrounded by a metal ring (when the pendulum touches the ring, they complete an electrical circuit), the tilt sensor has remained unchanged for 90 years. Why do pinball companies continue to use this mechanism when accelerometers can do the job, but more accurately, with greater customizability, and arguably for less cost? Because accelerometer-based tilt sensors were patented by a troll, and the industry-wide agreement is to continue to use the pendulum mechanism and let this patent expire than to pay money to the troll and encourage more of this behavior.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigVanVader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigVanVader">Big Van Vader</a> wrestled as "Super Vader" in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UniversalWrestlingFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UniversalWrestlingFederation">Universal Wrestling Federation</a> due to Big Van Vader being a gimmick <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling">New Japan Pro-Wrestling</a> had Go Nagai himself work on and them not wanting it used by their direct competition.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">World Wrestling Entertainment</a> has fallen afoul of trademarks twice:
<ul><li> For a short while, it looked like the company couldn't use the wrestler <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DavidHeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DavidHeath">Gangrel</a> in its game properties, because Gangrel was a registered trademark of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhiteWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhiteWolf">White Wolf</a> (as a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a></em> clan name). They were able to iron that particular problem out and get Gangrel into games.
</li><li> The more famous one was having to change its company name to World Wrestling Entertainment (and its logo to WW) due to a violation of an agreement with the World Wildlife Fund concerning the international use of the WWF acronym.
</li><li> On the flip side: the company aggressively defends any trademarks it owns, when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AmericanWrestlingAssociation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AmericanWrestlingAssociation">American Wrestling Association</a> went under, former employees got together and started using and selling the AWA to upstart companies, till WWE torpedoed this budding revival.
</li><li> WWE often trademarks wrestler names  which explains why performers who leave WWE often have to use new names. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheDudleyBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheDudleyBoys">The Dudley Boys</a>, for example, had to become "Team 3D" when the pair left WWE for TNA, despite being The Dudleys before WWE because WWE bought ECW, where The Dudley gimmick started, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">that supposedly qualified for not using it before WWE</a>).
</li><li> Jay Reso, better known as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Christian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Christian">Christian</a>" in WWE, beat the company on this one by trademarking "Christian Cage" to ensure that he could use his "WWE name" when he jumped ship to TNA.
</li><li> Ever since the mid-to-late '00s it seems that WWE has taken their policy a step further by making all newcomers use a WWE-given name, even those who previously wrestled under their real names or own their own names. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting">Sting</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamoaJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamoaJoe">Samoa Joe</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles">AJ Styles</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AustinAries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AustinAries">Austin Aries</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShinsukeNakamura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShinsukeNakamura">Shinsuke Nakamura</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobbyRoode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobbyRoode">Bobby Roode</a> have all managed to evade this rule.
</li></ul></li><li> This complaint has been thrown at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AAA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AAA">AAA</a>, not only for not allowing popular wrestlers like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LaParka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LaParka">La Parka</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Psicosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Psicosis">Psicosis</a> to use their gimmicks away from the promotion but then giving those gimmicks to new wrestlers who then were allowed to use the gimmicks on the independent and foreign circuits with AAA's blessing.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMLL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMLL">CMLL</a> forced a wrestler known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Hunico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Hunico">Mistico</a> to abandon his gimmick since they had their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Mistico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Mistico">Místico</a>. Then CMLL left <em>that</em> Mistico in search of a new gimmick when he left them and they not only duplicated it with yet another wrestler but also transferred over his entire "Super Sky Team" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerStable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerStable">stable</a>. Ironically, CMLL couldn't or didn't care to block usage of "Los Reyes Del Aire", the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nickname</a> for Super Sky Team taken after recurring a CMLL event that Myzteziz would name a new tag team of his after.

Thankfully for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft">Blizzard</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens">James Cameron</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ASpaceMarineIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ASpaceMarineIsYou">others</a> they were unsuccessful. However, in that case, the estates of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers">Robert Heinlein</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman">Edward Elmer Smith</a> and Bob Olsen (who coined the term in his novel "Captain Brink of the Space Marines" [1932]) would overturn Games Workshop in this.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Battletech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Battletech">Battletech</a></em> was originally named <em>Battledroids</em>. What happened next is a bit of conjecture, but either story hinges in the fact that LucasFilm has registered a trademark to the word "droid":
<ul><li> One story claims that FASA voluntarily decided to change the name in the hopes of sweetening the pot in negotiations with LucasFilm for a license to make a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> roleplaying game (to complement their well-received <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> licenses)
</li><li> The other story is that Lucasfilm sent a C&amp;D, forcing a change to the more recognizable name.
</li><li> FASA in either case did not get the hoped for <em>Star Wars</em> license (that going instead to <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WestEndGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WestEndGames">West End Games</a>),and would would be hit <em>hard</em> with this trope about 12 years later after a dispute over the Unseen that <em>as of 2017</em> is <em>still</em> ongoing.

There was to be a fantasy sequence in which Loner (Dylan Klebold) fantasizes about acting out the haymow scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SpringAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SpringAwakening">Spring Awakening</a></em> with Rebel. In the original play which is in public domain, Melchior actually rapes Wendla - but the idea of the scene was that he was fantasizing about kissing and holding her consensually. Problem was, the musical Spring Awakening that was in off-Broadway production at the time (2004) already featured Melchior and Wendla having consensual sex. The scene was replaced with him helping Rebel act out the lines for Romeo and Juliet.

<ul><li> Averted with Lego bricks. The patent for the bricks expired long ago, and Lego has so far been unsuccessful in their efforts to trademark their iconic 2x4 brick, hence why you'll find very similar brands of construction sets like Mega Bloks on the market. Hasn't stopped Lego from trying to take legal action against them time and time again, though. And this despite the fact that they themselves got into hot water due to being similar to Kiddicraft play bricks, which they settled out of court on.

<ul><li> Sega also owns a patent on using an on-screen arrow to tell the player which direction to go (and it was valid enough to sue the makers of <em>The Simpsons: Road Rage</em> and get them to settle). Apparently they think they invented the road sign in 1999. → Look at us, we're violating a patent! ←
</li><li> In 2009 and 2011, Sega was awarded two more patents on the use of tap and drag-and-drop controls on a touchscreen to move characters around; i.e., using a touchscreen <em>as a touchscreen!</em> That's right, Sega owns drag-and-drop. Which they seem to think they invented in their famous game, Windows 3. They even filed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit">Frivolous Lawsuit</a> against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Level5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Level5">Level-5</a> in 2012 for 900 million yen (US$11 million) claiming that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InazumaEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InazumaEleven">Inazuma Eleven</a></em> infringes these patents, despite the fact that <em>Inazuma Eleven</em> was released in 2008.
</li><li> According to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikePollock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikePollock">Mike Pollock</a></em>, SEGA <em>somehow</em> owns the rights to his Eggman voice.
</li><li> Sega originally tried to patent multiple view angles in <em>Virtua Racing</em>, which held water for awhile but eventually invalidated when Nintendo pointed out that it had been done in <em>Star Wars: Attack on the Death Star</em>.
</li><li> Sega claims that they still hold the patent for real-time view angle change as seen in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DaytonaUSA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DaytonaUSA">Daytona USA</a> tho.

Thankfully, most people don't care much for the feature and some even found the real-time view angle changes <em>nauseating</em>.

Weirdly, the same change wasn't made for the later Virtual Console release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em>.
<ul><li> Also done in the VC re-release for <em>Zoda's Revenge</em>. "Tetrads" were changed to "blocks", and "Tetris" was changed to "Puzzle".
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tetris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tetris">Tetris</a> Company has not only trademarked the name "Tetris", but they have also trademarked the Tetromino shapes and the theme song, and Henk Rogers will send cease-and-desist letters to anyone who dares to so much as make a game with falling tetrominoes. TTC has gone so far as to claim infringement on elements of the game which cannot be copyrighted (as ruled by the US Supreme Court in <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_v._Borland">Lotus v. Borland<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>).
<ul><li> The song is actually <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korobeiniki">a Russian folk song<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that is firmly in the public domain with respect to <em>copyright</em>, but because it has built up a secondary meaning, it's a <em>trademark</em> within video games.
</li><li> On top of <em>Lotus v. Borland</em>, Lego already tried to copyright/"trademark" a patent leading to the Supreme Court decision "Trademark law should not be used to perpetuate monopoly rights enjoyed under now-expired patents." With enough money to cover the legal costs, a large company making a profitable Tetris clone would theoretically be able to easily defeat The Tetris Company in court (except for the music). It's just that without the Tetris name, it's hard to make a lot of money selling a Tetris-like game, so no one has bothered.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">Nintendo</a>:
<ul><li> Nintendo owns the use of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityMeter">Sanity Meter</a> in video games. They patented it when they made <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalDarkness">Eternal Darkness</a></em>. (Well, more specifically, what they patented was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">when it goes down</a>).
</li><li> Nintendo also patented the D-Pad in the form of a cross-shaped button. This is the reason why all of SEGA's and Microsoft's systems had circular D-pads and the PlayStations have four buttons arranged in a cross in their place. However, the patent expired in the mid-2000s, thus the Xbox One controller has a proper D-pad.
</li><li> Nintendo trademarked the phrase "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisMeansWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisMeansWar">It's On Like Donkey Kong</a>", as well as several sounds from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> (including coins, mushrooms, and pipes) in the mid-2010s.
</li><li> The subsidiary company <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IntelligentSystems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IntelligentSystems">Intelligent Systems</a> has trademarked the term Pegasus Knight, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterClass">Character Class</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a> series, due to it being one of the most popular classes in the series.
</li></ul></li><li> If you were waiting on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadingScreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadingScreen">Loading Screen</a> of a game made between 1995 and 2015 and wondered why there wasn't a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniGame">Mini-Game</a> to play while you wait, it was due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BandaiNamcoEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BandaiNamcoEntertainment">Namco</a>; they had a patent on that which lasted during that period, until the patent finally ended in 2015, despite the concept coming from old tape loader games on the C64.
</li><li> Mojang AB, creators of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em>, have been involved with a <a class="urllink" href="http://kotaku.com/5847295/mojang-v-bethesda-part-2-the-attorneys-and-notch--pete-weigh-in">trademark dispute<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with Zenimax Media, the parent company of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bethesda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bethesda">Bethesda Softworks</a>, creators of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em> series, over Mojang's attempt to trademark the use of the word "scrolls" in the title of <em>Scrolls</em> (and related merchandise). Bethesda claimed that doing so would infringe on their <em>Elder Scrolls</em> trademark. Both sides were essentially attempting to play this trope trope straight in their favor. (The case would be settled, allowing <em>Scrolls</em> to use the word in its title, but not in any sequels or spin-offs. However, in 2018, Mojang decided to rename <em>Scrolls</em> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallersBane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallersBane">Caller's Bane</a></em>, rendering all previous arguments moot.)
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NCSoft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NCSoft">NC Soft</a>, creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em>, Uncle Sam, a character created in 1826 by the U.S. Government... and by law thusly a <em><strong>public domain</strong></em> character usable by anyone for any purpose, is owned wholly and completely by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a>, and will generic your character if you use the character's image in the game. On the other hand, Marvel sued <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NCSoft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NCSoft">NC Soft</a> just because it was theoretically possible to make characters who looked vaguely like Marvel characters (it was eventually settled out of court), so after that they tended to err on the side of over-zealousness.
</li><li> In 2006, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRedCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRedCross">the Canadian Red Cross</a> issued a press release asking video game makers to stop using the red cross in their games as a first-aid symbols, because it is actually a protected symbol specific to their organization per <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLawsAndCustomsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLawsAndCustomsOfWar">The Laws and Customs of War</a>, and inappropriate use could dilute the protective value of the symbol in various dangerous places. This is why Valentine from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkullGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkullGirls">Skull Girls</a></em> had her costume redesigned after release to change the crosses from red to fuchsia. The "proper" generic symbol for first-aid is a <em>white</em> cross on a green background .
</li><li> The ESRB holds a trademark on all their rating icons, in order to ensure that publishers can't misrepresent the content of their games without submitting them to the rating board. Didn't stop some from trying; the developers of <em>Wartune</em> found this out the hard way when they tried to use the AO ("Adults Only") rating in their Internet ads as part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSells">Sex Sells</a> campaign.
</li><li> In 2014, the developers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CandyCrushSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CandyCrushSaga">Candy Crush Saga</a></em> held exclusive rights to the word "candy" in app titles, and tried to file for rights of the word "saga". They later gave up on the latter (due to them attempting to sue several companies using "saga" in their products, which created quite a backdraft), and gave up the rights for the former a month later as a result.
</li><li> Force feedback (the "rumbling") in controllers is owned by a company called Immersion. Sony had a scuffle with them in 2006 which was why the initial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3">PlayStation 3</a> controllers didn't have the feature.
</li><li> From around 2000 till 2016, with a few special exceptions such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Forza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Forza">Forza</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts">Electronic Arts</a> had exclusive rights to Porsche vehicles, so in most non-EA games, they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">replaced with the RUF brand instead</a>. The exclusive rights were discontinued in 2016, probably due to Dieselgate scandal hits Porsche<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4upz5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4upz5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4upz5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">now part of Volkswagen Group since 2012</span> quite hard.
</li><li> Microsoft owns the concept of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementSystem">Achievements</a> for their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox">Xbox</a> and Windows products. When Sony wanted to implement the system for their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> brand, they got around it with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">Trophies</a>", which is similar in concept but different in design.
</li><li> Sony once attempted to trademark the term "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay">Let's Play</a>". No really. It luckily didn't come to pass, but imagine if it did?
</li><li> A man known as Tim Langdell once sat on the word "edge" as a video game title. He used it enter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit">Frivolous Lawsuit</a> after lawsuit... until he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon">tried it against</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts">Electronic Arts</a> and had the copyright taken from him.
</li><li> Want to open an establishment where people can order drinks and play arcade games? If you do, then you better not call it a Barcade, unless you want a nasty letter from the Brooklyn-based <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcade">Barcade<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> chain, who popularized the concept and are very aggressive in enforcing the trademark on their name.
</li><li> Subverted in the famous video game industry lawsuit that saw <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom">Capcom</a> take Data East to court over <em>Fighter's History</em> and its similiarity to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII">Street Fighter II</a></em> that didn't play out the way Capcom had intended, with the courts weighing in favor of Data East's right to create similar but otherwise distinct products and that things that look alike are not protected under copyright law. This has parallels to the below lawsuit between Apple and Microsoft over interface elements and it's why a game like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand">Rock Band</a></em> can use green, red, yellow, blue, and orange fret buttons on its guitar even though the developers, Harmonix Music Systems, are reusing an interface element from their previous work on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero">Guitar Hero</a></em> (which is owned by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Activision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Activision">Activision</a>).

<ul><li> In late January of 2016, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheFineBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheFineBrothers">The Fine Brothers</a> controversially announced plans for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/React" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/React">React World</a>, a reaction video network that tried to commercially affiliate the genre itself with their own channel by trademarking the term "React" and copyrighting reaction videos, which would give them a cut of the profits on all videos in the "reaction" genre. This led to a massive backlash against them from viewers and other YouTubers for supposedly trying to take control of reaction videos on YouTube, and their subscriber numbers started dropping like flies (losing around 100 a minute because of their decision). On February 2, they repealed their decision, removing the licenses and subsequent Content ID strikes.

<ul><li> Perhaps the best aversion of this trope is any cleaning product by the Swiss company <a class="urllink" href="http://www.roesch-swiss.ch/">Rösch<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which includes such awesome examples as "Linux" detergent, "Micro&amp;Soft" softener, and "Mac Oxi" stain remover. None of them violate a single trademark law, because they're used for cleaning products, not for computer software. Whether they would run into problems in the United States is open to debate; one question that is considered very strongly in trademark infringement cases is "dilution", namely whether the product alleged to be infringing can reasonably be considered to be using it in a way which would lead to confusion between the two different companies or products. This is likely because cleaning products and computers are different enough to be non-infringing.
</li><li> Technology companies in particular are rife with "patent trolls" who own seemingly obvious/general patents and threaten legal action against smaller companies. When they think they have enough balls to do so, they go after bigger ones (and more often than not win). Notable cases where the trolls were defeated (or at least had little success if any):
<ul><li> In 2013, <a class="urllink" href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/01/how-newegg-crushed-the-shopping-cart-patent-and-saved-online-retail/">Soverain Software attempted to sue computer hardware store NewEgg<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> because they owned an "electronic shopping cart" patent. They managed to get Amazon.com, so why not? Except NewEgg fought and brought to light how ridiculously obvious this patent was and won.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/04/meet-the-nice-guy-lawyers-who-want-1000-per-worker-for-using-scanners/">A law firm once represented a company that allegedly had a patent for scanning and saving it electronically<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li></ul></li><li> There have been jokes for years about Apple owning lowercase "i" and Microsoft owning the letter "e".
</li><li> The Canadian government has the camouflage pattern used by the Canadian Forces, called CADPAT (CAnadian Disruptive PATtern), under copyright. U.S. Marine Corps copied the idea and made a similar pattern (MARPAT) for their own use. Both governments have trademarked their patterns and do not allow "official" versions to be sold to the public. There are knockoff patterns commercially available.
<ul><li> One incredibly important distinction is that MARPAT has the Corps' real trademark, the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor in the pattern. Knockoffs do not, like the Army's UCP (Universal Camouflage Pattern), which actually uses the exact same digital pseudo-random pattern, in different colors.
</li></ul></li><li> Indeed, Apple seems to run into this trope a lot:
<ul><li> When the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AppleMacintosh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AppleMacintosh">Macintosh</a> came out in 1984, the ads and manuals had a credit to McIntosh (the people that make amplifiers and such) in them; Apple was later able to claim "Macintosh" as a trademark in itself.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">Apple Corps/Apple Records</a> and Apple had a bit of an argument over their name, but since music and computers were distinct markets, both continued to use the trademark Apple. But when Apple Computer started selling iPod music players and distributing music through their iTunes store, Apple Records took them to court for stepping on their trademark. The Beatles wouldn't appear on iTunes until the settlement nine years later, in which Apple Corps sold their trademarks to Apple, who re-licensed the marks back to Apple Corps.
</li><li> When they introduced the Mighty Mouse, Apple Computer went to the trouble of licensing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MightyMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MightyMouse">the name</a> from CBS even though the device doesn't use the character's likeness at all. Whether or not it would have been legal otherwise is debatable (it'd be hard to confuse a computer mouse for a cartoon mouse), but Apple apparently wanted to play it safe. Unfortunately, a different company had a trademark on Mighty Mouse for computer mice. <a class="urllink" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9949412-7.html">That company sued Apple and CBS in 2008.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<ul><li> For that matter, the first Mighty Mouse cartoon has an ordinary mouse locked in a supermarket, bathing in super soap and eating super cheese, to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Super</a>... no, the hastily renamed Mighty Mouse!
</li></ul></li><li> In 2004, Apple applied for a patent for an interface that would search across multiple databases. This was when Google just searched the Web. Apple's interface would search the Internet and, let's say, your personal address book at the same time. The patent application didn't detail the program design, just what it would do. After being denied nine times, they got it. Apple can now claim that any kind of search engine that searches across different databases is theirs and theirs alone.
</li><li> Not to mention, as many have snarkily done, that the entire basis for many of Apple's iPad-related lawsuits seems to be the fact that the flat black rectangle of glass (literally the most minimal design possible) is patented to them.
</li><li> Funnily enough, <a class="urllink" href="http://info.abril.com.br/noticias/mercado/inpi-confirma-marca-iphone-para-gradiente-13022013-22.shl">Apple DOESN'T have the rights to use the name "iPhone" in Brazil<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The Brazilian company Gradiente registered the name in 2000 when it planned to develop a cell phone with internet access ("internet phone"). Because Apple only wanted to register the name in 2007, the National Institute of Intellectual Property (INPI) decided that Gradiente would have the rights to use it since they asked first. In 2013, Apple and Gradiente agreed to co-own the "iPhone" trademark.
</li><li> Apple also doesn't have the rights to use the name "iPhone" in China, as it is a trademark for leather products there. Apple has been fighting a legal battle with the company that owns this trademark since 2012.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-ipad-design-patent-2012-11">Apple owns the design for oblong-shaped electronic devices with rounded corners<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://gizmodo.com/5950690/apples-latest-slide+to+unlock-patent-basically-prevents-other-phones-from-dragging-anything-around-a-lock-screen">slide to unlock<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (though this one was invalidated in Germany).
</li><li> Back in the '80s, Apple sued Digital Research and Microsoft for implementing GUIs with overlapping windows, claiming that this was a distinguishing feature of the Macintosh. Microsoft actually licensed some elements from Apple for Windows 1.0, but the interpretation of said agreement was very broad (at least according to Microsoft) so they went ahead with overlapping windows in 2.0. The suit ended up being one of the landmark decisions in US copyright law regarding interface patents: Apple claimed that even if in comparison by separate elements Mac and Windows are clearly different, using those elements in a certain combination can recreate the Macintosh "look and feel". The court ruled that "look and feel" can't be patented. In a way, Google's defense of Android was partially built on that lawsuit, meaning Apple was toasted twice on the ordeal.
</li></ul></li><li> Amazon has one of these "concept" patents as well. The <em>idea</em> of One-Click is their property. Although not in the EU where it was deemed too obvious to patent.
<ul><li> They also filed a patent for photos on a white background, as made rather infamous by a segment of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheColbertReport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheColbertReport">The Colbert Report</a></em>. In practice, the patent only applies to an extremely specific photography setup, making it essentially useless.

</li><li> The John Deere company once tried to trademark the distinctive green shade of its tractors, but their application was denied. Mainly because farmers would have lots of green things and they would like all of their equipment to "match" - seriously!

</li><li> It should be noted that colour trademarks are typically restricted only to competing organization. They do <em>not</em> restrict average people from using those colours in their artwork. So go ahead and paint your car "Barbie pink" with "HotWheels blue" polka-dots. Sure, it may garner you plenty of strange looks and chuckles - but it would not get you into any <em>legal</em> trouble.
</li><li> Guitar pickup manufacturer DiMarzio trademarked double cream bobbins on humbucking pickups. This has caused headaches for Gibson because many of their vintage guitars used double cream pickups (which came about from a faulty batch of bobbins that didn't have the black pigment in them) before Dimarzio started manufacturing and selling them in that color. When reissuing those old instruments, such as when they recreated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin">Jimmy Page's #2 Les Paul</a>, they have to use black or zebra pickups instead.

</li><li> Former basketball coach Pat Riley owns the trademark on the word "threepeat", having filed the paperwork when the Los Angeles Lakers had a chance to pull one off. The Lakers didn't get there. Ironically the Chicago Bulls won their first threepeat after beating the Riley-coached New York Knicks in the Conference Finals.
</li><li> After the Bulls' first three, a group of investors trademarked "Quad Squad" at great expense; for them, neither hilarity nor wealth ensued.
</li><li> The New England Patriots attempted to trademark "19-0" prior to Super Bowl XLII, something that the rest of the sporting world refuses to let them live down. In fairness, the preemptive copyrighting was probably necessary, as less than a year earlier, the Colorado Rockies coined the term "Rocktober" and then had to pay a lot to buy the mark from some entrepreneur who jumped on it immediately.
</li><li> Texas A&amp;M has trademarked the phrase "The 12th Man" referring to the home fans at football games. The Seattle Seahawks have a portion of their website dedicated to their "12th MAN", including the "12th MAN Ball", a game ball dedicated to the fans after a crucial win over the New York Giants. The Seahawks clearly state that they use the term under license from Texas A&amp;M.

This especially became a problem after a local business owner created a "Saw 'Em Off" image, which depicted the logo with the horns missing. Nearly ten years passed before UT really caught on (even though they had been wearing it to games). A new logo was introduced with just enough "fixes" to avoid lawsuits.
</li><li> The NFL, claiming to own a trademark of the New Orleans Saints catchphrase "Who Dat?", sent cease-and-desist orders to New Orleans-area shirt vendors selling unofficial "Who Dat?" shirts shortly after the Saints entered the Super Bowl.

Once he trademarked a word or phrase, he immediately launched million-dollar lawsuits against people and companies who were casually using those words. His lawsuits have consistently been laughed out of court.
</li><li> This has brought up much concern for the lawyers of Hasbro, in particular due to their <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> line having tons of characters with descriptive and generic names. For instance, the character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulBrotha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulBrotha">Jazz</a>, who is an Autobot, is now always sold as "Autobot Jazz", because while there are plenty of other places the word "Jazz" could be trademarked, there's virtually no other place where the phrase "Autobot Jazz" could be shoehorned in. Other characters' names had to be changed because someone <em>else</em> had already trademarked them; this is why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot Rod</a> is now referred to as "Rodimus"—yes, someone managed to <em>trademark "hot rod"</em>.
<ul><li> In an amusing bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">irony</a>, Hasbro lost the ability to use "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidAppealCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidAppealCharacter">Bumblebee</a>" during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em>, because they didn't produce a Bumblebee during the series where <em>everyone turned into animals</em>. A bumblebee named Bumblebee would have made even "Cheetor" and "Rhinox" look like clever names, and a heroic insect character wouldn't have fit with their theming anyway (we got the evil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Waspinator</a> instead).
</li><li> Also, Hasbro has to describe Transformers as toys which <em>convert</em>, because if they <em>transform</em> then "transformer" is just a bland <em>description</em>, which cannot be trademarked.
</li><li> Hasbro also threatened to sue humorist Randy Cassingham to stop his sales of "Get Out of Hell Free" cards, claiming they violated intellectual property of the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Monopoly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Monopoly">Monopoly</a>.

Most of them just got another name tagged along with them, such as Lyra "Heartstrings" or Octavia "Melody", but some like Bon Bon (already trademarked by the Hershey Company) or Carrot Top (trademarked by the comedian Scott Thompson) had to be given totally new names.

</li><li> The publishing company holding the trademarks "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix">Asterix</a>" and "Obelix" went to court, forcing the open source project MobiliX to rename to TuxMobil.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarlanEllison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarlanEllison">Harlan Ellison</a> had trademarked his own name.
<ul><li> This is somewhat common for some celebrities — athletes, musicians, NASCAR drivers, and porn stars, particularly. Note though, that trademarks only apply to certain uses of a name—just because Harlan Ellison is trademarked doesn't mean you can't name your child Harlan Ellison. It simply limits the use of the name in certain mediums (types of company titles, mostly).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince">Prince</a> got into trouble with this, when the trademark for his name got assigned to his record label <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBrosRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBrosRecords">Warner (Bros.) Records</a>, with whom he engaged in a high-profile feud throughout the 1990's. To circumvent this issue and give an extra "fuck you" to the big WB, Prince adopted a deliberately-unpronounceable "Love Symbol" as his stage name until the trademark on his real one eventually expired in 2000. Because Prince had this symbol copyrighted, it is ineligible for use in Unicode for as long as his estate maintains ownership; Warner Bros. had to send out floppy disks to the press that contained a special font with the Love Symbol included, and fans would adopt the emoticon "O(+&gt;" as a way to write out the Love Symbol in text form.

</li><li> In 1978, Digital Equipment Corporation came out with the VAX line of mini-computers. In the UK, there was a line of vacuum cleaners named VAX. No problem so far, as the two trademarks didn't clash for reasons explained in the intro. But DEC's competitors had a great deal of fun borrowing the advertising slogans from the vacuum cleaner company, such as "Nothing sucks like a VAX".
</li><li> "Charles Darwin" is a trademark when applied to roses, according to a sign in the Bronx Botanical Garden.
</li><li> Kellogg's successfully sued Exxon/Esso for their use of a tiger mascot, claiming it infringed on Tony the Tiger. Though Exxon could still use the mascot, there are strict limits on how it uses it; all it can do is smile and wave. The issue was "tiger" brand food products sold in Exxon's convenience stores.
</li><li> Kohler, the manufacturer of plumbing products and fixtures has trademarked the names of the colors that their products are stained, and are very picky about their use.
</li><li> Fox News claimed the phrase "Fair and Balanced" and <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_v._Franken">sued now-US Senator Al Franken<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for using the phrase in connection with his book, <em>Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right</em>. In response, Franken joked that he had trademarked the word "funny", and that Fox had infringed his intellectual property rights by characterizing him as "unfunny". The judge deemed Fox's lawsuit "wholly without merit" and Fox thereupon withdrew it before the judge could rule on whether it was even a valid trademark.

Not only had the Metropolitan Police stopped using real police boxes by 1969, but they had never used it as a brand identifier in the required way.
</li><li> While Adobe's trademarks are quite normal, the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.adobe.com/misc/trade.html">guidelines for using them<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, are very specific.
<ul><li> A large part of it is that most "Photoshopping" is actually done using (the cheaper) Paint Shop Pro. The best way to piss off Adobe's lawyers is to say you photoshopped something in Paint.NET, Paint Shop Pro, Pixelmator, etc.or even in <em>Adobe's own Photoshop Elements</em>. Similarly, saying that you Googled something on Yahoo is <a class="urllink" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-you-google.html">"Bad. Very, very bad"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> More likely it's an attempt to prevent their trademarks from being genericized. In fact, it's necessary for the trademark holder to show they're taking such steps, as if a trademark becomes generic enough without any effort to prevent it, that company may no longer be able to keep that trademark.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.little-trees.com/">Car-Freshner Corporation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> ran a full-page ad in a Photoshop magazine about how the "Little Tree" is their logo, even if you recolor it or decorate it in any way.

Dead celebrities whose names get licensed a lot.
<ul><li> Elvis Presley Enterprises not only has his name trademarked, but they also hold a trademark over his likeness. In other words, even if you don't have the clearances to use Elvis' music catalog in your work, you would still have to clear the use of Elvis or a look-alike as a distinct character.
</li><li> The same situation applies with Marilyn Monroe. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamsElectronics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamsElectronics">Williams Electronics</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/Taxi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/Taxi">Taxi</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball">Pinball</a> renamed their Marilyn lookalike to "Lola" and turned her into a brunette to avoid a lawsuit.

</li><li> Harley-Davidson attempted to trademark <em>the sound</em> of their motorcycles revving: "The mark consists of the exhaust sound of applicant's motorcycles, produced by V-twin, common crankpin motorcycle engines when the goods are in use." Nine other motorcycle manufacturers opposed the trademark because they use the same type of common crankpin<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note60lpc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note60lpc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note60lpc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"Common" here is not implying that it's a "common", as in "generic", design, but a type of design wherein both connecting rods overlap, sharing a "common" crankpin by using a fork-and-blade design</span> V-twin engines and thus made the same sound. The courts, recognizing Harley-Davidson's application for a trademark as being what it was (an end-run attempt to put its competition out of business) denied the application.
<ul><li> However there was at one point a trademark on the sound of a Harley-Davidson engine. The application was not based on the design of the motorcycle engine, but the noise as stock sound effect. The holder of the trademark asks for very little in royalties compared to most trademark holders and it seems to only apply in Australia and New Zealand territories.
</li><li> Not all engines (particularly with smaller layouts like the two cylinders in a motorcycle) have perfectly even timing between power strokes. With two cylinders using four-stroke cycles, there should be a power stroke every 360 degrees of crankshaft rotation (720 deg. per cycle divided by 2 cylinders equals 360 degrees). However, Harley's distinctive sound comes from the fact that one cylinder fires, then the second one fires only 270 degrees later, leaving 450 degrees until the first one fires again. So, they are attempting to trademark a mechanical design that they use and no one else does, particularly a design that provides a very distinctive sound.

<ul><li> This makes sense, as neither the visual nor the sound of the Leo's roar are actually accurate depictions of a lion's roar.

<ul><li> For that matter, Intel also trademarked the word "inside". Riverdale potato chips, sold only at Irving gas stations in Atlantic Canada, were abruptly discontinued sometime in the late 1990s/early 2000s because Intel took issue with the slogan on the bag, "Pride Inside".

</li><li> The <em>Columbia Journalism Review</em> and other journalism journals often run ads from major companies (particularly Coca-Cola, Xerox and Johnson and Johnson) imploring reporters and writers to shy away from the use of brand names as generic terms. In this, they <em>do</em>, surprisingly, have a point, as words such as "aspirin", "cellophane", "laundromat", and "escalator", which were originally trademarks, were ruled to have been abandoned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrandNameTakeover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrandNameTakeover">because of their widespread acceptance as generic terms.</a>
</li><li> CBS Corporation (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>) has a registered trademark on the words "USS Enterprise". Never mind the first USS <em>Enterprise</em> was an armed sloop of the U.S. Continental Navy in 1775 and numerous U.S. Navy ships up to the present. Paramount, the previous owners, had tried suing the Navy to keep them from selling items with the words "USS Enterprise" on them.
</li><li> Despair, Inc., publishers of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotivationalPoster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotivationalPoster">Demotivator posters</a>, trademarked the "frowny", :-(, and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.despair.com/demotivators/misfortunate.html">issued a mock press release<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> promising to litigate all those who infringed upon it, even in private emails.
</li><li> A barely known fact: The word "tremolo", for many years, was a trademark of the Fender company (others used the term "vibrato arm" instead). Ironically, the word "tremolo" as used to describe the pitch-changing mechanism on a guitar is incorrect—"tremolo" refers to a variation in <em>volume</em>, not pitch—and so the other companies <em>without</em> the trademark ended up with the use of the correct word.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas">Lucasfilm</a> owns the rights to the word "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Droid</a>." Verizon Wireless had to get permission to use it as the name of the first Droid smartphone released in 2009 by Motorola. Verizon has since released several other Droid models, presumably under the same agreement.

After several months of Universal refusing to officially seek legal proceedings, instead simply trying to get Nintendo to agree to a settlement without litigation, a lawyer working for Nintendo discovered that not only did Universal not own the trademark rights to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKong">King Kong</a></em>, but that they themselves had argued in the past that the character was in the public domain. The court case officially declared in 1984 that the character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong">Donkey Kong</a> could not be confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKong">King Kong</a>, and that while Universal Studios owned the majority of rights (with the remainder being divided between creator Richard Cooper, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RKOPictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RKOPictures">RKO Pictures</a>, and the Dino De Laurentiis company), they did not hold exclusive rights to the name and character as they had claimed.

That said, part of Universal's desire in all this was to have a top-notch video game company to make licensed games for their films. After failing to get Nintendo, Universal bought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LJNToys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LJNToys">LJN Toys</a>: a company most well-known through the numerous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd">The Angry Video Game Nerd</a> videos covering their horrid video game library. On a side note, Nintendo and Universal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">would work together</a> almost thirty years later to create a series of theme parks.
</li><li> In 1975, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC">NBC</a> unveiled its new logo, a stylized letter "N" formed from two trapezoids, for which it had spent $750,000 to hire a graphics firm to design, print all-new stationery, etc. As it turned out, Nebraska Educational Television was already using an almost identical logo (which had cost <em>them</em> only $100 to create). In order to be able to keep the new logo, NBC settled with Nebraska Educational Television by providing them with equipment and cash worth over $850,000. NBC would eventually combine the N with their second 11-feathered peacock design. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:1979_NBC_logo.svg">[2]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em>, an American staple on NBC, made fun of the redesign when it was happening by showcasing on the Weekend Update segment fictional rejected logo concepts, each of which was a more angular, extreme, avant-garde combination of flat red and blue shapes. NBC reintegrated the peacock to the logo a mere three years later, and while not exactly like the first colour-flaunting 1956 peacock, it's highly evocative thereof.
</li></ul></li><li> German comedian Hubertus Albers has trademarked his alter ego's name Atze Schröder. In an inversion, he actually sends cease-and-desist letters to people who use his <em>real</em> name (but oddly enough, not the very trademark agency which shows it to everyone who asks).
</li><li> Just as silly is another German comedian, Mario Barth. He trademarked one of his slogans ("Nichts reimt sich auf Uschi" - "Nothing rhymes with [the name] Uschi", a play on the easily found rhyme "Muschi" [pussy]). So far so good, but unbeknownst to him the very same slogan had been used 20 years ago (albeit not trademarked) and printed on shirts by other comedians. He tried to sue people sporting those old shirts for copyright infringement.

They spent a lot of time designing a bottle that would be both instantly recognizable as a Coca-Cola container, nor mistakable as anything <em>but</em> a Coca-Cola bottle (<em>and</em> wouldn't fall over; the original designs were unstable). Notice that even the plastic two-liter bottles of Coca-Cola (and other Coke Company products) resemble the famous contour bottle, while every other brand's two-liter bottles look alike, particularly in having plain, straight edges.

</li><li> The Red Cross, by international treaty, owns the rights to a red cross. Using it in your video game to show medical supplies or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">The Medic</a> or in any other use is illegal. Before 1973, ambulances in the United States and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere were typically marked with a safety orange cross, differing from the red cross only in its hue. Toys and paintings of ambulances commonly ignored even that nuance, instead using a red cross. After protests from the American Red Cross that the safety orange cross was insufficiently distinguishable from the protected Red Cross symbol, the U.S. Department of Transportation developed the Blue Star of Life as a replacement for the safety orange cross.
<ul><li> This one is slightly different, though. The Red Cross is not quite doing it to be jerks, but because the treaty that the symbol is protected under is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLawsAndCustomsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLawsAndCustomsOfWar">the Geneva and Hague Conventions on the conduct of war</a>, and the reason it is protected is that it denotes critical infrastructure and personnel who are protected because they are connected with the treatment of casualties  i.e. the presence of a Red Cross on a legitimately protected person, vehicle or site makes it a war crime to fire upon or otherwise attack that person, vehicle or site, and conversely, falsely wearing or displaying a red cross as camouflage is <em>itself</em> a war crime. The fear is that overuse and misuse of the symbol could dilute the intended meaning of the symbol to a point where troops may not see it as protected anymore in a time of war.
</li><li> On August 9, 2007, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J) filed suit against the American Red Cross alleging trademark infringement. J&amp;J released a statement to the public on August 8, 2007 detailing its decision to file suit, claiming prior rights to the emblem. After the court rejected the substance of Johnson &amp; Johnson's complaint, the parties ultimately settled their differences, and the American Red Cross remains free to use its emblem in the sale of life-saving, disaster preparedness, and other mission-related products.

Then the Olympics Committee informed L5R's makers AEG that they had a trademark on ALL logos featuring five interlocking rings in any configuration - by an act of Congress, no less.

<div class="indent"><strong>Blue-Haired Lawyer:</strong> Principal Skinner, "The Happiest Place on Earth" is a registered Disneyland copyright. <br/><strong>Skinner:</strong> Whoa, gentlemen, it's just a small school carnival. <br/><strong>BHL:</strong> And it's heading for a great big lawsuit.

</div></li><li> Happens <em>again</em> in "Dude, Where's My Ranch?" when he interrupts the Simpsons caroling and tells them the most well-known carols are copyrighted, and Disney "owns" the song notes A-flat and G natural.
</li><li> In the episode "The Day the Violence Died", when the original creator of Itchy successfully sues the animation company for copyright infringement, the studio gets its money back when they sue the post office for using the character of Mr. Zip, which they claim is a rip-off of one of their founder's stick-figure mailman character.
