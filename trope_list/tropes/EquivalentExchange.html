</p><p>The principle of Equivalent Exchange typically says the object or goal a person will trade for must have equal value to what the person trades with. Who and what determines this "equivalency" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRules">varies from story to story</a>:
</p><ul><li> Does the Exchange measure emotional value, material value, or both? (Someone might find a penny handed down from father to son as worthless as if he found it on the ground, even though the father and son would consider it emotionally valuable.)
</li><li> If a wizard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RitualMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RitualMagic">ritually</a> sacrifices a cat to get some magical mojo, what determines how much power the wizard receives: the value of the cat's life to the wizard, the value of the cat's life to the cat, or the value of the cat's life to a deity(The latter is often why a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginSacrifice">Virgin Sacrifice</a> is considered better)?

An action only produces an equal and opposite reaction; a sacrificed cat will only release the energy of a cat, burning a human will work nearly the same as burning a human-sized carbon statue, and deconstructing an atomic nucleus to perform alchemical transmutation requires a nuclear reactor. In fiction, we can assume that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent">souls</a> become necessary to harness cosmic-scale energy or contain magical properties that don't follow the laws of thermodynamics (hence the necessity for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice">Human Sacrifice</a> as a viable form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtainium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtainium">unobtainium</a>).

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> serves as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> for anime and manga, as it makes a big deal out of the principle in its plot;
<ul><li> In regards to alchemical transmutation, the law basically works like the Newtonian law of conservation of matter: matter and energy cannot be created or destroyed in a reaction. (It also helps that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IsaacNewton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IsaacNewton">Isaac Newton</a>, one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifiers</a> in Real Life physics, considered himself an alchemist and formulated the basic principles of this trope.) The energy used to perform Amestrian alchemy comes from either tectonic shifts (the manga and <em>Brotherhood</em> anime) or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the souls of our world's deceased</span> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">the 2003 anime version</a>). Xingese <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">alkahestry</a> relies on reading and directing the Earth's natural energy through its mantle.
</li><li> Ed gets a wonderful chance to explain the principle at the start of the story. While talking with a religious zealot who believes her leader can resurrect her late boyfriend, Ed lists all the raw materials that exist in the human body — noting that anyone could buy a "body" with pocket change — before he explains that even with the materials gathered together, someone still can't make a human life because the exchange still doesn't have equivalency. He comes to a simple conclusion: you need a soul to complete the transmutation, and the right one at that. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">First, one can ask just how he figured this out. We soon learn the gory details. Second, if you don't care about what soul you want, you can make a massive army of homunculi...</span>
</li><li> The legend of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhilosophersStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhilosophersStone">Philosopher's Stone</a> says it enables an alchemist to perform any type of alchemy without cost (including human transmutation). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Elrics learn that even the Stone is just a massive alchemy battery: to make one, someone has to sacrifice a hell of a lot of people first. A massive human transmutation collects the souls of those sacrificed to make it and turns the stone into a massive portable power supply — one which lets its user create matter from the massive energy stored inside it, even if the energy seems to come from nothing. But it doesn't last forever, and it's highly inefficient from all the souls screaming struggling inside - unless you were to somehow convince them to willingly sacrifice their existence...</span>
</li><li> One of the central tenets of the series — and a sign of the development of Alphonse and Edward as people — shows that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">no matter how much they try and apply the rule of Equivalent Exchange to their lives, they always find something missing</span>. At the end of the manga and <em>Brotherhood</em>, they vow to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">give eleven back to every person or thing they take ten from, thus making the world richer</span>.
</li><li> Alphonse makes a crucial logical conclusion about the principle near the very end of the series. If A equals the cost of B, then the reverse should hold true: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NowDoItAgainBackwards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NowDoItAgainBackwards">you can exchange B back for A</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Once he figures it out, Al gives his soul <em>back</em> to Truth so Ed can have his right arm again and defeat Father once and for all. Ed does not take this development well.</span> After it happens, however, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Edward is able to top Alphonse by offering up the very truth of alchemy he received when they tried to bring their mother back as payment for Al's return</span>. It's not quite an even equation, however <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as Ed ends up losing not only his circle-free alchemy but his entire ability to perform alchemy, though it's later revealed he gave up his alchemy for his brother's soul, either way it's such a clever exchange that even Truth itself is floored</span>.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hoenheim likewise believes the theory has a flaw only in the <em>opposite</em> direction: "Even if I lived forever, I'd never give enough to have earned my sons/family."</span>
</li><li> The 2003 anime demonstrates why one should not use this trope as a philosophy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">Real Life is too complicated for such a neat transaction.</a> There are numerous factors involved, and randomness (i.e. Chaos Theory) can drive the result to positive or negative reactions. Dante uses this in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakThemByTalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakThemByTalking">Breaking Speech</a> to Ed.
</li><li> The adherence to this trope makes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler episodes</a> more obvious as they tend to avert it, such as an alchemist turning a small woodcarving tool into a full sized sword. Although, said sword quickly breaks when struck by a real metal blade.

<ul><li> Eventually, granting too many wishes within a short period of time means that someone ends up suffering some form of bad luck.
</li><li> This is also how wishes granted by demons run. They usually come with a myriad of attached strings that cause grief and misfortune to the person making the wish.

</li><li> To gain the incredible powers of God's Right Seat, a magician must give up his or her ability to use normal spells. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Acqua of the Back gets around this because his Divine Mother's Mercy removes limitations and secondary conditions.

If you want to use magic properly, you need to sacrifice an aspect of your being, like ability to dream, age, or memory; no wonder why magic practitioners are declining.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Nen abilities. It's a special ability invented by a user by using Nen, and it can range from simple super strength to shrinking cloths to memory reading to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser">vacuum cleaners and books and bank accounts</a>. Each of these abilities have unique powers that the user make up in his mind during conception. The more powerful you are, the more powerful ability you can create. The thing is, the more powerful the ability is, the more restrictions the user must needs impose on it as well. Examples are:
</li><li> Kuroro's Skill Hunter ability allows him to steal the Nen abilities of others and record them into his book, thus robbing them of that ability forever. It's an awesome move, but there are many rules. First, he must see the ability in action personally. Second, he has to ask the target about the ability and be answered. Third, the victim's hand must touch the palm print of the cover of the book. Lastly, all of the above must be done within only one hour. Otherwise, it's back to step one. Now, if you get the ability into the book, it's all well and good. But another rule is that if the original user dies, the ability vanishes from the book forever, and he can't use it anymore.
<ul><li> There is an exception to said rule though. Since Nen itself isn't a well known subject matter, there are literally hundreds of unknown variables that can improve or decrease Nen effectiveness. One variable in particular is that a person's Nen can actually grow even more STRONGER in death. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The best example of this is when Neferpitou's Self Manipulation Puppet Nen activated on its own and allowed her to attack at an even faster and unpredictable rate then ever before, even though by that point she was already dead from being punched to death by Gon.</span> If this post-death phenomenon happens to someone that Kuroro has stolen their Nen from then not only does the skill stay in the book, but it even becomes more effective and powerful then ever!
</li></ul></li><li> Kurapika's Chain Jail is a long chain used to wrap around the opponent's body. Not only that, it shuts down their aura, and prevents them from using Nen abilities. However, because it is an overpowered ability, he had to impose the condition that he could only use it on a member of the Genei Ryodan. If he uses it on a person who is not a member of the group, he dies. This causes problems because there are only at most thirteen members of the Genei Ryodan at any given time.
</li><li> Alluka Zaoldyk's wish-granting powers are an especially sadistic take on this since the price of the wish is passed on to someone else instead of the person making the wish. If that person can't fulfill Alluka's requests (and the requests can be as severe as <em>ripping out your own brain</em> if the preceding wish was significant enough), then that person and that person's loved one <em>die</em>. Depending on the severity of the wish, everyone that person has ever <em>met</em> is also at risk of dying instantly. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It is later revealed that this only applies to wholly selfish wishes. A wish to heal someone for example can be granted for free.</span>
</li><li> Kaito deliberately made his Nen ability annoying and inconvenient (the slot machine clown won't shut up, the weapon it summons is random, the scythe form can only be used for one technique, and the weapon can't be dismissed until it's used, etc.) to increase its power. He still complains about it.
</li><li> Franklin of the Genei Ryodan can fire very powerful Nen bullets from his fingertips. He made them that powerful by <em>mutilating his own fingers</em>.
</li><li> Shizuku, also a member of the Genei Ryodan, summons a vacuum cleaner that can suck up anything as long as it's not something Shizuku considers to be alive, and only the last object sucked up can be recovered.
</li><li> In chapter 305-307, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gon gives in to his rage and despair</span> and "uses everything" to defeat an incredibly powerful enemy. He basically sacrifices his future to rapidly age himself into an adult. This gave him the power to crush his foe, but it left him on the brink of death. The Nen curse he placed on himself to obtain that brief surge of power was too strong for the Hunter Organization's Nen Exorcist to even <em>consider</em> removing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It took the aforementioned Alluka's power to remove it.</span>

However, the sheer amount of chakra the jutsu consumes all but guarantees the caster signs their death warrant (Konan implies Nagato could have survived that had he not used up so much chakra in the battle beforehand, however, and Obito was able to stay alive thanks to "life support", though it's pointed out he was just getting extensions on top of all the <em>other</em> life-ending events that happened to him.</span>

<ul><li> It is an in-universe theory that the wishes that get fulfilled in exchange for the girls becoming magical girls are guaranteed to cause an amount of despair equal to the hope they generate. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelflessWish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelflessWish">Selfless Wish</a> for the sake of others would eventually lead to the wisher suffering in turn, unable to enjoy the very wish she herself generated, especially when the Magical Girl persona is forcing the wisher into isolation. "Hope and despair balance out to zero."

<ul><li> The price for wishes granted by Yuuko works this way. Some characters are much more wary of the possible implications of this than others. In particular, Kurogane and Doumeki will only ask for Yuuko's help if it is flat-out impossible for them to solve the problem under their own power. This is prudent, as false-hearted or impulsive wishes usually result in nasty karmic payback. Yuuko also has rules about not dealing in wishes of value equal to a human life, as that would implicate the wish-granter in murder.
</li><li> For the record, Yuuko accepts items or intangibilities that have both real and emotional power, which include both living and non-living: Kurogane's sword is both a precious reminder of his family and a powerful weapon; Fai's tattoo is imbued with powerful magic for his own safety; and Syaoran and Sakura pay by giving up a portion of Sakura's memories - those which contain Syaoran. This means their previous relationship is sacrificed forever. Syaoran has been edited out of the memories the feathers contain. For example, Sakura can remember the events of her last birthday party, but one seat is mysteriously empty, and there's an odd pause in the dialogue whenever someone would have otherwise said Syaoran's name. One time Sakura almost manages to put two and two together, but passes out and loses all memory of her deduction due to this price. It's not flat-out impossible for Sakura and Syaoran to have a relationship after paying the price, but it has to be rebuilt from the ground up.
</li><li> Interestingly, you apparently don't need someone to trade with, just need to have a payment to be given in exchange for a desired end. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Clow and Yuko gained entry into the cycle of reincarnation for the clones by giving their lives up to... nothing in particular. Watanuki and Syaoran Jr. escape from a pocket dimension in exchange for the inability to leave The Shop and the inability to remain in one world for very long, respectively, again not actually selling it to anyone in particular.</span>
</li><li> It eventually is revealed that whoever is the owner of the Wish Shop is essentially contractually bound to live by this principle at all times, lest they risk getting magically induced injuries from the shop itself as compensation. It's sobering when you realize that this is the primary reason for why Yuuko has made payment requests for the slightest things, even to friends, because no matter how much power she has, she <em>can't</em> give anyone anything without needing something from them in return... Except for feelings, which are explained to be the only things people can give without a price.

</li><li> From Comic 41 of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/KillLaKillAU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/KillLaKillAU">Kill la Kill AU</a>, we have Ryuuko's wish to be the sick one instead of her then ill sister Satsuki, which, as explained <a class="urllink" href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/2585114">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, traded her health in exchange for Satsuki's poor health, making her the sick one instead. As Rei did point out, said wish would make her suffer and could probably take her life through illness, something that circumstances otherwise would do with Satsuki.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry</a> in <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8957264/15/The-Next-Great-Adventure">The Next Great Adventure<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> admits to one of his companions that the reason only he can use a ritual that brings the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/WorldOfWarcraft">Forsaken</a> back to life is because "all the years [they] now have to live have to come from <em>somewhere</em>."
</li><li> Xanna and Naruto are willing to give a follower who's proven themselves eternal youth in <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10917821/1/The-questionable-burdens-of-leadership-of-a-troll-Emperor">The (Questionable) Burdens of Leadership of a Troll Emperor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>. However, they will also become incapable of having children (to avoid overly taxing the Empire's resources with a growing immortal population). As a result, very few accept it unless, like Setsuna, they've committed themselves to a cause and aren't interested in having a family.
</li><li> Likewise in <em><a class="urllink" href="http://ficwad.com/story/213011">Eroninja<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, the eternal youth granted to Naruto's lovers only lasts until they have a child. As Naruto can't have children, they'd have to break off their relationship with him and have a child with someone else, losing their immortality in the process. Naruto on the other hand will live forever as the Kyuubi doesn't want her beloved dying and leaving her alone. The Kyuubi is willing to offer eternal youth to the immediate family of Naruto's lovers at the same cost of never having children. Like the above example, this is to prevent overly taxing the world's resources and to prevent resentment among the mortals towards immortals.

<ul><li> Christopher Paolini's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle">Inheritance Cycle</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic">entire magic system</a></em> of the series is wrapped up in this. Doing something with magic takes the same amount of energy as doing it without magic would have done. And if you try casting a spell that takes up more energy than you have, you die.
</li><li> This is what he says, but at one point, Eragon breaks the calves of dozens (maybe hundreds) of soldiers and doesn't die.
</li><li> And certain spells are just flat-out impossible, presumably because they take far too much energy, or simply cannot be done. For example: Eragon is warned to never try to bring people back from the dead; beyond death, there's just something that magic has no effect on; an attempt would drain the mage of all his life in one go and accomplish nothing. Trying to see the future or the past is a bad idea as well. It's actually explained in the books that if you're trying to see the future, it's a lot like scrying, in that you need to know exactly what's going to happen, down to the last detail. But if you already know what's going to happen, then scrying the future is functionally pointless.
</li><li> Although in the second book, the young woman running the Varden finds some wiggle room in the rules: doing something with magic takes less <em>time</em> than it would otherwise, therefore magic-users can outperform in tasks which are complicated but low-energy. And that's the story of how the Varden climbs out of a financial hole by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">producing and selling finely made lacework for ladies garments</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>:
<ul><li> This comes up a lot with magic in the books, where it is referred to as the Law of Conservation of Reality. For example, to teleport someone from one side of the disc to another, you may need to have an equivalent weight to teleport back to where they came from. This is mainly to deal with conservation of momentum; because the Disc rotates, different points on its surface move at different velocities relative to the Hub. Teleporting without such a counterweight means that if you move very far, your velocity relative to your immediate surroundings tends to kill you. But you can do it!
</li><li> This is still an imperfect science, and when the wizards of Unseen University try it to retrieve Rincewind in <em>Interesting Times</em>, he's hit on the head by all the crap they piled up to equal his weight, going the other way.
</li><li> It comes up more often with conjuration than with transportation. If you wanted to make, for example, a loaf of bread appear, the casting thereof would have to expend all the energy that went into making the bread—so, growing the grain, grinding it into flour, mixing the dough, all the heat it took to bake it—or else you'd have a loaf of bread for about half a second and then it would vanish again. It is also described that the magical act of creating that loaf of bread as a permanent thing takes so much effort that it might cause the wizard's brain to forcibly evacuate his skull through his ears. So mostly they just don't bother.
</li><li> Another anecdote describes how using magic to levitate a book from a high shelf to lay it down in front of you will fatigue you as much as actually climbing a ladder to take the book directly.
</li><li> Esk mentions it outright.
<div class="indent"><strong>Esk:</strong> I don't think magic works like that. You can't just make things happen, there's sort of- like a seesaw thing, if you push one end up, the other goes down. <br/><strong>Gulta:</strong> I can't see Granny on a seesaw.
</div></li><li> In the book <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sourcery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sourcery">Sourcery</a>, there is a sort of explanation why the magic works that way with the arrival of the titular Coin the Sourceror. There is only the certain amount of magic in the Discworld. Not using the equivalent exchange (brain seeping through wizard's skull because of effort notwithstanding) spends the magic of the world so it is irretrievably lost. Discworld needs magic to function. Spend too much magic and reality becomes thin. The opposite is true as well, because the wizards get a lot more magic to work with when Coin the Sourceror arrives, making working with it much easier because Coin inputs fresh magic into the system. Spending it still makes the reality and the world thinner, though, because there is only so much you can change part of reality with magic until it goes completely unreal, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipOfTheseus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipOfTheseus">Ship Of Theseus</a> style.

So he was bought to work as a freedman at his court by Stannis Baratheon's father, since he could afford him and had three sons to try distracting. Unfortunately, the ship sank on the way back, just in sight of Stormsend. All hands were lost, leaving many families grieving for their loved ones. Except... Patchface alone washed up days later, seemingly more dead than alive, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">but not as an actual corpse like all the other bodies</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadOracle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadOracle">He's</a> not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown">exactly</a> been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalClown">the same</a>, since, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerBornOfMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerBornOfMadness">though</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> The magic system in Eric Nylund's <em>Pawn's Dream</em> works through a variation of Equivalent Exchange, where opposite elementals must be present, but it varies whether users need to trade them or simply summon or banish both. Either way, most of the skill in magic is based on letting both elements flow freely.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SagaOfRecluce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SagaOfRecluce">Saga of Recluce</a></em> series by L. E. Modesitt Jr. is set in a world of Chaos and Order Magic, both of which must be carefully balanced—at times, overuse of either, or just too much Order or Chaos concentrated in one area, has shifted the entire planet's weather patterns, caused volcanic eruptions, and other disasters. Despite that the balance is well-known in-universe, it didn't stop people from trying to cheat. Recluce itself, for example, was protected by a navy of Order-infused ships...and every time they replaced one, it was with a larger, more powerful ship that required more Order.
</li><li> The novels in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a> emphasize that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide">Sith</a> path is one of sacrifice, i.e., <em>demolishing</em> attachments instead of the Jedi path of <em>avoiding</em> attachments. Since the Sith draw power from pain and rage, easy or pleasant trade-offs aren't in the picture. Which makes the Emperor's plan of either 'Luke kills his father' or 'Anakin kills his son' at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em> make a lot more sense.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonScottCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonScottCard">Orson Scott Card</a> is very fond of this trope and said that it is a practical necessity for a fantasy story driven by magic, writing in <em>How to Write Science Fiction and Fantasy</em> that without it, the "characters become gods...and there is no story". In that book, he proposes some grotesque systems of magical exchange, including killing (a human grants you more power than an animal; a child grants more power than an adult) or losing body parts for power (your own body parts fall off; or someone else's fall off, but they must be given willingly; or body parts of the one you truly love the most fall off; or a random person's fall off, but they tend to have a connection to the spellcaster). And as he mentioned in <em>How to Write Science Fiction and Fantasy</em>, Card actually wrote a novel in such a setting: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HartsHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HartsHope">Hart's Hope</a></em>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deryni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deryni">Deryni</a></em> series, magic is physically taxing, with more powerful workings (say, Calling to another Deryni over a great distance, particularly when the other Deryni doesn't expect it and isnt helping to bridge the gap from the other end) causing more fatigue. Fatigue-banishing spells exist, but they cannot be re-used indefinitely, and the rejuvenation they provide can be quickly lost if the person experiences more stress. Training also seems to extend endurance within limits, much as people who physically train increase athletic endurance to a point. Tiercel makes this analogy: ...you're flexing abilities you've never used before. You have to build up your endurance. I'll bet you've got a headache just from this afternoon's work.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ColdFireTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ColdFireTrilogy">Cold Fire Trilogy</a></em>:
<ul><li> Magical energy is released by sacrifice. The amount of energy gained is directly proportional to how much the sacrificed object was worth to the sorcerer. This is one of the facts used to show the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastardness</a> of Gerald Tarrent, who sacrificed his entire family to gain immortality. The spell wouldn't have worked if he hadn't loved his wife and children very, very much - and he killed them <em>anyway</em>.
</li><li> It's later explained that the sacrifice which made him immortal wasn't actually his wife and children. It was <em>his own humanity</em>, which he lost through the expedient of killing his wife and children. And if he ever tried to act like a compassionate human being again by engaging in an act of life or Healing, his immortality would be forfeit.
</li><li> Another huge example in the backstory explains why humanity is stuck on Erna without any of the technology that got them there in the first place. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">One of the expedition leaders, Ian Casca, sacrificed the colony ship and most of its advanced technology to make the <em>fae</em> into something humans could harness and control. In exchange for immediate survival, Casca gave up any chance for the colonists to escape the damn planet. The colonists killed him when they discovered this.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In the early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnitaBlake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnitaBlake">Anita Blake</a></em> stories, one must kill a living thing to create undead. Anita routinely uses goats for that purpose. Of course, most magic is swallowed up by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusSexMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusSexMachina">Deus Sex Machina</a> as the series moves forward. (She has kept the goats out of that part.)
</li><li> This is a rule of magic in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TortallUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TortallUniverse">Tortall Universe</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TamoraPierce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TamoraPierce">Tamora Pierce</a>, demonstrated in several ways.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheImmortals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheImmortals">Wolf Speaker</a></em>, a man is turned into a tree and we are told that, somewhere in the world, a tree is now a man. (Pierce later wrote about him in a short story which is collected in <em>Tortall and Other Lands</em>.)
</li><li> Words of Power differ from regular use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGift">The Gift</a> in needing equivalent exchange. You can do more minor stuff rather easily. However, for example, destroying a powerful magical barrier with Words would have caused a major natural disaster elsewhere.
</li><li> Additionally, we find out in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProtectorOfTheSmall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProtectorOfTheSmall">Protector of the Small</a></em> that the use of the Dominion Jewel to prevent an earthquake (at the end of <em>Song of the Lioness</em>) cost the fertility of all the grain in the kingdom. They had to import all their bread and seed wheat the next year, and the kingdom was in debt for years paying it off.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungWizards">Young Wizards</a></em> series, "spells" are essentially equations written in a magical language and equations always have to balance, one way or another. In one book, a character holds off the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeehiveBarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeehiveBarrier">shielding spell</a> which is later explained to have been fueled by a year of the character's life per strike. (The Devil hits <em>hard</em>.) In another, that same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">sealed away</a> by a ritual that requires a willing sacrifice; one character attempts to take the place of the intended victim <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and a third actually does</span>. It's implied that this event might have come to pass because of events in the prior book: to cast a spell they couldn't have powered alone to seal away an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Artifact of Doom</a> they used a "blank check" spell in which they essentially promise that the power they use will be repaid at some unknown date in the future.
</li><li> The "death magic" in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LoisMcMasterBujold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LoisMcMasterBujold">Lois McMaster Bujold</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCurseOfChalion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCurseOfChalion">The Curse of Chalion</a></em> is like this: it's a way to murder someone at a distance, but as part of the spell's workings, the person casting the spell will die, too. In addition to this little drawback, it's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">believed to be</span> very difficult, and requires animal sacrifice as well. Plus, the God of Executioners has to be invoked and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he only lets the magic work when the victim <em>deserves</em> to die</span>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BarryTrotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BarryTrotter">Barry Trotter</a></em> parody of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> series mentions this in the sequel, where everyone has graduated and started families <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(despite being effectively proven wrong by the final book)</span>. It's only then that Barry learns that to summon something with magic is actually just teleportation, thus "created" items always come from somewhere else. This coincidentally results in a poor sap whose possessions always go missing on Barry's birthday.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BrokenSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BrokenSky">Broken Sky</a></em>:
<ul><li> This series has "spirit stones", which grant people special abilities but drain their energy when used, placed into the spines of characters. Ryushi, for example, can emit a powerful blast of energy, but it drains him to the point of collapsing to do so.
</li><li> We're later introduced to people with healing spirit stones. They can heal the wounds of others by taking them on themselves, although the healers have a slightly improved healing rate.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNeverendingStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNeverendingStory">The Neverending Story</a></em>, AURYN grants humans the ability to make their wishes come true, by rewriting reality in Fantastia so that it always was so. In exchange, AURYN takes away a memory of the Outer World from the human with each wish. They start off reasonable enough (trading the memory of being fat and scared for a more heroic figure), but eventually descends into taking more and more precious memories, no matter how selfish the wish is (the memory of being from the outer world, the memory of one's parents, the memory of one's own <em>name</em>). In the book, the wishes don't even have to be spoken, either. If you want something badly enough, AURYN will sense it, grant that wish and take a memory with no effort on your part.
</li><li> A system of Equivalent Exchange is enforced in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchSeries">Night Watch (Series)</a></em> books. Basically, the forces of good and evil have a treaty regulating and limiting their actions. When one side uses their power to interfere with humanity, the treaty demands that the other side receive an equal intervention. Hence a Light mage can heal someone, but that gives a Dark witch the right to curse someone. The system works overall, with most "Others" (the series term for supernatural beings) willing to go through the proper channels to get licensing for using their powers. (For example, vampires annually receive a license to feed on a living human, though not all use them.) If an Other breaks the rules, the Watches (the police of the Others) will locate and punish them (with most crimes being sentenced to death). If a member of the Watches breaks the rules to a relatively small extent, they can offer the other Watch an equal intervention as a compromise.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertSilverberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertSilverberg">Robert Silverberg</a>'s early novel <em>The Time Hoppers</em>, time travel is done by exchanging matter between the present and the past; when a human is sent back, an equivalent mass of air has to be brought forward.
</li><li> Happens in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a>'s stories:
<ul><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheUglyLittleBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheUglyLittleBoy">The Ugly Little Boy</a>": Timmie, the titular character, is a Neanderthal youth scooped out of the past and kept in a suite of rooms specially "time-shielded". Bringing him fully into the present would require the expenditure of a mass-equivalent amount of energy proportional to the distance he traveled in time. The various rooms of different time-shielded artifacts are constantly costing energy because of air from the past escaping into the present (the present-day air heading into the past isn't costing energy).
</li><li> Two cases in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GeorgeAndAzazel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GeorgeAndAzazel">George and Azazel</a></em> stories:
<ul><li> "The Smile That Loses" has a man's smile transferred to a photo, and as a result he gets sick.
</li><li> "Writing Time" has Azazel helping a man who complains of always having to wait for doctors or taxis. Azazel puts the world in order for him, but states the Second Law of Thermodynamics cannot be bypassed — he simply spread the entropy all over the Solar System, including by shortening the Sun's life.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In Cornelia Funke's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheInkWorldTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheInkWorldTrilogy">The Ink World Trilogy</a></em>, characters can be read out of books into the real world, but not without someone or something from the real world taking their place
</li><li> The three magic systems from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mistborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mistborn">Mistborn</a></em> work this way.
<ul><li> Allomancy requires the wielder to consume fragments of metal and "burn" them in their stomachs to power certain effects; some of these metals are considerably rarer than others, and the metal duralumin acts as a catalyst for burning whatever other metals are in the user's stomach <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">very, very fast</a></em>.
</li><li> Feruchemy allows the wielder to temporarily drain him or herself of a certain quality or ability - memory, skill, age, health, senses - store it in a piece of metal, and retrieve it later as needed (for example, a Feruchemist could temporarily become very weak, and then later "tap" the stored energy to acquire superhuman strength). It's not always much of a cost though. While there are few benefits to making oneself weak, there's mention of feruchemists draining their youth to disguise themselves as old men, and Sazed drains his weight so he can jump down a great height without damage.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">Hemalurgy</a> does not require fuel, but it does require leeching abilities from Allomancers and Feruchemists <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by stabbing them with particular metals and then permanently implanting them in oneself in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">particular places</a></span>, and often leads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">great insanity</a>. Also, it's inherently wasteful: the powers you steal with it are always somewhat weaker than the original.
</li><li> Compounders are a quirk of the system. If someone has matching Allomantic and Ferchemical metals, then they can store an attribute in a metalmind then burn the metalmind, creating a much larger burst of power, which they can then store, and then burn, creating an infinite loop of power. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Lord Ruler</span> managed to gain immortality by Compounding youth in an atiummind (though after a thousand years his age was still catching up with him), and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAlloyOfLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAlloyOfLaw">The Alloy of Law</a></em> a double-gold Twinborn has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> that makes Wolverine look like a wimp. He shoots himself in the face with a shotgun to prove to his men he's invincible, hasn't felt pain in decades, carries around dynamite to blow himself up if someone tries catching him with a net, and doesn't even need to breathe if he flares his power enough. He still ages, but that's his only weakness. As long as he has gold, he can't be killed.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStormlightArchive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStormlightArchive">The Stormlight Archive</a></em>: There are at least two types of magic falling under this law:
<ul><li> Surgebinding produces various effects (from flight to trasmutation to healing), consuming the stormlight infused in gems in exchange.
</li><li> The Old Magic is granted by a spirit called the Nightwatcher. Everyone who deals with the Nightwatcher can ask for a blessing, but in exchange must also receive a curse, chosen by the spirit. One minor character mentions trying to word his wish in such a way to avoid a curse, but is informed it doesn't work like that. You tell the Nightwatcher what you want, she considers it, and gives you a curse she finds to be of equal value. It might be related, but it could just as easily not.
</li></ul></li><li> The entire basis of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DevonMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DevonMonk">Devon Monk</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AllieBeckstrom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AllieBeckstrom">Allie Beckstrom</a></em> novels. Magic always exacts a price, usually in pain. The user can choose between an hour-long migraine or a week-long head cold, but the price will be paid. For the protagonist, magic also takes her memories. For small spells, she'll forget what her stepmother's name is. For large spells, she'll wake up with a three week hole in her life. She carries a journal with her everywhere, with her name, address, etc. written on the first page, just in case.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BrasAndBroomsticks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BrasAndBroomsticks">Bras and Broomsticks</a></em> series by Sarah Mlynowski, if someone uses magic to get something, that thing will be taken from wherever it comes from. For example, the main character's sister makes oranges to give to the homeless, but there is an orange shortage in stores in the area.
</li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DuelOfSorcery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DuelOfSorcery">Changer's Moon</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Serroi</a> turns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer">Ser Noris</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">into a tree</a>.</span> The price? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She turns into a tree herself</span>. (Although that was less a function of the magic itselfshe'd previously <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a> into trees with no ill effect</span>than of using it on an opponent of such power.)
</li><li> Roger Zelazny's <em>Changeling</em> follows this logic for moving items between universes.
</li><li> Stephen Donaldson's second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfThomasCovenant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfThomasCovenant">The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant</a></em> has the mere mortals of the land required to shed blood (both their own and the blood of others is used) in order to manipulate the Sunbane. The first chronicle has Mhoram realizing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the key to power is despair, which will lead to the destruction of the Land</span>.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChinaMieville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChinaMieville">China Miéville</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IronCouncil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IronCouncil">Iron Council</a></em>, a character is beholden to an interesting version of this. They are a monk of the God of Secrets; part of this means that they can ask the god for knowledge about a secret: a secret path, what the enemy is planning, and so on. But they have to give up some of their own knowledge to do so. The character in question lost knowledge of her gender as a result of this.
</li><li> Sympathy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKingkillerChronicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKingkillerChronicle">The Kingkiller Chronicle</a></em> follows the actual First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics, so that heat and work applied to a target have to be taken from somewhere and transfer of energy can be rather inefficient. In practice, this means that people have killed themselves trying to raise winds with their diaphragms and light candles with their body heat.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a> novella <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FullDarkNoStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FullDarkNoStars">Fair Extension</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LouisCypher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LouisCypher">George</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignificantAnagram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignificantAnagram">Elvid</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">offers to cure Dave Streeter's cancer</a> at the cost of inflicting it on someone else. Since that someone else happens to be his ex-girlfriend who cheated on him with his ex-best friend, Streeter isn't exactly bothered.
</li><li> In Ian Irvine's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThreeWorldsCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThreeWorldsCycle">The Three Worlds Cycle</a></em>, use of magic (or "the Secret Art") is balanced by "aftersickness": debilitating headaches and nausea. Unskilled "mancers" may even get the aftersickness without the magical effect they were going for. This, however, is nothing compared to the risks of trying to draw too much power from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic">the field</a>: you get "anthracised", where the sheer power you're trying to channel burns you alive from the inside out. Of course, it's lovingly described in detail in one of the books.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ACivilCampaign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ACivilCampaign">A Civil Campaign</a></em>: Cordelia Naismith-Vorkosigan points out that her home planet of Beta Colony is extremely sexually liberal, yes, but at the cost of being <em>reproductively</em> conservative. All women, by law, have a contraceptive implant, and people wanting to become parents are subject to a battery of tests before being licensed. Very few families are allowed more than two kids. This is not something the writer just made up, mind you; both the sexual liberality and the implants had been mentioned throughout the series, but it is the first time the connection was explicitly explained.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em>: While use of saidar is more or less free, the Aelfinn and Eelfinn operate on this basis, and from most non-main characters important things like valuable knowledge, cooperation and items must be bargained for, often with extensive negotiations over the price the heroes must pay.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RudyRucker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RudyRucker">Rudy Rucker</a>'s <em>Master of Space and Time</em>, time travel <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">supposedly</span> requires sending something forward in time if you send something backward.

</li><li> One of the primary rules for magic in Simon Hawke's <em>The Wizard Of 4th Street</em> series, and all but spelled out by Merlin himself in the prequel novel The Wizard of Camelot. You can't get something for nothing with magic, as even the simplest spell requires life energy to fuel. This is the source of conflict for the series as while the heroes use Thaumaturgy and draw on their own life essences for power, the antagonists the Dark Ones use Necromancy and forcibly steal life energy from others for their magic. Also, when Merlin "creates" a feast for an impoverished English family who's hosting him, he states that the raw materials for the food were actually drawn from the surrounding area, i.e. there was a pig nearby to provide ham, a stag for the venison, wild fruits for the pies, etc.

</li><li> Similarly, though perhaps a more accurate example of this trope, when Buffy is brought back to life at the start of Season 6, the spell creates a brand new demon through a process Willow calls "Thaumogenesis". As she explains, the universe doesn't like you getting things for free, there has to be a cost and they asked for a huge gift; Buffy's life back, so the universe said "Ok, but you have to have this evil demon too". This fits the trope as its a Good Thing/Bad Thing equal parts deal but as Anya rightfully points out "That's not a cost, that's a gift with purchase".

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleSpirits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleSpirits">Battle Spirits</a></em>, everything has a cost of core, even if it's just a low amount, though it can be reduced through the cards specified reductions and other effects. Some double symbol spirits require the tribute of another spirit to summon them.
</li><li> The Defilers in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkSun">Dark Sun</a></em> setting for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>. Both Defilers and Preservers need to drain life forces in order to power arcane magic, but defilers drain it away without worrying about the consequences, while Preservers are careful not to drain enough to kill the plants and animals nearby that are contributing. Considering that Athas is a gigantic desert world, it's not hard to deduce the popularity of defiler magic. (Or, since this fact is now known to the general public, the <em>un</em>popularity of arcane magic users in general, since they're all assumed to be Defilers.)
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a></em> setting, curses can be invoked by ordinary people, but attempting to do so invites a Powers check. If failed, the curse-layer will suffer karmic retribution from the Dark Powers. In an Equivalent Exchange Of Payback, the curse is actually more likely to work if the curse-layer fails this check.
</li><li> Most magick in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/UnknownArmies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/UnknownArmies">Unknown Armies</a></em> works this way. The "value" of certain actions varies based on what kind of adept you are. Typically an adept gets a "minor charge" for some kind of ritual that's easy enough to be performed every day or so, a "significant charge" for doing something very difficult and painful, and a "major charge" for doing something nigh-impossible. And even the magick that seems to be free usually isn't. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/UnknownArmies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/UnknownArmies">Unknown Armies</a></em>, ain't nothin' come for free. There's even an in-game term for the concept in UA: The Law of Transaction.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a></em> version of the Tremere House and Clan is practically built around this trope. Originally mages, the Tremere turned themselves into magical creatures when magic began weakening, out of a supposition that said creatures would last a while longer during magic's decline. However, in doing so, they lost the essence that made them mages in the first place, and got what was, in essence, a surrogate. The price of power, indeed.
</li><li> Present in the TCG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> to an extent. Every spell has a cost. Most are simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Mana</a> drawn from the land, but others require a life (yours or your creatures), the land itself, or even time (skipping a turn). Several cards will actually kill you if the cost is too much for you to afford. Perhaps the most famous example of this is Necropotence. You don't draw normally near the beginning of your turn; instead, you may pay X life to draw X cards at the end of your turn. However, this particular exchange turned out not too equivalent: both cards with this effect proved to be broken beyond imagination. For the uninitiated: Unless you know exactly what you are doing and have built your deck specifically to respond to various threats, playing Necropotence is pretty much suicide.
<ul><li> There are also some cards that are balanced this way: they give you a benefit or harm your opponent, but also do the same thing to every other player. One example is <em>Braids, Conjurer Adept</em>: she lets you play a card for free at the start of every one of your turns, but your opponent(s) get to do the same. There's plenty of cards that follow a similar pattern. They tend to be particularly common in products focused on multiplayer environments, such as Commander releases; indeed, one specific strategy - the "Group Hug" deck - works by providing nice things to your opponents, so that they won't want to interrupt the flow of gifts and focus on other players instead of you.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer Fantasy</a></em>, the species known as the Dragon Ogres succeeded at making a deal with Tzeentch that rendered their entire species immortal and able to subsist on lightning alone as energy — but the spell also struck them all sterile, so no new Dragon Ogres has been born since. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Tzeentch is kind of a dick like that</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeistTheSinEaters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeistTheSinEaters">Geist: The Sin-Eaters</a></em>, a Sin-Eater can come back from the dead easily (yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstEpisodeResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstEpisodeResurrection">more than once</a>). Problem is, in addition to the act knocking a chunk off your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Karma Meter</a>, your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhostsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhostsAreDifferent">geist</a> is going to draw that life force directly from someone else. And when you wake from your brief dirt nap, your face is covered in an ectoplasmic caul that conveys <em>all</em> the details of that person's death.
</li><li> The magic system in "The Valdorian Age" (a setting for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HeroSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HeroSystem">Fantasy Hero</a>) can be summarized as "you convince otherworldly/extraplanar beings to do something for you". However, they're doing it as a favor, and eventually they will require a favor from you in exchange ... which, depending on how big your debt is when it gets called in, could involve things like killing all the inhabitants of a village in one night. No one ever claimed those otherworldly beings were <em>nice</em>.
</li><li> Several of the magic systems in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendOfTheFiveRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendOfTheFiveRings">Legend of the Five Rings</a></em> work this way. Shugenja do not so much manipulate the elements themselves as convince elemental spirits to do them favors, and much of their duties involve making sure said spirits are happy. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">Maho</a></em> is directly powered by the shedding of blood - but good news! It doesn't have to be <em>your</em> blood.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost">Changeling: The Lost</a></em>, this is the basis of Pledgecraft: Changelings can create magical bargains known as Pledges, each incorporating a task, a boon, a sanction and a duration. Boons and durations count toward the cost of a pledge, while task and sanction count against it, and all Pledges must have a net worth of zero. A clever changeling can still game the system a bit by such expedients as making a pledge that if given a healer's knowledge for a day, they will use it at least once that day, on pain of misfortune. If you make the pledge when a companion is already injured and needs first aid, satisfying the task is laughably easy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Sidereal Exalted have the charm called Of Things Desired and Feared, which uses astrology to provide an infallible way to achieve <em>any</em> objective you can state... for an appropriate price. If what you want to achieve is small, it is likely the price will be something you are willing to pay (a few bruises, the lost of an item, etc.). But if you ask for a Fate-proven way to defeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> or otherway break the game, the price will be something like "your life, the lives of everyone in your Circle, and the complete destruction of all the thing you value and care for".
</li><li> Some other charms have a drawback to balance out the benefits. This is especially true of a number of Green Sun Prince charms, like the one that allows you to not need sleep, but requires you to run in order to rest, the one that allows you to longer without sleep in exchange for nightmares when you <em>do</em>, and the one that allows you to become telepathic at the cost of turning all noise into white noise for you.
</li><li> In the Third Edition teaser PDF for the Infernals, it's revealed that, to keep the other Primordials from making their own Exalted, Autochthon devised "The Law of Diminishment" and inserted it into She Who Lives in Her Name, which states that any who empowers others is weakened in turn (which is why, even with the divine fire of the Exigence helping them make their own Exalted champions, many weaker gods cannot survive the creation of an Exigent).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Godbound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Godbound">Godbound</a></em>, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoked</a> in one of the vignettes, where Jakob agrees to use his Fertility power to ensure that the knyaz would have a son by his infertile wife (and thus prevent a messy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a>), and in return would see that one of Jakob's enemies died. "Life for life, for the gods are fair." (However, this is not a necessary condition of the power in question, just a condition that Jakob set.)

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland">Monkey Island</a></em> games have this as an element of Voodoo magic. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheCurseOfMonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheCurseOfMonkeyIsland">The Curse of Monkey Island</a></em>, Guybrush needs to find need a diamond as big as or bigger than the one that turned his fiancé to stone. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeFromMonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeFromMonkeyIsland">Escape from Monkey Island</a></em>, he needs to make an Ultimate Insult talisman as large as or bigger than the original in order to counter its effects. (No explanation is given on why his enemies can counter Guybrushs insults even when he has the larger talisman, although it <em>is</em> only the <em>second</em> biggest monkey head Guybrush has ever seen...)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OracleOfTao" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OracleOfTao">Oracle of Tao</a></em> has a variety of these. Most magic uses MP as its price, but some abilities are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">Cast From Hit Points</a>. On the other end of the scale, you have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaShield">Mana Shield</a>. And then there's Elias's alchemy, which aside from making cool items, has certain alchemy spells. But in order to learn each spell or make a super-rare item (like gold), you sacrifice anywhere from a level to 10 levels (and you can combine spells together, meaning there's a chance you might end up making the same spell more than two times).
</li><li> Whenever the Nameless One from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment">Planescape: Torment</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">dies and comes back, someone else somewhere on the Great Wheel dies as a result, becoming a tormented shadow whose only desire is to hunt down the Nameless One and kill him again</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile">Valkyrie Profile</a></em>, the ritual of Soul Exchange allows someone to sacrifice their own life to bring someone else back. However, it won't work on someone who died by using the same ritual, and one character ends up undead for attempting this.
</li><li> This was a main part of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheImmortal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheImmortal">The Immortal</a></em>. Your character starts with a magic amulet that, you eventually discover, has the power to kill a dragon (the creature that awaits you at the end of your adventure). However, it turns out the amulet also kills the person who uses it (you could easily discover this at any point by using the damned thing), and the whole game is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a> by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> to get you to kill the dragon (sacrificing your life in the process) because he needed the dragon dead, but obviously couldn't use the amulet himself without dying.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em>, Link can acquire a magical suit of golden armor which will prevent him from taking any damage. However, whenever he wears it, his wallet is slowly drained of money, and he loses extra money every time he takes a hit. Once he runs out of Rupees (the coin of the realm), the armor weighs him down considerably, making his movements slow and awkward.
</li><li> A popular mod for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em> by the same name revolves around this trope. This mod gives every item in the game an EMC value (Energy-Matter-Currency). These items can be exchanged for each other using a Minium Stone/Philosopher's Stone if the EMC value is the same.
</li><li> The world <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KartiaTheWordOfFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KartiaTheWordOfFate">Kartia</a></em> revolves around magical cards, Kartia, that can be used to create basically anything, from living battle-creatures to spells to specific kinds of food and drink. There are a number of Original Kartia (such as "Life" "Death" and "Human"), the use of which is forbidden and will automatically cause the death of the caster. For most of the game, the player and the characters believe that the Kartia creates things from nothingness <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but as it turns out, it just takes things from Eden, a parallel world inhabited by Elves and rich with natural magic. In fact, it is theoretically possible to "create" the whole Eden with Original Kartia, something that is half-accomplished twice during the story. It also turns out that Original Kartia doesn't kill the user, but rather transports them to Eden</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> Warlock magic is said to work like this.
<div class="indent"><strong>Grom:</strong> With hell's fire, you make a bargain. It costs a little of yourself. The warlock's way was quicker, more effective, or so it seemed. But there comes a time when a price must be paid, and sometimes, it is dear indeed.
</div></li><li> Don't expect to ever have to pay that price <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">yourself</a> though.
</li><li> Examples include the Life Tap spell (converts health into mana points), Health Funnel (heals your pet demon at a cost of your own health), Hellfire (which burns you as well as your enemies), and Ritual of Doom (summons a powerful demon; originally one party member would die upon completion, now one member is simply badly wounded). Other spells are fuelled with Soul Shards, gained by killing foes with a particular spell.
</li><li> Although now, Warlocks have a low-level spell that lets them restore all their soul shards by apparently breaking off little pieces of their OWN SOUL (at no real cost in gameplay terms, though it is interruptible and thus best used out of combat/between fights).
</li><li> Doomguards don't even require the ritual of summoning or sacrifice of health anymore. Just hit a button, and BOOM he's there fighting on your side for 45 seconds.
</li><li> In the <em>Ashbringer</em> comic, Darion Mograine seeks to free his father Alexandros' soul from the Scourge and the corrupted Ashbringer sword. He is told that an act of love greater than the act of evil that originally stole Alexandros' soul (being betrayed and killed by his oldest son) is needed to free him, but he's also warned that such an act of love is often the greatest test of faith. To free his father's soul, Darion impales himself with Ashbringer, freeing his father but unintentionally became a Death Knight of the Scourge himself.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em>:
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chidori sacrifices herself</span> to revive <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Junpei</span> under this principle.
</li><li> From the same game, the skill Recarmdra fully heals all your allies' HP in exchange for yours becoming 1. It costs only 1% of your total SP, but it is still terribly risky given how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCannotGoOnWithoutYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCannotGoOnWithoutYou">it's game over if the leader is KO'd</a>.
</li><li> Recarmdra is present in many games in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a></em> series, where it often does kill the user to fully heal the rest of the party. Because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCannotGoOnWithoutYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCannotGoOnWithoutYou">how the games are in general</a>, only the recruitable demons and not the main character can get it.
</li></ul></li><li> The various Dark Powersets from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em> tend to work like this, Dark Miasma in particular. Dark Miasma has some highly potent healing spells (Including the only rezz in the game capable of reviving multiple people.) but in order to use them you have to tap into the life force of your enemies. This is just icing on the cake, really... The only real downside of these powers was that you had to have an enemy to engage to use them. So you couldn't heal or rezz BETWEEN fights.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em>, many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer">Necromancer</a> spells, mostly under the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">Blood Magic</a> attribute, require the Necromancer to sacrifice a certain percentage of their maximum health, in addition to a small amount of MP, to cast. In addition, Necromancers also have many spells that require there to be a fresh corpse somewhere nearby for them to "exploit". These spells include raising undead servants, creating a "well" of energy that performs various effects, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">healing</a>, or simply making the corpse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">explode</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em>, Mages can perform magic effortlessly, but more powerful spells and rituals occasionally require the use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks">Lyrium</a>, distilled into a consumable liquid form for this purpose. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">Blood Mages</a> however, can use either their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy">Life Energy</a> or another's to perform powerful feats that non-Blood Mages cannot, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a>, as well as ripping the blood out of their opponents pores. While one can learn the skills safely through books written on the subject, these are usually restricted for obvious reasons, thus forcing more desperate (or foolhardy) mages to make a bargain with a Demon to gain the power. What the bargain requires changes from person to person, but most cases end with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">the Demon possessing the Mage</a> and turning them into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">an Abomination</a>.

Tlaloc gave his life to divide the Tezcatlipoca Mirror. The Black Ick crisis was solved (for a while, at least) through Xipetotec trading her life, Ixtlilton his sight, Xochipilli his hearing and Xochiquetzal her voice, and the main cast have had to replicate the feat in miniature several times since (generally using eggs for the sacrifice). Smaller feats of magic, such as using Tlaloc's Tuning Fork, Xochiquetzal's ability to turn into a cloud of butterflies, and Kitty's magical warming garments (for the cold-blooded members of the cast to wear during winter) either don't use this rule or are so low in cost that it's not worth bringing up in dialogue.

<ul><li> Explicitly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TowerOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TowerOfGod">Tower of God</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Shinsu</a> is potentially limitless in power and potency, and can be created and destroyed. Killing, shrinking, even creating life are made possible. There's only one catch. To even gain control over one control unit of Shinsu, one needs to rigorously train for ten years. Every further technique used takes dozens of years to master. Some people aren't even capable of doing so, since Shinsu would instantly mangle their body. Why does it take so long? Because a single fuck-up with a greater amount of shinsu is enough to completely obliterate you. It's dangerous stuff, kids. Handle with caution.
<ul><li> This trope is later played with in regards to a technique known as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Shinsu Loops</a>", in which shinsu is concentrated into rings to aggregate more shinsu. Normally, no one bothers with this ability though, because the more shinsu is gathered, the less stable the loop gets and less shinsu is actually usable. It's the equivalent of a power which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment">doubles your strength at the cost of being able to use only half your strength</a>.

<ul><li> This is how Luckamancy works. Numbers are a law of the universe; if you roll a four-sided die a hundred times, it will come up each number twenty five times. Luckamancy can make it roll higher for a time, but only by stealing numbers from another die—typically one of your own, meaning that if you boost one of your side's units, another of your units is going to have a worse time of it. This usually still works in your favor, since you boost the critical battles and the numbers get stolen from less critical ones.
</li><li> Fate must obey the numbers as well, and works in a similar way to Luckamancy, just with more cheating. The more Fate has to cheat in order to put you on the correct path, the more numbers it has to steal from elsewhere, which means life gets much worse for everyone around you. The warlord Sylvia is a textbook example. She realized she was blessed by Fate and pretty much stopped making any attempt to stay alive. Arrows aimed at her were deflected in midair and her every attack hit. But her own allies around her had much worse luck, and the absolute second she was in a position her Fate could not protect her from, she was dusted. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Wanda</span> lasts longer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">because she refuses to fight her gruesome Fate</a> (whatever it is), but doesn't realize that the supposedly free <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Decryption</span> has the price of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">altering her fate entirely</a></em> until it's too late to save her from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">dying a completely mundane death of cave-in</a>.

Conservation of energy is due to time-invariance, so as long as physical constants don't change, it will exist.
</li><li> Technically, increasing entropy is a strict conservation law. If you kept track of all possible outputs for a given set of inputs, the total entropy would remain constant. It's just that it's effectively impossible to keep track of it all, so you have some set of "possible" outputs that includes the real set, and has higher entropy.
</li><li> Although, as the laws of thermodynamics are also technically just statistical laws, there is nothing in physics preventing it from happening, especially at the quantum level, but any large scale reduction of entropy is so vanishingly unlikely that its not worth discussing. Unless the universe was perfectly uniform, even more incredibly cold, and with no usable energy, aka maximum entropy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaturalEndOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaturalEndOfTime">heat death</a>.

</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoldenRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoldenRule">The Golden Rule</a> can be interpreted as an attempt to apply this law of physics to justice and ethics.
<ul><li> In Law Enforcement, this is called Fruit of the Poisoned Tree. If you obtained good evidence by illegal means (breaking into the accused's house found a key to a bus station locker (and after getting a warrant to search said locker) with the murder weapon, still covered in the victim's blood) then not only is the evidence illegal and can't be used in the case (the key), but evidence resulting from that evidence (the knife, the blood on the knife, the DNA comparison of the blood to the victim, ect). If you did not obtain the evidence legally, you can't use it. A crooked cop, even one who was totally correct, will always let the bad guy go..
</li></ul></li><li> Also on a physical level, athletes, especially Olympic-level. They can do what seem like superhuman feats of strength, agility, endurance, etc., but the cost is devoting massive amounts of time training for a specific event, and burn out later in life.
<ul><li> More generally, while any human is capable of performing similarly superhuman feats, untrained Muggles can only do so under great stress and at the cost of shutting down certain vital functions temporarily, as well as directly damaging their bodies.
</li></ul></li><li> In a meta example partially related to the above, to achieve anything in life it is necessary for certain things to be used to reach this point. To breathe you must expend the energy needed to inhale oxygen into your lungs, to become successful at something (without relying on luck-&gt;chaos-&gt;entropy) you must devote a large amount of time to study your chosen field et cetera.
</li><li> The meaning of the proverb "there's no such thing as a free lunch." The proverb itself dates back to the 19th century when bars and saloons lured customers in with the promise of free food. The food was free as long as you bought drinks and the use of salty foods (ham, cheese, oysters, etc) guaranteed the patrons would buy plenty of beers.
</li><li> Few things in this world are free. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">Money</a> being a key thing to get many of the things we desire. You can't get an HDTV or car without having the cash to give in return for ownership.
</li><li> Privileges at a workplace work the same way. In order to get a special privilege, you must be willing to get the work done to earn it in return.
<ul><li> The inverse is also true, because people who only make minimum wage at a job will frequently give minimum effort.
</li></ul></li><li> Anything where the costs are hidden or distributive:
<ul><li> One example are frequent shopper programs offered by chain stores or supermarkets. These programs offer benefits to those who enroll such as discounts on products. However, any money lost by the business from these discounts is usually passed onto other shoppers not enrolled.
</li><li> This is essentially the problem in any political debate about taxation, allocation of resources, or any other financial laws. For instance, "why should the rich pay so that the poor can have benefits?" or "why should an upper class be allowed to accumulate wealth and happiness at the expense of a lower class?" depending on your perspective.
