</li><li> Ellis in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ElCazadorDeLaBruja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ElCazadorDeLaBruja">El Cazador de la Bruja</a></em> asks Nadie to shoot her so she she can avoid being enslaved by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. Nadie does so and dies herself shortly thereafter of undisclosed reasons.

</li><li> At the very heart of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicKnightRayearth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicKnightRayearth">Magic Knight Rayearth</a>,</em> in which which the Pillar of Cephiro, who supports the stability and peace of her entire world, is no longer able to bear the burden of her responsibility. She must summon the Magic Knights from another world, for nobody in all Cephiro can kill the Pillar and it's impossible for the Pillar herself to take her own life. After learning of the true situation, the Knights reluctantly accept what must be done, setting the stage for a truly heart-breaking climax as well as for the second season, where the Knights must defend Cephiro from the foreigners who want to take over and become Pillars.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaReiZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaReiZero">Ga-Rei -Zero-</a></em> Yomi tries to do this to herself after realizing that she's been killing her friends out of hatred. The banestone in her prevents her from getting her own sword anywhere near herself to cause injury.
<ul><li> Yomi also repeatedly tells Noriyuki to kill her to prevent her from killing Kazuki. At first it seems like she might just be taunting him, until she starts crying while she screams this.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DescendantsOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DescendantsOfDarkness">Descendants of Darkness</a></em>, Tsubaki Kakyouin begs Hisoka to kill her after Muraki injures her fatally, since she (or better said, her alter-ego Eileen, created by another girl's anger at how she was murdered to give her heart to Tsubaki) is to blame for the murders that had just taken place, and she wants to die in peace. Hisoka tearfully complies to her wish and shoots her to death, then cries in Tsuzuki's arms.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TekkamanBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TekkamanBlade">Tekkaman Blade</a></em>, the main character has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HourOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HourOfPower">strict 30-minute timer on his battle form</a> before he loses his mind and becomes a savage destruction machine. Early in the series, he asks another member of the team (his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lancer">Lancer</a> in the group, Noel) to shoot him if he goes over.
</li><li> Very cruel example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em>: An Ansgard warrior named Volker abused his adoptive son Mime for years and once taunted him with the fact that he had killed Mime's biological parents, which sent Mime in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a> and made him his father. What seemed to be a case of revenge is actually one where Volker, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure">haunted for years</a> for <em>accidentally</em> killing Mime's parents during a civil war, wanted Mime to punish him. (Mime's dad was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">The Rival</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontYouDarePityMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontYouDarePityMe">refused to be spared because of his family</a>, and when Volker attacked him in self-defense, he hit both him <em>and</em> his wife who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoThroughMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoThroughMe">was trying to stop them</a>). Volker couldn't be easily killed by anyone in Ansgard since he was the top <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass">Retired Badass</a> there, so he played a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit">Thanatos Gambit</a> to have his wish to die honorably at the hands of someone who'd take his place in the top ten of Ansgard's military force, while also atoning for a double kill that he never truly intended to commit.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, this is the reason Kami trains Goku to kill Piccolo Jr. Since he and Piccolo are two halves of one being, if Piccolo dies, Kami will as well. Kami feels that he deserves to pay for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure">bringing Piccolo into the world in the first place,</a> but as a God, he can't kill himself.
</li><li> In the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, to keep the world form discovering that he is Zero <em>and</em> the Emperor, Lelouch asks his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Dragon</a> Suzaku to dress up as Zero and kill him <em>in public</em>. Suzaku tearfully does so, and after Emperor Lelouch is out of the picture in a very dramatic way, <em>he</em> becomes Zero and aids Lelouch's little sister and successor, Empress Nunnally. However... some fans keep insisting that Lelouch <em>may</em> be still alive and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth">Walking the Earth</a> with C.C.

Then it was announced that he was confirmed to be the main character in the sequel which is officially named "Lelouch of the Resurrection", which aligns with the mountain of official statements (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GeassedbyLelouch/comments/8hklfr/evaluating_code_theory_main_body_index/">database with official statements<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>)about his death.
</li><li> It's important to note that the hay cart scene in the epilogue, which is central in the fan theory, was dropped and replaced when they made the Zero Requiem blu-ray in 2009. Because this hay cart scene was so often misunderstood and misrepresented it was replaced by a <a class="urllink" href="https://streamable.com/d8dji">brand new epilogue<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in which C.C. narrates to the audience and explicitly explains that Lelouch is dead and that she mourns him, but she comforts herself with the thought that Lelouch died while achieving his goal of a gentler world, the Zero Requiem. this much clearer and much more explicit epilogue rules out the misinterpretation that Lelouch could have had the code.
</li><li> And let's not forget that this trope is the particular compulsion that Lelouch puts on Suzaku, sealing his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a> as well.

When confronted by a temporarily superpowered Lana Lang (who, pre-<em>Crisis</em>, he had some history with), Luthor valiantly struggles against Brainiac's control long enough to beg her: "kill me!", rather than remain the living computer's meat-puppet.

He does this in <em>private</em> though, so when it inevitably does the others think he still just wants to kill Angel.
<ul><li> Angel has pretty much asked this of anyone who's ever worked for/with him. Most of them kind of suck following through on it. Wesley is pretty much the only person Angel thinks might be able to follow through on this request and is one of the reasons Angel trusts him.
</li><li> In the first season, Faith asks Angel to kill her for realizing how cruel her actions really were. Angel refuses, and it works better for Faith.
</li><li> In the fifth season, Nina Ash initially refuses to be rescued by Angel. She has become a werewolf and nearly mangled her niece, so she considers herself a monster. But Angel can convince her that she can not help the werewolf's actions.

This appears to be purely a psychological effect rather than something hardwired into them — Brother Cavil, the one Cylon who doesn't believe in the Cylon god, is shot by the underground resistance on New Caprica in the third season, and, upon coming back sometime later, casually mentions that he had to cut his jugular vein open with a shell casing to kill himself. And he does it again in the final episode as well, shooting himself in the head after Tyrol makes resurrection impossible by killing another one of the Final Five. "Frak!" *bang* Keep in mind that "real death" is clearly regarded differently from being killed and resurrected. Once the resurrection ship is destroyed, Gina hands Baltar a pistol and tells him to shoot her, as suicide is a sin.

At the end of season four in "When the Levee Breaks", while suffering withdrawal from demon blood, Sam tells Bobby to shoot, moving the gun's muzzle to his own heart, if Bobby wants to help him.
<ul><li> Played straight in "Heart". Sam's one night stand was a werewolf, but they cured her... except not. There's no cure and she'd already killed a few people, so she asks Sam to shoot her instead. Ouch.

</li><li> Young Erasmus van Richten of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a></em> invoked this trope, begging his father Rudolph to drive a stake through his heart before vampirism could extinguish his compassion and make him a killer. Justified in that, while Erasmus could theoretically have committed suicide by sunlight, he was only a kid and probably couldn't have endured the 10 rounds of agony then required under D&amp;D rules.
</li><li> Dwarfs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> are an interesting example, in that their culture allows for death to atone for a terrible shame or failure, but is strictly opposed to killing oneself- according to some sources, dwarfs are mentally incapable of suicide. Instead, a suicidal Dwarf becomes a <em>Troll Slayer</em>, which mostly entails dyeing their hair and beard, cutting it into a mohawk, and going out to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">find something really nasty to kill them in battle</a>. And since Dwarfs are similarly opposed to throwing a fight, the more successful (or <em>un</em>successful, depending on how you look at it) Slayers are fearsome warriors indeed.
<ul><li> Amusingly enough, the normally-branching "career paths" detailed in the Warhammer RPG handbooks break down slightly for Trollslayers. A Trollslayer's only "exit career" is "Giantslayer," and a Giantslayer's only possible exit career is "Daemonslayer," each one describing a correspondingly higher level of Awesome. And under the listing for "exit careers" for Daemonslayers...? "A glorious death."

In HK-47's cut solo mission against the HK-50's, they would weaponize this by informing him over the intercom that various actions would be harming them, and thus himself as far as his programming was concerned. He'd eventually get around it, but only by disabling the intercom, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">wiping their messages from his memory</a> and then altering his programming to allow himself to harm them.

Since fal'Cie in general lack the free will to perform actions outside those predefined for them (hence the reason why l'Cie exist in the first place) and Cocoon fal'Cie cannot assign a Focus that would endanger Cocoon, they needed a Pulse fal'Cie, who could assign such a Focus without issue, to create l'Cie of its own to do the deed.

After breaking free, she walks towards Griffin. He tells her to stop, but, of course, she doesn't due to the fact that Griffin sent the security department way over budget after ordering a lift to be made on his office, so they disabled a few low-level overrides, such as "Griffin Alpha Zero", and Shinatama <em>wants</em> to die.

Of course, this is either wishful thinking or a hallucination - she then appears to have been tortured to the point she's in a psuedo-catatonic state, looks to have physically aged another 40 years, appears to be developing scaly skin like a Locust (depending on how you look at it) and is generally unresponsive to anything he does. "It's me, Dominic! It's Dominic!". Eventually he euthanises her.

Also, in <em>3</em>, there is one scene where one of Carlos's fellow U.B.C.S. members is infected and tries to convince him to kill him, which he finally does just as he starts to turn.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising">Dead Rising</a></em> has a scene to this effect. Brad ends up getting zombified in the most physically graphic way possible in the game (you can see the parasites eating his intestines). When Frank finds him Brad states "It doesn't even hurt..

</li><li> Fortune from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2">Metal Gear Solid 2</a></em> is unwilling to kill herself, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">wants to die</a> in a blaze of glory in a battle against Solid Snake, whom she blames for her father's death. Unfortunately, Fortune has an electro-magnetic device on her body without her knowledge that prevents her from ever dying in combat, and every grenade thrown at her is a dud. This is a major motivator behind her constant Wangst. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle">Boss Battle</a> against Fortune plays on this trope heavily; you spend it dodging her shots and taking cover until the timer runs out.

She is not allowed to kill herself, and she cannot tell Snake the truth about her mission. It speaks volumes about her strength of character that she does not angst about this in the slightest; in fact, she seems <em>glad</em> that Snake is the one to finally finish her.
</li><li> Vamp starts displaying signs of this trope in the fourth game, but it's not due to any sort of moral dilemma; he is <em>literally</em> unable to kill himself, since he instantly recovers from any wounds, due to nanomachines that enhance his natural <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>.

Even if you intentionally throw yourself of a cliff, Elika will save you and take you back to the last flat ground you stood on. Even when facing off with the dark god <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Ahriman</a> he cannot die because Elika will save him. It's even used as a story element at one point: the Concubine, after trying repeatedly and failing to seduce the Prince, finally resorts to using illusions to cause Elika to disappear, and then she summons many, many illusions of Elika and demands that the Prince choose the right one. But they're all fake: the correct choice is to throw yourself off the tower, because Elika will then be forced to save you. The Prince points out that he "hopes this works" as he does it, and Elika lampshades the insanity of his plan.

However, if the Courier chooses to remove him from his life support system, he begs the Courier to just kill him instead of leaving him alive, thus invoking the trope. The reason being, having been removed from his life-support pod and exposed to the various nasty diseases and radiations of the wastes (or at least those that could get into the basement of the Lucky 38), putting Mr. House back into the pod alive will leave him incapacitated and dying over the next 60 or so years.

However, in a cruel twist, he is unable control or do anything but stare at a wall for the 200 years since the bombs fell.

<ul><li> The case of Sue Rodriguez, a landmark decision in the Canadian euthanasia debate. Rodriguez suffered from ALS and feared that by the time she reached the point of wishing to die, she would be unable to carry it out herself; she took her case to the Supreme Court twice but was struck down both times. (She eventually died in 1994 with the assistance of an anonymous physician.)
</li><li> The case of Ramón Sampedro in Spain. He became paralyzed from the neck down after breaking his neck in an accident as a young man. Unable to commit suicide on his own, he spent years fighting for the right to assisted suicide, and was repeatedly denied by the Spanish government. He eventually died in 1998 with the help of friends, each of whom performed a single act so minor that they could not be charged with a crime.
</li><li> In a similar case, an American teacher and artist Christina Symanski, who became quadriplegic, losing the use of all limbs. She was denied euthanasia, so <a class="urllink" href="http://medicalfutility.blogspot.com/2012/02/christina-symanski-quadriplegic-starves.html">she starved herself to death.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> A talented UK rugby player, Daniel James, got similarly paralyzed in an accident.

</li></ul></li><li> While Seppuku is frowned upon now, there is still a large cultural mindset in Japan towards self-punishment for dishonor. Although it doesn't usually reach I Cannot Self-Terminate levels, it can result in an odd (for Westerners) predeliction towards redemption.
</li><li> The <em>kaishakunin</em> or "second" in a seppuku ritual has a role somewhere between this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Kill</a>. He decapitates the person committing seppuku after the cut is made, to kill the seppuku performer before the pain becomes so great that he cannot help but dishonor himself by showing pain.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseChristian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseChristian">There were quite a few Roman Catholic samurai during</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JidaiGeki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JidaiGeki">the Sengoku period</a>. They could not commit seppuku due to religious reasons even though it would be culturally appropriate to do so. The alternative is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop">suicide by enemy soldier</a>.
</li><li> In a weird way, this trope is why people get cancer. Normally, once a cell becomes cancerous (i.e. its DNA has mutated to the point where the cell cannot control its growth), the immune system will recognize that this has happened and will essentially force the cancerous cell to self-destruct. The Warburg Hypothesis is based on the observation that most tumor cells have damaged mitochondria, which then disables the cell's ability to destroy itself. As a result, it can continue to grow unabated and cause problems while the body's defenses are unable to stop it.
</li><li> A real life example, one of the theories behind the Malaysian phenomenon of "running amok," was that it was a suicide attempt. Because of the taboo towards suicide, a man would retain his honor by attacking as many people as he could until someone finally killed him, since he could not kill himself.
</li><li> The phenomenon of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop">police-assisted suicide</a>," in which people who can't bring themselves to end their own lives commit a violent crime, such as taking a hostage, in order to provoke the police into shooting them. Only officially considered "suicide" if the person left a note to that effect.

</li><li> When a cell in the human body is infected by a virus, the cell will chop the virus up and stick the pieces out on its surface, couched inside proteins that basically say "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieInfectee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieInfectee">Hey killer T-cells, this thing is inside me,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">please kill me</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypticLog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypticLog">record who did it."</a>
