Some are easy. Some are moderately hard. Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">are hated by many people for being too damn hard.</a> But some have a really easy way to beat them. A level that would normally take an hour to beat or high effort. But if you Google the level, stuff will come up, namely, people claiming that they beat it in 10 minutes tops. Tricks may include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">exploiting glitches or flaws</a>. If a target time or score is far too good to get the conventional way, the game could be hinting that this method exists.
</p><p>Some players feel that this method of clearing a level isn't considered "truly" beating it, or call it outright cheating. Sometimes this is acknowledged in-game due to the trick skipping items that are part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>, but in other games skipping the level makes no difference at all.

<ul><li> The infamous Water Temple features a trick that lets you bypass the locked center room door: after draining all the water, you can jump from the entrance and land on the middle ledge, then light the torch to open the door into the center room.
</li><li> The Spirit Temple also has a sliding climbable wall, with spikes on both sides. Obviously a painful timing puzzle, right? Nope, just Longshot your way up to the top section!
</li></ul></li><li> Defied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em> and its Roll Goal mini-game. It's possible, via building momentum, to "jump" the ball across gaps and reach the goal in spite of skipping large portions of the maze, but Hena will fail you anyways, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">pointing out that you didn't technically complete the whole maze</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors">Hyrule Warriors</a></em>:
<ul><li> The "Guard the allied keeps with your life!" missions become incredibly easy in Legends and Definitive Edition if you give your fairy the Repair Technician skill and use it in an otherwise problematic keep, allowing you to mop up the enemies you need to kill as the mooks fail to take down the fortified keep.
</li><li> The "All Attacks are Devastating!" missions are often seen as extremely difficult... until one realizes that your bow is just as devastating. Simply target an officer, let fly, and move on.
</li><li> Likewise, in the "All Attacks are Devestating!" missions and the "X Rule: Don't Get Hit!" missions, you can use a weapon with the Regen skill, which slowly regenerates your health. Because of your Last Chance Hit Point, even one heart per second of regen is invaluable. It's even more useful in "Definitive Edition" thanks to the Damage Taken score recalculation.
</li><li> And speaking of Regen, it works all the time, even in "No Healing" missions.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em>: Yiga Clan members in their base giving you hell with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> attacks, not to mention that you're completely potato at stealth? There are two tricks to this: you can A. toss a banana in a Blademaster patrol's path and scoot off as they scoot off to devour the fruit, or B. craft some Ancient Arrows after activating the Akkala Tech Lab, draw aggro on a patrol, then insta-kill the Blademasters before they can do so to you.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderIII">Tomb Raider III</a></em> level, Thames Wharf, requires Lara to spend an hour traversing a complex series of underground puzzles in order to get from the roof of one building to the roof of another. Or she can just, ya know, jump across and be done in ten seconds flat.
<ul><li> There are many more, if less blatant examples of this in the early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider">Tomb Raider</a></em> series, due to the compact nature of the levels and a simple but very consistent engine that treats every surface the same. Many a custom level designer can attest to that the tiniest oversight might result in an unintended shortcut.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnterTheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnterTheMatrix">Enter the Matrix</a></em>, one level has you evading an army of Smith clones around a city. However the entire level can be bypassed simply by heading right at the start of the level instead of left, as the game tells you.
</li><li> The 2001 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrJekyllAndMrHyde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrJekyllAndMrHyde">Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</a></em> PC game had a trick where if you left the room after encountering the final boss, he'd de-spawn, allowing you to beat the game easily.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodzillaMonsterOfMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodzillaMonsterOfMonsters">Godzilla: Monster of Monsters</a></em> has two very well known tactics that make the levels <em>much</em> easier:
<ul><li> Purposely killing off Mothra on your first turn. Yes, she is such a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone">millstone</a> that the game is <em>easier</em> without her. Sure it means being ganged up on in later levels, but Godzilla levels up faster if he's the only monster so it balances itself out.
</li><li> Letting enemies attack you. Normally when you move beside an enemy you're given the option to fight them, and if you say yes you'll do battle with them at the end of the stage. If you choose no, this will force the enemy to waste their turn simply to start the battle you didn't start during your turn. You still fight the enemy as normal, but now when the fight ends (either when you win or if the fight times out) it's your turn: this means you can move a space away and back to replay a level and replenish health before continuing the fight, and it also means another enemy can't move in to declare an attack and beat your weakened self down. It also means Varan, Baragon, and Hedorah can't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">"retreat to the next field"</a> if the battle is going in your favor, since they can only do this if the fight times out and it's the enemy's turn. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is basically the only way to defeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss">King Ghidorah</a>, since he loves to trap you in the corner and just drain away all of your health and replaying levels between battles to restore yourself is your only option to survive</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TokyoJungle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TokyoJungle">Tokyo Jungle</a>:</em> In Act 12 of the story mode, as a Tosa (dog breed) you try to reclaim your territory from the hyenas. All the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">lions</a> and hyenas on the map will attack you, and eventually you come up on a pack fighting an old, scarred lion, and <strong>both</strong> animals will attack you. You get to the boss, and he runs, leaving you to fight two mini-bosses. Defeat them, and you have to fight a sabertooth tiger boss, which can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfHurting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfHurting">spam it's powerful special attack if you fail to dodge it even once.</a> Defeat it, and you finally get to face the final boss for this mission...which is a over-powered hyena, but if you don't beat him in one try, you have to fight the sabertooth again! This mission, while it still can be frustratingly difficult because of all the bosses, gets much more doable if you realize you can just simply and easily run past many of the hyenas and lions without fighting them, stop next to a carcass for a few minutes for food and to let your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualRegeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualRegeneration">health replenish when you've been damaged</a>, find a secret, hidden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingPotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingPotion">Pet Medicine</a> on a balcony, and eat the sabertooth for another secret <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingPotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingPotion">Pet Medicine</a>.

With practice, you can use this in the rally races without triggering the '5 second penalty' for heavy contact. The technique falls just outside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> territory, as not many turns on the tracks actually have walls, so you'll still need to drive properly most of the time (tough luck for those stuck on the Nurburgring challenges).

It's a standard Dragon Ball <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest">Fetch Quest</a> mission, except that rather than dealing with hordes of enemies, this one only has one opponent: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">Broly</a>, which means it's worth a lot of XP. Additionally, mirroring the plot of <em>Second Coming</em>, the player will quickly get support from Videl, Trunks, Goten, and finally Gohan. Broly will <strong>always</strong> go after one of these four first, meaning he won't attack the player unless the player makes a nuisance of himself. This means that all one has to do is retrieve the three Dragon Balls as quickly as possible while completely ignoring Broly, which will end the mission and rake in tons of XP, especially thanks to the bonuses earned for not taking damage and completing the mission quickly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></em> has two World of Light battles that can be done much easier than intended:
<ul><li> The first is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Snorlax</a>, a fight against a completely passive, but giant King K. Rool with 500HP, regeneration, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">a one-minute time limit</a>. The enemy won't move in any way except to avoid drowning, so this is usually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">straight DPS check</a>... or you can throw him onto Kapp'n's boat when it appears. The giant hitbox touches the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RingOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RingOut">blast line</a> before the AI thinks to jump off. (This one was fixed in a later patch.)
</li><li> Another is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">The Imprisoned</a>, a giant, passive King K. Rool (again). Less HP this time, but after a few moments, a Ghirahim assist trophy spawns to attack you. You can either dodge the attacks and focus on K. Rool, knock out Ghirahim for a few moments of peace... or charge straight at K. Rool with Bowser, who can push him off the stage before Ghirahim even spawns.
</li></ul></li><li> In numerous Arcade and SNES-era <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em> games, you could land two or three free uppercuts on your opponent by just crouching. They would, without fail, just walk within range and take the hit a couple of times before changing tactics and instead keeping their distance, but a couple of uppercuts is a pretty savage chunk of their health bar to lose making the battle much easier.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueCentralFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueCentralFiction">BlazBlue: Central Fiction</a></em>: The boss version of Hakumen in Grim of the Abyss mode can use his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack">Astral Finish</a> whenever he likes, which basically means that any time you attack him there is a risk he will intercept it with a counter that causes him to automatically win. However, grab attacks cannot be countered, so abusing your grab makes the fight massively easier. This is especially good for characters like Platinum and Bullet who have dash attacks that end in grabs, making it easy to close the gap. Alternatively, with a bit of luck/grinding, you can find the Grimoire skill that <em>disables your enemy's ability to use Astrals</em>.

The Covenant will begin maneuvering once you get close enough to the mass driver, regardless of whether or not you are in it. Your objective also only mandates that you kill the cruiser. So, use the mass driver for cover until the cruiser is in position. Then hop inside it and take out the cruiser with one shot, rather than subjecting yourself to the storm of Covenant aircraft.

Simply run ahead until you reach the safe area where the amoebas cannot reach you, and wait there for Miller to show up. He's tough and has a great weapon, so he'll most likely survive. With the hard part out of the way, all that remains is to use the crane, and then you've won.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam">Serious Sam</a></em> games were full of these. There are any number of levels where you can avoid the big climactic fight, or at least make it a hell of a lot easier, by either rocket-jumping to an inaccessible ledge, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishingForMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishingForMooks">running off to a great distance so the huge crowd of enemies comes after you in a long, thin, easy-to-pick-off stream instead of converging on you all at once</a>.

<ul><li> While not exactly easy to pull off, it's possible to beat Aztec level without killing Jaws and without even operating the open/close exhausting bay terminal. If the player attracts the yellow jump-suited guards in the corridor between the room with the terminal behind the glass doors and the exhaust bay and returns to the room and hides in the back, it's possible that the guards will open the glass doors and Bond can use the guidance data and recover the launch protocol and finish the mission in any place within the level (even in the exhaust bay), as the level has no defined exit. It's not quite clear if this is a glitch or not as the level normally has no exit too. This trick is very popular among speed run players.

However, A glitch exists where the player can in the beginning of the level either trigger the alarm (a convenient button on a nearby wall) or use the stun or dart function of Bond's watch on a bank guard or a civilian, collect the equipment and walk out of the bank with a "mission cleared" in under 20 seconds.
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoOneLivesForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoOneLivesForever">No One Lives Forever</a></em>, you had to fight the burly Magnus Armstrong... with just your fists. The trick is to wait until he slams the ground for an AOE attack, run up to him, and jump on top of him. He won't move (because you are already next to him) but won't be able to reach you, either, with his fists. You, on the other hand, will be able to hit him if you duck—one boss down.

<ul><li> The first mission (Liberty Island) can be skipped less than three minutes in by picking up a gas grenade (which is conveniently located in a crate right near the entrance to the UNATCO base) and throwing it at the base's front door, which causes a guard to run out and investigate what's going on while you walk in unchallenged. The game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">actually acknowledges</a> this possibility.

</li><li> When you first arrive in Hong Kong, instead of looking for Gordon Quick, you can walk over to Tonnochi Road, use LAM-jumping to get to a high-up walkway, kill Maggie Chen with a GEP rocket from outside her window (resolving an entire quest chain), break into the MJ12 facility from the top floor, take the Dragon's Tooth Sword and return it to Max Chen at the Lucky Money to finish the entire questline in the area.

</li><li> Nova Prospekt in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em> has three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine">Hold the Line</a> segments, and while the first and third are manageable the second is a nightmare that can easily overwhelm a player who isn't constantly vigilant throughout the whole thing. Thus an array of alternate strategies emerged, like bringing more turrets from the earlier segment, stacking boxes in front of some of the entrances to restrict enemy movement, or literally hiding in a cupboard and waiting until they go away. Most recently, the strategy used is to <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/d9x5Sc05K4o?t=3983">shove yourself through the floor with a turret<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

The items of desire are incredibly heavy, slowing anyone carrying them down to an ungodly pace. Forklifts nearby can be used to move the cases a bit faster, but even then it'll take numerous trips to secure six of the cases, and even more for all eight. Easily-missable is a muscle car hanging out nearby, which the group can commandeer to make the job of moving the items much faster. Lampshaded with an achievement received for finishing the job without using the car: "There Was A Car?!"

The exit switch is hidden in the floor, and is supposed to rise out after you trigger four switches throughout the level. However, the pseudo-3D <em>Doom</em> engine does not take the Z dimension into account when deciding whether a switch is in the player's reach, so if you simply face towards where the switch is and press the Use key, the level ends.

Normally you have to get off of whatever piece of building you're standing on and fight some enemies before you can get through to the next section, but the last chunk of the factory can be bypassed if you just stay in a house as it's being built. It makes great cover, you don't need to get out, and other than turning a little, doesn't encounter any hazards.

Or, you could target him from a distance and send a hunter or warlock's pet up (since NPCs can climb walls PCs can't) and pull him down the hill to be killed at leisure. Several other dungeons and raids have similar gauntlets that can be bypassed in this manner, some 'fixed', some not.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a> Factions</em>, the Gyala Hatchery mission reqires players escort a group of turtle hatchlings while defending them from waves of enemies, with the number of surviving turtles determining the rewards. Quickly leaving the start area prevents the escort starting and the players can then clear the majority of enemy spawns without endangering the turtles. However, while this method makes it easier to <em>win</em>, it's arguable as to whether or not it's an easier way to play the mission itself, as it's much more time-consuming and requires some planning due to lacking the NPC reinforcements.
<ul><li> <em>Prophecies</em> has a number of instances, likely due to the first campaign being not as tightly designed.
<ul><li> The Nolani Academy mission has a lengthy segment where Prince Rurik must be escorted and protected from a large number of random enemies and later a large Charr army. However there is a fork in the road where Rurik goes one direction and will stop in a safe spot if not followed. The players can then proceed down the other path which skips nearly the entirety of the remaining enemies and leads straight to the final boss, whose death ends the level.
</li><li> The final battle in the Dunes of Despair can be made much easier while at the same time completing one of the hardest bonus objectives. Ordinarily the players must defend a fortress from waves of Forgotten attackers and siege worms until a timer ends. However it's possible using a specific set of skills and weapons to get the entire party outside the fortress before the gates open. The players can then kill all of the Forgotten mobs, complete the bonus objective, and map the ordinarily inaccessible area without any time constraints. As a result the only enemy to worry about once the siege starts are the worms.
</li><li> The Augury Rock mission consists of a fight against a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorBoss">Mirror Boss</a>.

The easiest strategy to beat it requires casting only one skill and then just standing still why the boss kills itself.
</li><li> The Ice Caves of Sorrow has a segment where the player is intended to be running from a large group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Mursaat</a> while fighting through large groups of White Mantle and Stone Summit. However the Mursaat follow a set path and can be triggered while the players are in a safe spot; the Mursaat will eliminate most of the Stone Summit before dying to siege weapon fire, leaving players to clear a scattering of White Mantle.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Eye of the North</em> the Genius Operated Living Enchanted Manifestation mission involves protecting kilns from waves of Destroyers. If the players avoid the kilns at the start of the level the waves will not trigger, allowing players to clear a majority of the level's enemies at their own pace. Once the static spawns are removed, the kilns are activated and it's a trivial matter to eliminate the spawning waves.

<ul><li> A common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> on early pinball machines? Picking them up. Since pinball's a physical game, this meant that moving the machine could move the ball where a player wanted it to go. This led to pinball machine makers to make their machines too heavy to pick up, and introducing the "tilt" mechanic which is an instant ball loss if the machine is moved too violently.
<ul><li> Another common trick that works well with most modern games is to complete a difficult mode or objective by stacking it with a Multiball. With more balls in play simultaneously, not only does it make it easier to complete said objective, but it also widens the margin of error significantly, since you remain alive as long as at least one ball is in play. Some games, like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/MonsterBash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/MonsterBash">Monster Bash</a></em>, even encourage this tactic by stopping all active mode timers whenever a Multiball mode is running, giving you as much time as you need to complete them as long as you can keep at least two balls in play.

Or, you can glitch through a door by using Silver's telekinesis on a crate, and skip the puzzle entirely.
</li><li> For Rouge's segment in End of the World, you can skip the entire level by climbing and flying from pillar to pillar to the end.

<ul><li> The final section of Sonic's Lost World can be defeated by spin dash jumping after the first wall tile puzzle (it will leave you standing at the switch to trigger the ring chain to light dash to the end).
</li><li> Large swaths of Ice Cap with Sonic can be cut out by using some creative jumping (the first area can be passed by dash jumping on top of the archway leading into the first cave up to the rocket and with some very precise jumping, you can reach the switch to activate the thin bridge in the second area).

<ul><li> In the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaDreamcast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaDreamcast">Sega Dreamcast</a> version, performing a Spiral Upper as Knuckles or Screw Kick as Rouge would "suck in" all objects within a certain radius of the character - including Master Emerald shards, keys and Chaos Emeralds, even if they weren't accessible. This saved a lot of time on stages that had shards etc. inside containers that couldn't be broken open normally, especially in Security Hall - normally you would have to find out which floor the safe is on that you want to open, go up to where the switches are and press the correct colour-coded switch, then go back down and dig in the middle of the safe to open it. With this trick, however, just stand in front of the safe where the Emerald is and Screw Kick to instantly get it. This glitch was fixed in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a> and HD remake versions of the game.
</li><li> "Hard Mode" of Knuckles and Rouge's stages, while featuring more enemies and obstacles, always had the items in the same places every time. As such, once a player knew where the items were, it just became a matter of getting to them and grabbing them as fast as possible; in effect, the "Hard Mode" stages were easier than the normal stages.

It's considered one of the harder levels in the game because of this, although a shortcut leading to just before the end of the stage exists, simply by going left and back into the entrance immediately at the start.

The springs launch you toward the ceiling when you step on them, making the section rather difficult, but if you just use the dash feature you bounce from spring to spring avoiding enemies and zooming past the lasers, landing at the end without a scratch. You can also use the supercharged C. Sting weapon to become temporarily immune to damage and quickly pass through.
</li><li> <em>MDK 2</em> has one in Max's final stage. The next-to-last section before the boss involves climbing up a large tower by using the self-recharging jetpack Max just got to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">very carefully</a> land on outcroppings from the tower.

For the intentional kind, the first Chain Chomp mission in Bob-omb Battlefield can be beaten by ground pounding the post three times and avoiding its attacks... or you could just run straight through the fence behind it with Luigi's vanish cap ability. Or just smash the post in one hit as an invincible Mega Mario/whoever equivalent. For every other mission in the game, the 'easy trick' was simply to use Luigi and backflip, since it basically let you glide gently down to just about anywhere from a high enough pointer.

The Goal Pole is up on a cliff right in front of you, and you must dive into the water below it to swim through a cave network to reach the top of it... Or with a Tanooki Suit (or even some skillful regular jumping), you can just scrape over the top of the cliff from the start point and finish the course in under 10 seconds.

Turns out you can tap other things as well to make a level or part easier. Flipswitch puzzles not your cup of tea? Just tap the switches instead of hopping around on them! Tired of chasing bunnies around? Tap them to make them stop! Venus Fire Trap bothering you? Tap a fireball to reflect it back! Etcetera, etcetera.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a></em> has 4-3.

However, a very easy workaround for this restriction is to use invisible blocks and doors and/or pipes to create a hidden path to the exit that only the level creator could expect to know about, dubbed a "dev exit", while the rest of the stage is either obscenely difficult to complete or outright impossible. This is such a well-known exploit that most players know to check the beginning of the stage for such exits, and some developers even add trick dev exits to levels just to troll people looking for them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em> has quite a few:
<ul><li> The notoriously difficult volleyball mini game. In normal gameplay, it can be a bit of a pain given how far the ball flies after every hit and how you need 100 points for an extra Power Moon. However, if you use Cappy on his own when playing via co-op mode (and leave Mario off the side of the court), then it becomes an absolute cinch, since Cappy is about twice as fast as Mario and can easily reach the ball at any point in the game.
</li><li> Another infamous mini game is the jump rope in New Donk City, which also requires a full 100 jumps to get the moon. This is normally exceedingly difficult, not only due to its unforgiving nature, but because it is very easy to throw off the rhythm by accidentally entering into a double jump. The solution? Do it on a moped, which has the exact same jump no matter how hard you tap the button. The hardest part is lining it up in a good position to start the game, but once you do, it's a cakewalk.
</li><li> It also has one of these in every Koopa race in the game. Whether it's an alternate route, a handy enemy to Capture or obvious shortcuts the Koopas don't take, there's always a sure fire way to win by a country mile. This is especially obvious in the Snow Kingdom, where despite the Koopas racing round a somewhat lengthy track with various obstacles, the simplest path is merely to jump off a cliff, then bolt across the freezing water at full speed towards the goal beacon, taking advantage of the handy tornado placed right below the cliff with the finish line.
</li><li> One glitch allows you to abuse the physics of Mario's frog capture to bypass the entire final <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel">Brutal Bonus Level</a>, though this glitch was fixed in an update. It's still possible, however, to bypass a large chunk of the stage, including the most difficult section, with some skillful Glydon flying.

However some enemies (usually Shy Guys) will turn into Lucky Fruits if you ground pound near them while you are Super Happy from eating 6 of the same fruit in a row. Level 6-3 "Ghost Castle" is normally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">one of the hardest levels in the game</a>, it features lots of Boo enemies that chase you and lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit">Bottomless Pits</a>. However the room right after the second Miss Warp which is in the second area of the level has a bunch of Mini Boos that turn into Lucky Fruits when you are Super Happy, and there is even a hidden Super Happy Fruit in the level you can get by ground pounding on a very obvious spot! If you turn Super Happy in this room by eating six Lucky Fruits or by using the hidden Super Happy Fruit you can get all 30 fruits in one ground pound! Plus since you just ate 30 of the same fruit in a row and it was the Lucky Fruit worth lots of points, your score will be good too!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong94" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong94">Donkey Kong '94</a></em> has objects that can be temporarily placed around the field when Mario touches their default location. If part of the object is placed over a gate, it will jam the gate open if it's trying to close. There are several levels where the level can be made much simpler by quickly grabbing a temporary object as the level starts and making sure a gate stays open, or making a switch that controls multiple gates have one particular gate stay open. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This might have been intentional - a much later level <em>requires</em> the player to do the same thing to another door controlled by a lever.</span>

Later games <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">disable jumping when on a vehicle</a> to prevent this.

The natural choice is to bring Baby Mario for his speed boost, especially given the setpiece's similarity to World 1-3. However, it's far easier to with Baby Peach - her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParasolParachute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParasolParachute">Parasol Parachute</a> makes the precision jumps much easier, and while the ball will get extremely close it can't catch you as long as you keep moving. It also reduces the player's feeling of being rushed, which also helps with the jumping.

You have to get 20 (later, 40, 60 and 80) lemmings down from a height with only diggers; the canonical solution is to click on every lemming, and try again if you miss even one. The shortcut is to turn the release rate to about 30 and make one lemming dig a single pixel after the previous one, releasing him and making a step that the lemmings can walk down. The single-pixel requirement is tough, but you can keep trying with the next pair of lemmings without having to restart, so it's still much, much easier than the normal solution.

</li><li> "Not Your Typical Sushi Bar": Rather than jumping from conveyor belt to conveyor belt by manipulating various safes via the provided dimensions, it's possible to stand on top of one while it's rising. When you hit the roof, the safe squeezes to the side, causing it to move horizontally toward the exit, and can be rode there safely.
</li><li> "Through The Glass Flooring": Rather than collecting various extra dimensions to form a floating bridge from safes, the nearby support beams have one-inch ledges you can safely stand on. By jumping to this ledge, and edging along it, you can reach the same destination while eliminating much of the busy work.
</li><li> "Choose Wisely": Rather than collecting all four batteries so you can activate the two buttons, select the Fluffy Battery at the start. Place a safe against the wall near the vertical conveyor belts and another against a stud in the wall near the fan, before switching to Normal. Use Fluffy to place the first safe on the nearby button and immediately switch to Normal; the safe near the fan will have been blown down the hall and land on the button.

As such, a lot of 'base vs base' missions could be won simply by building a wall across the map from your base to theirs, and then using more walls to seal the enemy inside their own base.

<ul><li> In an early allied level you had an hour and a half to destroy a giant Soviet mind control device in Chicago. It starts with some jet pack troopers and some assault ships. The jet packers are to destroy two artillery batteries to let the destroyers past. The destroyers are then supposed to clear the ground for a base. But the device could be attacked by the destroyers and skip the base building.
</li><li> The second-to-last Soviet level where the enemy has control of half the map and is constantly attacking you, and also hax mind control units. You start off with a few Kirovs, giant blimps with lots of hit points. To win, you only had to destroy the Kremlin, and the top left line of the map had little anti-air defense. If you wish to preserve your base, a second tactic involves sending out your entire starting force to destroy the first enemy base to the east (including the nuclear plants powering most of the enemy's defenses on the map), and using your Kirovs to make the main pass to your base impassible by having them bomb the site indefinitely. Then you can build up your forces at your leisure, as the stakes have been dropped from a continual pounding of three-to-one to two-to-one, who can't even get their forces to reach your base. Yet another trick involved placing Tesla coils on the cliffs directly north of your base early (typically by sacrificing your Kirovs to destroy the enemy ones in place), which pick off most attackers with relative ease.
</li><li> An Allied mission protecting Einstein's lab has three soviet MCVs roll onto the map accompanied by troops. By quickly telling your starting troops to intercept the MCVs at the very start of the mission, it's possible to take out at least two of them, if not all three, right away.
</li><li> One Soviet mission requires you to defeat invading Korean forces. However, if you're fast, you can intercept their MCVs before they even set up a base.
</li><li> The last allied mission: You need to take out 4 elite level apocalypse tanks, 2 AA canons, two tesla coils and 2 sentry guns., while being attacked by huge waves of tanks supported by an Iron Curtain (make vehicles temporary invulnerable) and a nuclear silo. The range of an IFV loaded with Chrono-Legionaries is slightly greater than that of the Apocalypse tanks, and once you get your first shot with those babies, enemies are helpless until rescued or killed, and prism tanks work wonder against stationary defense. So 3 IFV + 3 chrono legionaries + 1 prism tank + 1 chronosphere = easy win.
</li><li> In the <em>Yuri's Revenge</em> expansion, the second Soviet mission can be won in under five minutes. According to the mission briefing, after some Allied chokepoints are fried, you need to set up base and fight your way to Einstein's lab and blow it up. In truth, take the troops you are given as soon as you get control, hug the right, then bottom sides of the map, and head for the bottom left, until you see some roads leading to some hilly areas. Go up those roads, right past three Allied bases, and the only things guarding Einstein's lab are a Mirage Tank and maybe some soldiers. Just cap them in the face and shoot the lab to win in under 3-5 minutes as opposed to the PAR time of an hour and a half.
</li><li> The final Allied mission of the same expansion involves Yuri having access to both Allied and Soviet superweapons, which lets him destroy your Construction Yard in one hit. Rather than having to prevent this or rebuild the Conyard, the Prima strategy guide recommends letting him fire the superweapons and then using a Chrono Legionnaire unit on your own Construction Yard - units that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone">are in the process of being erased from history</a> can't be harmed. The weapons hit, kill the Chrono Legionnaire and the Conyard reverts to existence unharmed. Rinse and repeat until you've taken out the superweapons.

<ul><li> Soviet mission 3, where you normally need to chase an enemy spy all across the map before <em>finally</em> cornering and killing him. The secret is that your attack dog units run faster when an enemy is targeted — so fast, in fact, that they can catch the spy within seconds of the mission starting. (Of course, the victory cutscene still shows the spy dying to a firing squad.) Alternatively you can use the long-range grenade glitch to destroy the structure the spy is hiding in without triggering the scripted event of the spy fleeing to the next part of the map. This causes the spy to enter the map from the east, with your soldiers right in his path.
</li><li> Soviet mission 5 requires you to destroy an Allied base sans a Radar structure, which you have to capture, and then destroy all Allied units and buildings remaining. Problem is there is a huge island full of resources and the Allies will ship off an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseOnWheels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseOnWheels">MCV</a> onto that if the player builds a submarine production structure or closes in with tanks. Once the island is fortified, the Soviets have almost no way to destroy the sprawling base except with heavy losses when landing. OR they build an airfield to paradrop some infantry on the island, wait for the MCV to land and abuse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> from the 5 soldiers with assault rifles to destroy the MCV before it can unpack and become a problem. Cleaning up after that is very easy.
</li><li> The last Soviet mission has another one, though it's really more a requirement for some. Since the Allies constantly get reinforcements by sea landing at 3 beaches and those units immediately home in on your base (in fact, 2 of the beaches are right next to it), the player constantly has to deal with pesky artillery and other things. Unless the adjacent building mechanic gets abused via building long chains of ore silos to base crawl to the beaches and then build a sea wall out of submarine factories, which works since the Allied transports delivering the units are unarmed. Side effect is that the amount of structures required for it to work also makes submarines take less than a second to produce.
</li></ul></li><li> The final mission of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EmperorBattleForDune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EmperorBattleForDune">Emperor: Battle for Dune</a></em> would normally require simultaneously fending off three enemy bases while mounting an offensive on the mission structure located past a narrow canyon jam-packed with powerful defenses. Alternatively, you can simply produce a group of Fremen stealth troops, move them straight past enemy lines, have them attack the target, then position them out of range of its slow-firing defensive cannon, move them back to attack, then rinse and repeat to win.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedAlert3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedAlert3">Red Alert 3</a></em>: One Imperial mission starts you with Yuriko and a few guards to retake the city of Yokohoma, which then turns into a brutal (and <em>timed</em>, for that extra middle-finger flavor) mission where the Allies send high-end units pouring into your badly-defended and overextended base. You can, however, send Yuriko into the Allied base <em>before</em> rescuing the Imperial buildings, as the Allies don't build anything before then. Go around defenses, take out the generators, and you can even take out the Soviets that pop up halfway through without too much trouble.

By sending most of your citizens to claim territories and build universities early in the game, you can ensure that your units will have a technological advantage by the time they meet (sending planes against a medieval city is not an uncommon occurence), and continuously producing units will let you dogpile enemy armies with relative ease (especially since multiple territories increases your population cap.

However, if you know that there is a placeholder unit hidden on the map, you can break the script and skip the fight with the Roman army.
<ul><li> In the Montezuma campaign, there's a mission where you're supposed to sneak about Tenochtitlan before raising an army to break in and destroy the wonder the Spanish are building in the occupied city.

Ordinarily, part of the difficulty is that your forces are woefully poorly developed; usually you can only field infantry and light vehicles. However, it's possible to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">hold off doing the mission</a> until you have Siege Tanks, whose artillery cannon will cheerfully chew up the entire attacking army, bit by bit, or mass Reapers, who do <em>horrible</em> things to both units like zombies and the structures they spawn from.
</li><li> "The Dig" is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine">Hold the Line</a> mission where you have to protect a laser drill until it tears down the Xel'Naga temple's gates from two heavily defended Tal'darim bases. These Tal'darim bases launch increasingly stronger attacks, eventually sending several late-tech units while your only heavy-damage unit by then tends to be the Siege Tank (which has only just been introduced), requiring using the drill to take out the strongest units (while making the mission last longer). This mission gets almost entirely trivialized by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">Sequence Breaking</a> and waiting until you can field Ghosts or Spectres with the permanent cloak upgrade. The Tal'darim never bring Detectors in their attack waves, so a row of these cloaked units easily walls off (and kills) everything they can bring bar Colossi or air units, which can be handled by Missile Turrets, Marines and Marauders without much issue.

Time elapsed: less than a minute.

Whilst you could build up your base defences and hope that your ally survives, you can instead train a few rocks (aerial transport units), load up your workers and mission-critical heroes, and fly off to your ally. Once there, you will be out of reach of the titan and as an added bonus, the enemy attacking your ally is also allied with you, and the way to your ally's base is through a narrow mountain pass that can conveniently be walled off.

However, it's possible to just run the entire starting army up through the city, ignoring all enemies, to gain vision inside the citadel. Then, rather than trying to break down the huge gates, it's possible to use every summon power inside the citadel, and use all the short-term super strong summons to break down the objective. Total time: about 5 minutes instead of 45.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomeTotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomeTotalWar">Rome: Total War</a></em>, the campaign AI will sometimes move the entire garrisoning army of a city save one unit <em>just</em> outside of the city. (It is unknown as to exactly why it does this.) This presents an interesting opportunity should you have a nearby army of your own with some artillery and/or a spy in the city who can open the gates for you. When you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StormingTheCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StormingTheCastle">assault the city</a>, the enemy's main force will appear as reinforcements on the very edge of the battle map while you are free to position your troops much closer to the city. Simply storm in and capture the town square from the one unit remaining in defense. If you're quick enough, you can capture the city and win the battle by holding the town square without ever engaging in the enemy's larger force. It will still be treated as a loss by that larger force and they'll be forced to back away from your newly won city on the campaign map. This strategy allows massive cities which normally take 30-45 minutes to capture at the cost of many troops to be captured in about <em>five</em> minutes with minimal casualties.

There are two things that make this considerably easier, though. First, the splinter dreadnoughts are mutually hostile and the enemy takes a while to build up any forces that can take them on, just leave a few alive and they'll hold the points for you just fine. Second, the substrate nexus is within artillery range of your own HQ area and the Substrate can't repair building HP. A radar upgrade and a line of long-range turrets will result in the Nexus being gradually beaten down with minimal effort.

<ul><li> It is possible to export characters into a file and later load it for new playthroughs, so that you won't have to roll again all the stats. Alternatively, you can directly import a character from a savegame. However, the latter method imports the XP and the items of the character as well. It is quite easy to leave Candlekeep with a level 10 fighter wielding +3 weapons and armours...
<ul><li> If you use modifications like Baldur's Gate Tu Tu or Trilogy, which import the whole content of the first game into its sequel and allows a continuous playthrough from Candlekeep to the end of the saga, you will also get the XP cap limit and the weapons of Baldur's Gate II with its expansion pack. You can then go straight to the endgame boss of Baldur's Gate and solo him in a few minutes with a lv40 godlike character wielding nuclear weapons... not talking about all previously powerful monsters, dragons, demons and undeads, now reduced to silly kittens. To a good extent, even the endgame boss of Shadows of Amn becomes terribly easy with a character from the end of Throne of Bhaal.
</li></ul></li><li> When you end the Prologue, you find yourself in the wilderness with no money and no valuable weapons. Hidden in a tree on the road where you start Chapter 1, you can find a diamond that boosts a lot your cash. It is normally hard to detect and acts as a quasi-easter egg for those obsessive players that click every pixel hoping to find something. The trick comes with the Enhanced Edition, where you can press a button to show if there are crates or other selectable objects in the map, thus allowing everybody to discover quite easily the diamond.
</li><li> Most enemies have spells encoded on items that have limited timers, so by not pausing the game in places like the Temple of Bhaal or the Northern Island, bosses becoming much weaker in time due to their protection spells running out. Alternatively, you can simply walk into a room until a spell dissolves.
</li><li> Sometimes monsters follow you between rooms. Although this might appear to increase the difficulty because you are constantly chased, it actually makes the game easier because you can divide enemy forces and kill them one by one.
</li><li> If Drizzt can be surrounded by NPC party members (it will take a full party of CHARNAME plus the 5 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">Non Player Characters</a> and can be a bit tricky to accomplish as he wanders hasted) and then Reform until all former members become neutral, his attack will be limited to close-range melee. In that situation, Drizzt can be killed with either a ranged or long-range melee weapon with total safety for the CHARNAME. Only natural 20 rolls will hit him and none of those will register as critical hits since Drizzt is immune to those. A sizable reputation loss will result from his death.
<ul><li> It is also possible to play tag with Drizzt around the lake, using the Boots of Speed to evade his strikes. Drizzt's pathfinding in Baldur's Gate is not that great and he can get stuck in the middle of the lake, with the player on the other side. For wizards, using Dimension Door to cross the lake is advised. The player can then pepper him with arrows or ranged spells with impunity until he dies.
</li></ul></li><li> Algernon is a portly old man on the second floor of Feldepost's Inn in Beregost. He wears what appears to be a Nymph's Cloak but it has nearly unlimited charges of Charm, which requires a very high Save vs. Breath Weapon to resist. The quest involving Algernon's Cloak does not trigger until the player arrives in Baldur's Gate, but the cloak itself is available as early as Chapter 1. Most parties would not know Algernon has the cloak, as typically only an evil-aligned party would murder Algernon and discover it, and thieves would not know some random man in an inn would possess such a powerful item. The cloak can be used to charm almost any character in the game, allowing them to reveal information while under the charmed effect (Baldur's Gate II removes these dialogue strings, preventing players from conversing with charmed/dominated characters) and also allowing one to command them in battle. This even applies to characters far beyond the player's level and abilities, allowing some battles to be won fairly easily so long as the target fails the saving throw.
</li><li> Take a potion that is restricted to mages like Heroism. Put the potion in one of your inventory slots, and put a usable potion - like a healing potion to the next inventory slot. Pause the game. Right click on the healing potion, choose "drink". When on the inventory still paused, switch the places of the two items, and the restricted item WILL be used/consumed. This is possible with other restricted items as well.

<ul><li> When a new game is started in Shadows of Amn, a cutscene begins with Irenicus where the player character has no items. Items imported from Baldur's Gate are removed by a script at the start of this cutscene. However, there is a brief period where the player has control right before cutscene mode goes into effect. The screen is dark and because the character starts out in a cage, he/she cannot move. A quick player can pause the game during this period of freedom, and dump all items on his/her person. This avoids having the items wiped by the script and allows them to be requipped after freedom is restored. The Double Rings of Wizardry won't work if this method is applied. This makes early game (not only the initial dungeon) a lot easier, especially if you deliberately set up a character with specific powerful items to import. However, this exploit was fixed in Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition. Might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>.
</li><li> The game has many quests where you have to face beholders, which are powerful and capable of killing your party in two seconds. However, you can buy in a shop a magical shield that reflects their attacks, making you nigh invulnerable against them. This can actually broke many sections regarded as among the hardest in the game, to the point that some players consider it cheesey. The beholder lair in the Underdark can be traversed like a hot knife cutting butter. The most blatant example is an early quest against a powerful blind beholder called the Unseeing Eye. Since your party is not leveled up enough until much later, a direct confrontation is suicidal. To defeat him, you are supposed plot-wise to enter new dungeons facing many new monsters and finaly assembly a magical rod that will heavily weaken the beholder. But with the reflecting shield you can ignore everything and simply destroy him without difficulty.
</li><li> Multiple enemies and bosses, including at least two dragons, start out non-hostile and go hostile later in the game, giving you a perfect opportunity to have your thief carpet the ground with traps. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This also works on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Kangaxx</a>, with one particularly funny anti-Kangaxx strategy being to booby-trap both the spawn area and the wall a bit of a way behind him, triggering his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a> second stage in two seconds because his first form gets pelted to death by traps, and then using the Ring of the Ram to push his demilich form into the second area.</span>

It also allows you to grab a decent sword for Faith builds and a shield with 100% physical block and good fire resistance very early (though said loot is guarded by an Undead Dragon).
</li><li> The Ceaseless Discharge boss looks very intimidating, being a giant demonic lava monster. But it can be defeated very early in the game simply by grabbing the robes it's guarding, baiting it into trying to punch you, then running back to the fog gate. Done right, this will lead to the boss trying and failing to jump over a large gap leaving it clinging helplessly to the edge. At which point you can strike its hand at your leisure, finishing it off.
</li><li> The infamous Anor Londo Archers are intended to be defeated by running up as quickly as possible and dodging the arrows your way so that you can take them out one at a time. Or you can just make sure you have a bow and a bunch of poison arrows. Simply position yourself so that their arrows are deflected by the railings and fire two or three poison arrows at them. Then sit back and wait for them to expire.
</li><li> The Capra Demon can be easily dispatched by lobbing several Dung Pies, a consumable that inflicts the deadly toxic status effect, over the boss fog at him.
</li><li> Chaos Witch Quelaag can be a tricky boss especially if you don't have good fire resistant gear. She is however much easier if you break out of the habit of locking onto enemies. Her real weakpoint is her human upper torso (which can't be locked onto) — aiming arrows or sorceries at her torso will stun-lock her, making her much more manageable.
</li><li> In a similar vein, Artorias can be made less dangerous by manually aiming at his head and firing an arrow at him while he's preparing to buff himself. This knocks him out of it and briefly stuns him, giving you an opportunity to attack (and ensuring he doesn't get his power boost). You can also try staggering him by dealing sufficient melee damage, though this is riskier.
</li><li> Seath the Scaleless can only be harmed after you destroy his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">Primordial Crystal</a>. However, if you bait him into destroying it <em>himself</em> with one of his own attacks, he spends a few seconds getting mad at himself for falling for your trick. This can be especially helpful if you're trying to cut off the tip of his middle tail for the Moonlight Greatsword.
</li><li> Sen's Fortress is extremely dangerous due to a plethora of death traps and powerful enemies. It can however be made considerably easier by finding a somewhat hidden bonfire <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that requires you to roll off a roof through a hole in a fence outside</span>. This bonfire ensures that you don't have to go back through the death traps in the fortress again if you die to the enemies outside of the fortress.
</li><li> The Iron Golem is generally considered a joke by the community because he has <em>two</em> such strategies. In the first, if you stagger him, he'll fall on his ass, but if you position him correctly, he'll fall off the cliff. In the second, you can summon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">Black Iron Tarkus</a>, who can easily 1v1 the golem presuming the it doesn't throw him off the same cliff.
</li><li> Manus is normally a very challenging boss with high health, punishing physical attack combos, and devastating Abyssal sorceries. However, the entire fight with him can be bypassed if you look carefully at the hole right before the fog gate. Just like with the Bloatheads earlier in the cave, you can see Manu's eyes glowing. If you aim your bow just right, you can simply make Manus into a pincushion. Actually <em>killing</em> him this way will take a good bow and hundreds of arrows, but it's certainly much easier than actually fighting him directly.

<ul><li> Enemies have a maximum number of spawns instead of coming back infinitely, meaning that levels in general get easier and easier as you kill more and more enemies.
</li><li> Heide's Tower of Flame has several ways to make the level easier. First, the Dragonrider can be baited into falling off his platform if you didn't activate the levers, or shot full of arrows so you can kill him with one blow if you did. Second, most of the enemies will follow you forever, meaning that you can kite them back to the first arena, which is both comparatively large for the Flame Tower and very close to the bonfire for easy recovery if you do mess up; plus, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookChivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookChivalry">often groups of enemies will follow you at different speeds</a>, letting you deal with them in smaller groups.
</li><li> The giant Basilisk in the Shaded Woods has a very low aggro range, at least in an unpatched game, so you can just shoot it to death and it won't react.
</li><li> There's a hidden bonfire down a side path about fifty feet from the Rotten's boss fog in Black Gulch, significantly shortening the gauntlet of bullshit poison-spitting statues you need to deal with.
</li><li> Mythal, the Baneful Queen, is very susceptible to two specific elements of her own level. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">First, if you set the windmill on fire in Earthen Peak, the poisonous pool in her boss arena and the one immediately outside it are both drained, meaning she can't heal over time and you don't need to wade through venom to fight her. Second, Jester Thomas, the NPC summon directly outside her arena, wields pyromancy, which she is extremely vulnerable to.</span>
</li><li> Subverted with the Lost Sinner boss fight. The actual <em>trick</em> - lighting up her boss arena so you can stay locked on - is pretty straightforward, but actually getting the key you need to do it is like pulling teeth and requires you to defeat another fairly difficult boss. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">First, you need to go to the room below the Servants' Quarters in the Lost Bastille and use a Pharros Lockstone on the contraption. This will gain you access to Belfry Luna, which is covered in Bellkeeper Soldiers and is a heavily invaded area thanks to the Bellkeepers' covenant. Once you've reached the top of the Belfry, fought the Red Phantom there, and rung the bell, the Belfry Gargoyles boss fight becomes available, at which point you probably die a bunch of times. Once you beat the Gargoyles, there's a ladder to the side of the bonfire that leads down to a fight with a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats">undead dogs</a> and a quick Red Phantom with a lot of reach; the Bastille Key is on a corpse behind him.</span> <em>Scholar of the First Sin</em> made it easier by having the key available only after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss">Ruin Sentinels</a>, making it less of a hassle to obtain it.
</li><li> There are several large containers in the Iron Keep that are full of water, which raise your fire resistance if you roll through them - very useful given that the Iron Keep is half submerged in lava and the first boss there is called the Smelter Demon.

</li><li> The first Boreal Outrider Knight, a difficult <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss">Mini-Boss</a>, can be relatively easily baited into falling down a lift shaft to its death.
</li><li> The Road of Sacrifices has a summon for the mad phantom of Holy Knight Hodrick, who lacks the laser-focus on the player that invaders usually do; while he'll happily follow you, he'll pick fights with everything he finds on the way - allowing you to slam him into tough enemies like the Exile Watchdogs or Yellowfinger Heysel.
</li><li> The Cathedral of the Deep has a few fights that get a lot easier if you can take out the Thralls, and a tough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss">Mini-Boss</a> who can't get through the door.

Because the Fire Demon attacks so much more slowly, it usually loses.

<ul><li> In the intended way of playing the game, you hide in the shadows, avoiding every contact, and slowly explore. However, since enemies are stupid (particularly zombies) you could often dodge and skip them all by simply... jumping. You will be even faster and the guards will always miss you. Many speedruns exploit a lot this trick. It works best when you already know a level, so you can simply constantly jump towards your objective and complete the mission while all the enemies are packed together pursuing you. With a little boldness you can also do this while exploring a new level. If you are overrun by too many enemies or you need to think about what you must do next, you can simply jump to a safe hidden place and wait for the area to be clear. Note however that some levels require you to stealth anyway to fulfill an objective, i.e. the beginning of "Assassins" or the ending of "Into the Maw of Chaos".
</li><li> Level 9, titled "Return to the Cathedral", requires you to steal a powerful artifact inside a haunted cathedral full of undead creatures and then exit. After you grab it, you will discover that the entrance has been closed and magically sealed. You will have to find another way to escape. Here starts the true level, its longest and hardest part. However, you can cheese the level by putting a skull or a rock that blocks the entrance door. When you return with the artifact, the door will be technically locked (you can click and hear the sound of a locked door), but the skull will have blocked the door from moving, leaving the entrance open. Other tricks exploit a glitch that lets you die passing through walls, thus counting as "exiting" the cathedral, or leaning through the door while shooting fire arrows. Experienced players can complete the level in a minute (there are even 30 or less seconds speedrun video on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>!). The downside is that you won't grab loot, so the next level will start without cash for items and arrows. Note that Thief Gold solved the trick by doubling the mass of the door so that nothing will stop its automatical closure.

You'd expect this to come at some sort of cost or not be of much help, but no: on easier difficulties he literally does all the work for you, and all you have to do is take out Vamp at the end. Harder difficulties force you to do at least some of the work, but it's still worlds easier than attempting to go it by yourself.

<ul><li> The fight with the Shagohod tank can be resolved fairly quickly by shooting out the treads so it can't move at all. The game, of course, doesn't tell you this.
</li><li> A <em>lot</em> of areas, as well as the battle with The Pain, can be made much easier by answering "I like MGS3" at the beginning of the game which gives you the brown face paint that gives you unlimited oxygen (not that the game bothers to tell you this). Most enemies can't see you underwater, no enemies can follow you into the water (save for crocodiles, but they're rare), and The Pain is completely unable to harm you when you're submerged, giving you a handy safe space in a lot of areas.
</li><li> The Fear can be taken out in seconds if you think ahead and bring some Poison Dart Frogs to the battle. Let him drain his stamina attacking, throw them to the middle of the room, let him eat them, finish him off with your tranquilizer gun. This takes about a minute tops.
</li><li> Shooting the End in the back when you first encounter him saves you an <em>ungodly</em> amount of time later on if you're not especially good with the sniper rifle. The Ocelot unit that takes his place can be gunned down or sneaked past with relative ease.

Act 3 can be made a lot easier by wearing civilian clothing, non-wanted face camo (such as Campbell, Drebin, any of the B&amp;Bs), carrying no weapon, and complying with the first PMC that sees you: they'll halt you, pat you down, let you go, and now none of the PMCs will regard you as a threat unless they happen to spot you using a weapon later.

</li><li> Mission 11 ("Cloaked in Silence") can be easily ended nonlethally by calling in a supply drop right on top of Quiet. It takes out half her stamina bar and can be done as soon as you've tagged her position.
</li><li> Mission 12 ("Hellbound"): The entire journey from the Serak Power Plant to Central Base Camp can be skipped if you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">know</a> that you can jump in a cardboard box at the Delivery Point and transport yourself there.

The level can be beaten in two minutes or less with this trick.
</li><li> Mission 30 ("Skull Face") can be cheesed by riding D-Walker and carrying a Ballistic Shield on your back. All you have to do is speed through the base and stop for nothing until you reach the stairs at the very back. Doing this will net you an easy S-rank in record time.
</li><li> Mission 32 ("To Know Too Much"): It is trivially easy to ride to the intel agent and extract him before the search team reaches him if you know where he is beforehand, and the area can be easily left without anyone being wiser.

Throwing sneezing powder at a soldier will result in said target being killed by an errant gunshot. A spoiler-free first play of the mission can take well over an hour. With the trick? About two and a half minutes.

<ul><li> Running is almost always suicidal since you will attract the alien with your noise. However, if you press the crouch and run buttons, with a little practice you can run without making any noise at all. This technique is a must-do for many speedruns, although it breaks the atmosphere.
</li><li> Mission 16 requires you to stealth your way through many armed security guards, eager to kill you. However, there is a hidden switch that allows you to free an android that will engage the guards for you if you lure it in the main hallway... just beware that it will be hostile towards you too.
</li><li> Mission 10, "The Trap", you are supposed to lock sections of the space station and lead the alien to an ejectable pod. The mission is divided in three sublevels. In the first sublevel you are tasked to trigger shutters designed against piracy, in an attempt to imprison the alien in an isolated section of the space station. The xenomorph will obviously make the process difficult. However, you can actually lock the alien between a shutter and a closed door at the very beginning of the level, thus preventing it from disturbing you for the rest of the level! This specific shutter is the one above the stairs. Simply toss a flare in front of the door, make some noise to attract the alien and hide. When it comes, it will investigate the flare. If spacing is right, he will be exactly in the tiny space between the shutter and the door. You then can sneak to the sealing device and trap the xenomorph! <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6as66UUEFc">As this video shows<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, hilarity could potentially ensue. You will still have to complete the objectives and lock the remaining shutters as intended by game-story and developers, just without any enemy around. Note however that after you seal all the required shutters, and trigger the sequence in the server room where you become trapped inside and must wait for Ricardo to undo everything to get free (the alien is supposed to escape too), the xenomorph will script-spawn. It will follow you in the second sublevel in Gemini Solutions as well, which you will access soon afterwards.
</li><li> In survivor mode, the map "Loose Ends" requires you to escape from an elevator. However the elevator is off power and its door closed. The player is supposed to go to a nearby comm stat to reinitialize energy, which triggers the alien to come looking for him, and then backtrack to the elevator and escape. However, due to a bug, the player can "lean" inside the elevator and manage to press the button to win the challenge even with door closed, thus completely avoiding to go to the comm sat room and escape from the xenomorph.
</li><li> Mission 5 has the player being locked down inside a medical bay, looking for a passcode to enter a new area. When the passcode is found and the player leaves the room, a script triggers the entrance of the xenomorph from a vent in front of the player. You are supposed to hide under a bed precisely on your right and then play the game as always by hiding, moving and distracting the alien until you get out. This level is considered by many players as one of the most difficult parts of the game. The trick is: the alien entrance is so slow that you can simply ignore it and go to the locked door, enter the password and leave that section when the alien starts to patrol. You still have to find a keycard in the new area before reaching an elevator, however. But sometimes it is possible to even do this without ever meeting (again) the alien in the meanwhile, especially if you toss a flare before the scripted alien entrance, thus gaining 30 more seconds while you enter the code, recover the keycard and go to the elevator from an unnoticed door nearby without backtracking.

From night 3 onward, when Freddy starts to become active, you can prevent him from getting anywhere close to your office simply by constantly raising and lowering the Show Stage camera all night. Doing so will not only hold Freddy in place for most of the night, but it also helps prevent Foxy from making a run at you. You'll still need to keep an eye on your doors for Bonnie and Chica, but seeing how Freddy is more dangerous than either of them, it makes the latter half of the game significantly easier. While this won't work as well in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel">4</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">20</a> Mode, you <em>can</em> prevent Freddy from attacking you by focusing on Cam 1B (which is where he jumpscares you from), locking him in place and preventing him from getting to you.
<ul><li> Nights 1 and 2 can be completely negated simply by closing the left door and doing absolutely nothing else. The only two enemies who can attack you from the right door are Freddy and Chica. The former doesn't move on those nights, and the latter can only kill you if you raise your camera.

You start an entire week behind as you need to find a town to develop in the first place, meanwhile your opponent starts with three fully upgraded towns right from the get-go, as well as several heroes with fantastic stats. Oh, and they have their own private island with all the resources they would ever need. However, if you took the time to beat mission 7 first, you gain the ability to get any stack of dragons on the map to join you, which turns this mission into an absolute curbstomp. Instead of capturing the nearby town and building it up, all you need to do is head to the north section of the map as fast as possible, grabbing any stacks of dragons on the way, then proceed to whoop the ass of any enemy heroes/towns you come across. If you do it quickly enough, you can make it to one of the enemy's towns before the one week time limit runs out.

</li><li> A lot of the escort missions force you to make sure your vehicle doesn't blow up while roaming gang cars are shooting from you at all angles. You could either have mad skills in driving... or just drive off road and avoid rival cars altogether.
</li><li> In one of the first missions in <em>San Andreas</em>, you have to follow a train in a motorbike with Big Smoke in the back seat shooting bad guys standing on top of the train. The short cut is to get the bike, run ahead of the train, climb a concrete rail and a bridge, stop at the roof of a building and jump on top of the train as it passes. Now shoot at will. But there's a time limit for this technique, as there's a certain bridge passing over the train that knocks you from the top of the train. Alternatively, tap the accelerate button instead of holding it to make the bike go faster, which is also an Easy Level Trick on any bike races.

Unless you did them in Angel Pine (the village you're dropped into after <em>The Green Sabre</em> mission), in which case all targets spawn within the village, seconds from one another.
</li><li> Hunter helicopter makes Vigilante missions a breeze, since the criminals can't shoot back at you and its turret auto-locks onto targets, has unlimited ammo and can shred a car in seconds. Made doubly easy in <em>San Andreas</em> if you start the missions over the Bone County desert (where Hunter spawns after you get all golds in Flight School) since the flat, empty terrain eliminates the need for precise manuvering between buildings, which was the main challenge of the mission in <em>Vice City</em>.

</li><li> <em>Vice City</em> features a mission where the player is tasked with stealing a tank from an army convoy traveling through the city, which would require damaging the door on the tank enough to hijack it, all while surrounded by soldiers and the tank in question.

Note that not only is this the easiest way to beat these maps, it's also the <em>intended</em> way.
</li><li> The 70-man battle near the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shenmue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shenmue">Shenmue</a></em> is one of the toughest and definitely the biggest challenge the game throws at you. However, if you don't follow Gui Zhang's trail of asskicking and simply hang back in the starting area, it becomes a breeze; enemies trickle in slowly enough that you can take them out one or two at a time, without having to worry about getting overwhelmed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising2">Dead Rising 2</a></em> has Case 5-2: The Getaway. It features a battle with a helicopter where you need to winch it down with a crane and then throw something at the rotors to damage it. Of course, due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug">programming oversight</a> the projectiles shot from the normally harmless Toy Spitball Gun were coded as thrown objects rather than projectiles or bullets, and it has enough range to hit the rotors without winching the helicopter down. That's right, you can shoot down a helicopter in seconds by <em>shooting a Nerf Gun at it</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Prototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Prototype">[PROTOTYPE]</a></em>, certain sidequests task you with destroying military targets, granting points based on what you destroy. You're supposed to target military vehicles that spawn to kill you, but the game counts vehicles even if no one is in them. This means you can hijack vehicles, park them nearby, then blow them all up for an easy score boost.
