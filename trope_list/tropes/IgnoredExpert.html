During the Thousand Year Blood War arc, Yamamoto even tries to invoke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraDidIt">Cassandra Did It</a> on Mayuri for allowing the current situation to happen.

<div class="indent"><strong>Yamamoto</strong>: "If your Research and Development Department had reported and managed it more promptly, this situation may have been avoidable." <br/><strong>Mayuri</strong>: "That is not true.

Even though she told the corporate executives of her company that the reactor she was developing was a new design and had a chance of a meltdown, they slashed the testing time of the reactor from one month down to ten days. They also had the safety protocols of the reactor done by their own people, who were more interested in getting the testing done quickly rather than properly. The Chief Engineer's fears were realized on the day of the reactor's live test run, and a meltdown occurred that killed several civilians in the process, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">including her daughter, Alicia</span>.

Shinichi Kudo was once a famous detective, but after he was shrunk down to the body of a 6-year-old, the police rarely, if ever, listen to him whenever he finds an important clue.

It's heavily implied that due to Louis' own personal wealth and power, the Emperor can't refuse his advice.

Sadly, Marie Antoinette is quickly swayed away from it by Versailles' opulence, and by the time she comes back to her senses she has already set in motion the events that would lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a>...

He and his wife Alura built the shield dome which saved Argo City when Krypton exploded. Afterwards he pleaded with Argo City's Science Council to find a new world to settle in, reasoning that the shields protecting the city wouldn't last forever. They didn't listen, even though he is the man who designed the shields to start with, and his brother was the man who correctly predicted Krypton's destruction.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LastSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LastSon">Last Son</a></em>, General Zod's backstory was rewritten to include involvement in Jor-El's story. Zod supported Jor-El's claims, but no-one would listen to him either. His motivation for trying to take over Krypton was to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">supplant the Science Council and</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">force</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">everyone to listen</a>.
</li><li> It also happened to other members of the House of El. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKryptonChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKryptonChronicles">The Krypton Chronicles</a></em> Sul-El, an astronomer who developed the first Kryptonian telescope, tried to warn the governor of Kandor that he had spotted an -possibly hostile- alien fleet approaching Krypton. He was mocked and despised by everyone until the Vrangs landed and began shooting people off indiscriminately.
</li><li> This is also the backstory of Superman villain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Brainiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Brainiac">Brainiac</a> during the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a></em>; he was the greatest scientist of Yod-Colu, but his discovery of an impending threat to the planet was laughed at. He was even labeled insane and sent into exile. It wasn't long before he returned, used his technologies to compile a record of the planet's culture and history, and killed most of the population.

The bacteria mine the brain tissue to harness neural electricity for energy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop">which is slowly killing him</a>. One scientist is aware that "the world" is alive and they are killing it, but no-one will listen. Eventually doctors are forced to cut out the city with a laser, killing them all, but before it does the scientist and his wife load their son into a vessel and lauch it towards the liver, where "the iron-rich blood will give him powers and abilities undreamt of by our race". The last panel of the comic is the rocket lying on the surface of the liver, with two bacteria moving towards it.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Normalman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Normalman">normalman</a></em>, where Norm's father was a no-name accountant who irrationally came to the conclusion that his planet was doomed, bought a rocket at a convenience store, and sent his son into space. Norm's mother killed him immediately after he did so.

After he sends N-Ree away in an escape rocket, R-Thur assures his wife that they will never see their son again, and begin to prepare for their eventual demise. It's gonna happen...

They rejected his claims on the grounds that he didn't have enough evidence. So he created a means by which Cybertronians would be able to survive the on-coming cataclysm, and tested it on himself. The result? An unstoppable insane behemoth that required the combined firepower of both armies to just slow down, and the utter annihilation of a large chunk of Cybertron. Whoops.

It's simply that there's no way to avert the catastrophe short of shutting off the mana taps, which will destroy their civilization just as thoroughly. They even state that if there is anything the Council can do for him, he has only to ask.

Eventually, he builds a life for himself, starts a family, and learns to play the flute.

His efforts to warn the people of his community and the government of the planet at first seem to go ignored, and it looks like this trope is going to be in effect. But they reveal they already knew about the problem but were powerless to do anything about it. The truth is they were just trying to prevent a panic while working on a secret project to preserve something of their civilization: a special probe that would be launched into space using their most advanced rocketry, in hopes of finding someone in the future to carry on the memory of their people

</li><li> In "Force of Nature", an alien scientist tries to convince Starfleet that warp travel in the area of space near her system will cause a spatial rift which would be very bad for her people.

Worf then says that if people would just let him shoot things when he initially wanted to shoot them, life would be a lot simpler.
</li><li> There doesn't even need to be a crisis either. In one episode Worf simply asks if they could send a regular engineer over to inspect a disabled alien space ship instead of wasting the time of their Chief Engineer for something so minor. When that question's shot down he insists they send over some security personnel for safety since it's still a random space ship they just met.

Patterson tries to tell Springfielders that Homer has no clue what being an elected official is all about, with all kinds of extravagant promises. Homer wins in a landslide, but true to Ray's predictions, Homer proves himself unqualified for the position, spending his year's budget in one month because he hadn't realized how expensive his campaign promises would actually be, recouping the money by having other cities take their trash to Springfield. This leaves Springfield so badly trashed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that they have to move the town five miles away</span>.

</li><li> Unfortunately, this tends to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> for scientists whose discoveries go against the established ideas of the time. One example is Dr. Alice Stewart, who showed a correlation between pre-natal X-ray screening and cancer, and was ignored for several years.
</li><li> Similarly, Dr. Martin Couney created the incubator to help premature infants survive. However, since conventional wisdom was that those infants wouldn't make it, it was a waste of resources to establish them in hospitals, leading Couney <a class="urllink" href="https://www.npr.org/2015/07/10/421239869/babies-on-display-when-a-hospital-couldnt-save-them-a-sideshow-did">to install them at sideshows and charge $0.40 admission to help fund it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Sir John Fastolf was the only English commander in France toward the end of the Hundred Years War who not only realized and was willing to declare publicly that England was, at long last, losing the war, but also had a constructive proposal for salvaging the situation. For his pains, he was disgraced after the defeat and turned into the clownish figure of Falstaff by Shakespeare. Shakespeare was originally going to call the character Oldcastle, but changed it to Falstaff <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">at the insistence of his patron</a> the Lord Chamberlain, descendant of the former. Ironically, the character himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">is among Shakespeare's most beloved</a>.
</li><li> A historical War &amp; Politics example can be found in <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Brock">Sir Isaac Brock<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the British General in charge of the defense of Upper Canada (present-day Ontario) against the United States in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOf1812" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOf1812">War of 1812</a>. He was one of a few who believed that war with the U.S. was imminent and one of fewer who actually cared about the implications this would have for British North America. He and a small number of other leaders (like the Native Chief Tecumseh) took steps to prepare against a possible invasion (even his time collaborating with Tecumseh was only a short couple of days, and Brock's main focus was on making sure the militia would be ready). Although he died at Queenston Heights, his preparations (taken completely of his own accord) and his strategic skill in several battles ultimately secured the safety of Upper Canada. As his Wikipedia Article states:
<div class="indent"><em>"While many in Canada and Britain believed war could be averted, Brock began to ready the army and militia for what was to come. When the War of 1812 broke out, the populace was prepared, and quick victories at Fort Mackinac and Detroit crippled American invasion efforts. Brock's actions, particularly his success at Detroit, earned him a knighthood, membership in the Order of the Bath, accolades and the epithet "The Hero of Upper Canada"."</em>
</div></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCivilWar">American Civil War</a>, Confederate General James Longstreet advised General Robert E. Lee during the Pennsylvania invasion to flank around Gettysburg to get between the Union Army and Washington to be able to fight their enemy from a position of strength. Instead, Lee ignored his subordinate's advice and fought in a direct confrontation in Gettysburg where Union General Meade was able to hold the high ground. This also culminated in the infamous Pickett's charge, a front assault Longstreet warned would be likely futile and practically suicidal, only for Lee to ignore him again. As a result, the offensive power of the Confederacy was broken in a fiasco that Lee took full responsibility for. However, Longstreet would later be made the scapegoat by the Lost Cause proponents for over a century until the famous history book, <em>Killer Angels</em> (adapted into the film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gettysburg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gettysburg">Gettysburg</a></em>), rehabilitated his reputation as a sensible commander Lee should have heeded in the first place.
</li><li> In 1865, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goyder%27s_Line">George Goyder drew a line<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> splitting South Australia into two areas: land suited for agriculture in the south, and land unsuited for it in the north. He based it on sound observations of the vegetation, but farmers settled in the north anyway due to high rainfall in the previous few years. Then they had to vacate when the rains stopped and the land became just as dry and useless as he said it would.
</li><li> Ignaz Semmelweis discovered that childbed fever can be avoided by use of hand washing standards in clinics. His findings were rejected, and were only accepted after his death. The idea of disinfection only really took off after Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur produced definite proof of the relationship between germs and disease. Washing your hands to prevent infection was popular in England even before Semmelweis, but since the English scientists still believed in the theory of miasma, they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightForTheWrongReasons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightForTheWrongReasons">Right for the Wrong Reasons</a>. To be fair, Semmelweiss didn't advocate washing your hands <em>with soap</em>, he advocated washing them with carbolic acid (phenol, now known to be a carcinogen), which doesn't exactly promote the kind of skin you'd see in a hand lotion commercial. You can see why folks might resist the idea. (Well, that, and Semmelweiss was by many accounts about as sane as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikolaTesla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikolaTesla">Nikola Tesla</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3gupn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3gupn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3gupn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There is some conjecture on whether he had early-onset dementia, caught syphilis from performing gynecological exams, or was driven to madness and despair by the vicious attacks on his character</span>)
<ul><li> In the hospital where Semmelweis developed his theory, the medical students examined women in childbed after <em>having cut open and examined the corpses of women who died in childbed fever.</em> Without washing their hands between. Advice to wash your hands with water after touching a corpse is in the <em>Bible</em> ... that's a lot of generations of stubbornly ignoring good advice.
</li><li> Worse still, doctors still only wash their hands about half as much as they need to...if they're one of the more hygienic hospitals.

They tested it on animals, but none reacted to the chemical. They gave it to one of their colleagues whose pregnant wife took it which actually helped her to sleep. Her child ended up being born without ears though and the man advised against selling the chemical. It was on market a few months later as Contergan, specifically marketed as a sleeping and relaxation drug for <em>pregnant women</em> and caused one of the biggest drug scandals of the 1960s and 1970s <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4lliu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4lliu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4lliu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="urllink" href="https://i0.wp.com/www.pravda-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/contergankinder.jpg?w=450&amp;ssl=1">5000 to 7000 children<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.welt.de/img/vermischtes/mobile101016548/9062508057-ci102l-w1024/Contergan1-DW-Politik-Hamburg-jpg.jpg">were born with severe malformation of limbs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/incoming/94203-1.jpg-article289291.html/ALTERNATES/v4_3_w620/94203-1.jpg?ts=1452891614000">with only 40% of them surviving<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></span>.

</li></ul></li><li> For all of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleBigot">his faults</a>, President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WoodrowWilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WoodrowWilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> pretty early. For, I tell you, my fellow citizens, I can predict with absolute certainty that within another generation there will be another world war if the nations of the world do not concert the method by which to prevent it. (Sept. 8, 1919). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">The world at large had a much more favorable view of Wilson in the years after World War II</a>, the consensus being that if people had actually listened to him then the second one would have been avoided. Since then, his reputation has fluctuated a lot.
<ul><li> Along the same lines, at the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, Marshal Ferdinand Foch warned "this is not a peace, it is an armistice for twenty years." Yet France was unprepared when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">World War II started 20 years and 65 days later</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Mitchell_(general)">General Billy Mitchell<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> who, in 1924, prophesied a war between the Japanese Empire and the USA over the two's interests in China and the Pacific. He also predicted that it would be the Empire who would strike first, much as they had done in the Russo-Japanese war of '04-'05. For that matter, his advocacy of air power, and actually <em>demonstrating</em> that ships at sea were vulnerable to enemy aircraft,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5yxtq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5yxtq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5yxtq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">His "demonstrations" consisted of dropping bombs on stationary, unmanned ships. A ship maneuvering at high speed, carrying damage-control parties, and filling the air around it with bullets would be a much tougher nut to crack.</span> led to him being court-martialed after pissing off the Navy brass, who were addicted to bigger and better battleships, and refused to acknowledge the rising power of the aircraft carrier. Come December 7, 1941...
<ul><li> Likewise, US Admiral Harry Yarnell proved in a war game in 1932 that Pearl Harbor was vulnerable to an aerial (sneak) attack. However, his superiors dismissed his findings, and Admiral Ernest King's that confirmed them in a later war game, and were proven wrong the hard way in 1941 when the Imperial Navy's air forces used the <em>same approaches</em> that Yarnell had used to attack the fleet at anchor there, to devastating but somewhat ephemeral effect.
<ul><li> To make things worse, little more than a year earlier <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Taranto">the Royal Navy had successfully executed an attack against the Italian fleet in a harbor just as shallow as Pearl Harbor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. And to add insult to injury, Japanese officers actually <em>went to Italy and took notes from the defenders of Taranto</em> to make sure the attack (that they had already been working over in 1939) would consider as much as possible.
</li></ul></li><li> On the other side, when the USA placed crippling sanctions upon the Empire of Japan to protest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo">their occupation of French Indochina</a> (and implicitly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecondSinoJapaneseWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecondSinoJapaneseWar">their continued war upon China</a>), the Japanese cabinet refused to consider negotiating seriously on withdrawing Japan's forces. Instead, the Navy pushed to implement its Southern Attack Plan — which entailed, by necessity, declaring war on the Netherlands, Britain and America. The man they chose to orchestrate their attack upon the USA's fleet, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, explicitly told his superiors that the plan was fatally flawed. He understood that a war with the USA would not be like the war with Russia — the former was far more powerful relative to Japan than the latter had been. He predicted that the USA's 'massive' financial-industrial advantage (of about ten-to-one, which is even greater than it sounds because of the greater efficiency involved in economies of scale) would start to show within just six months of the start of a war with them. His exact words, in fact were: "I will be able to run wild for six months to a year at the outside. After that, I can give no guarantees." Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The Battle of Midway, where Japan lost the cream of her carrier fleet, and which can be seen as the high-water mark of Japanese expansion during the war, ended on June 7, 1942 — <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">exactly six months to the day of Pearl Harbor.</a></em>
<ul><li> He warned Japan against withdrawing from the Washington Naval Treaty, knowing of the sheer US advantage in industrial and financial strength, and argued that the treaty was actually excellent because (1) it stopped the US from outbuilding Japan by insane margins, and (2) Japan wasn't capable of building much more than what the treaty allowed them to build. However, he did this in an era where the Japanese, the IJN in particular, was fulminating against the treaty and thus got labeled as dishonorable. To make things worse, he did not have enough influence in the IJN or the government to do anything about it. He was proven right; US naval construction dropped in 1943-44 because they realised that they won already and didn't need any more.
</li><li> He also advised against making super battleships like the <em>Yamato</em>, which Army and Navy airpower advocates rightly considered a waste of very scarce resources. The Japanese Army was willing to listen, but the Navy predominated in the ship tendering process and forced the government to place orders for yet more battleships despite their incredible expense and very marginal utility. The most egregious example was the <em>Yamato</em> class, which was worse than useless in combat but consumed crew and materials sufficient to double the carrier fleet.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Great New England Hurricane of 1938 was predicted to swerve out to sea by the National Weather Service, but instead kept moving due North and slammed into Long Island and the coast beyond. The lone Weather Service employee who had pointed out the threat of such a landfall was disregarded due to his lack of seniority, and no warnings were issued until after the storm had demolished regional communication lines. The predictions that it would veer out to sea were very reasonable and actually probably more likely to come true. The main problem was that nobody kept watch on it just in case it didn't change course as predicted.
</li><li> Similar to the above, the death toll from the Hurricane that hit Galveston, Texas in 1900 would've probably been much less if the National Weather Service hadn't ignored information coming out of Cuba due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">pride</a>.
</li><li> Dutch engineer Johan van Veen. From 1937 on he started petitioning and warning the Dutch government to reinforce the diking system in the south-western part of the Netherlands. Nobody listened to him. Cue 1953, a freak storm and much of the province Zeeland was flooded, with 1800 people dead. After the stormflood... he got all of his plans approved and this started a 30 year project of protecting the south-western lands from the North Sea. Knowing the government would not listen to his warning, how did he sign his proposals before the fated storm? Dr. Cassandra.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajont_Dam">Vajont Dam<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in Italy. When it was being constructed in the late 1950s, three experts published studies warning that the nearby Mount Toc was in danger of collapsing into the artificial lake if the barrage's filling went ahead. They were ignored and four years later, Mount Toc followed up on their predictions, earning Vajont the dubious honor of being the source of the largest man-made tsunami in history (a <em>250-meter-high</em>, or <em>820-foot-high</em> wall of water that wiped out several villages and killed thousands in its path).
</li><li> Engineer Roger Boisjoly found evidence that an essential component of the Space Shuttle's rocket booster was rendered unreliable by cold temperatures<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6n5u2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6n5u2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6n5u2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">These being the O-rings, which create seals on the fuel tank; cold rendered the O-rings rigid and unpliable, meaning gaps in the seal were created</span>; nobody listened to him, partly because the company that made the booster was in the middle of negotiating a new contract with NASA. A year after Bosjoly's discovery, the Challenger space shuttle exploded because of this particular design flaw. <br/><br/>It was actually a lot worse: the launch of Challenger went ahead that morning, despite the official receiving screaming memos ("Red Alert!" in red ink) not to launch. "Take off your engineering hat, and put on your management hat." Commissioner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardFeynman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardFeynman">Richard Feynman</a> discovered massive disconnect between management and engineers in the Space Shuttle program. Management routinely disregarded what engineers said.
</li><li> Harry Markopolos spent years trying to convince the SEC that a well-connected genius investor was running a massive Ponzi scheme. They all ignored him until Bernie Madoff's fund collapsed. Some have pointed out his abrasiveness made his message harder to swallow (he once called the SEC staff "a bunch of idiots"). Others have pointed out it was well deserved.
</li><li> There were a number of people who saw the 2008 financial crisis and ensuing Great Recession coming, but were ignored.
<ul><li> Former Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooksley_Born">Brooksley Born<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> identified a problem in the over-the-counter derivatives market that did not cause the financial crisis, but made the damage much worse. Naturally, she was ignored.
</li><li> Elizabeth Warren, a longtime bankruptcy and contract lawyer and Harvard professor, started predicting the 2008 market crash <em>in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a></em>. As the 2000s wore on, she continued to make hay about the issue, but was roundly ignored by everyone. In 2010, she became the main architect of a consumer advocacy agency designed to prevent such a thing from happening again, and in 2012, she was elected as Massachusetts' junior Democratic Senator.
</li><li> Michael Burry and John Paulson were hedge fund managers who, in the mid-'00s, independently crunched the numbers and saw that the American housing bubble was on track to burst in a few years. Both of them proceeded to short the market in anticipation that firms like Citigroup and Bear Stearns that were up to their noses in subprime mortgages would collapse under the weight of millions of foreclosures, a bet that made them and their investors hundreds of millions of dollars in 2008. Burry was the subject of the book <em>The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine</em> by Michael Lewis (which was later adapted into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBigShort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBigShort">a feature film</a>), while Paulson was the subject of <em>The Greatest Trade Ever</em> by Gregory Zuckerman.
</li><li> Likewise in the UK, Liberal Democrat MP Dr Vince Cable (that doctorate is a PhD in economics) spent the later years of the Blair government and the early years of the Brown one warning of "casino banking" exposing the London Stock Exchange and UK banking sector to huge risk. Cue the 2008 financial meltdown, and after the election of the Coalition government in 2010, Cable became the Rt. Hon Secretary of State for business. The trope was then redoubled as large parts of the Conservative Party chose to ignore him because he's a Liberal Democrat. (Politics can be messy.)
</li></ul></li><li> Slightly subverted by Hussein Kamil Hassan al-Majid, Saddam's son-in-law and head of Iraq's WMD program. His statements about the progress Iraq's WMD programs had made surprised intelligence agencies but was accepted. His statements that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9509/iraq_defector/kamel_transcript/index.html">Iraq's WMD were destroyed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on the other hand...
<ul><li> The UN Weapons Inspectors who went into Iraq in 2002-2003 would fit as well. They pointed out that many claims of Iraq possessing WMD were invalid or wrong. After saying they needed a few months to continue inspections, they were ordered to leave (not by Iraq, but by the US) in 2003...
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/knew/">John O'Neil,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> an FBI agent who saw <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The War on Terror</a> (including the 9/11 attacks) coming roughly a decade ahead of time but was ignored. In a fit of tragic irony, he ended up working as security of the World Trade Center and ended up dying in the same attacks he predicted. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">He was last seen running back into the WTC to get more people out.</a>
<ul><li> However he designed emergency evacuation plans for such an attack. These plans are the reason there are so many survivors.
</li></ul></li><li> There were many studies that warned <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Electric_Power_Company">TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power Company)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of safety flaws in their Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, most notably that the seawall protecting the plant was insufficient if a powerful enough tsunami occurred. All of these were ignored by TEPCO officials, leaving the plant vulnerable to the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, resulting in the worst nuclear disaster since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Usefulnotes/Chernobyl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Usefulnotes/Chernobyl">Chernobyl</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sony">Sony</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/33349q/wikileaks_have_published_kevin_feiges_notes_for/">was given<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/JoshWildingNewsAndReviews/news/?a=112638">notes by<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Studios</a> head Kevin Feige and Marvel Entertainment president Alan Fine about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan2">The Amazing Spider-Man 2</a></em>. Some of Feige's tweaks were used, but Fine was completely ignored. When one compares Feige and Fine's suggestions to critiques of the finished product, one finds a lot of them (Gwen Stacy's death is pointless and harms the film, there are too many villains, the story is too dark, too much emphasis on Peter's heritage, retreads a lot of old ground) intact.
</li><li> John Yudkin, a British nutritionist, argued heavily that sugar consumption was the cause of heart disease and obesity, not fat, as prevailing scientific thought believed. He was ignored, largely because nutritional scientists were being paid off by the sugar industry.
</li><li> All of the above aside, it should be noted that conclusions and beliefs that seem obvious to one expert, particularly in fields such as economics or political science, may seem like complete idiocy to another. The experts themselves can heatedly debate theories and courses of action, each insisting that they are correct. In some cases, the experts' predictions have proven to be <em>wrong</em>, and ignoring them would in hindsight have been a better course of action.
</li><li> Any case of a parent warning their children about the consequences of their actions. Like eating too much confectionery and getting cavities. Bundling up before playing in the winter to avoid catching a cold. The list goes on. Many a teenager or young adult will acknowledge this and often say they wish they'd listened to their parents.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirLenin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirLenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> insisted that Russia could both industrialize and transition to full Communism at the same time. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx">Karl Marx</a>, on the other hand, saw capitalism as a necessary step that came before socialism and Communism. Marx believed Russia was too agrarian and underdeveloped to become Communist. What ended up happening was, the USSR was able to industrialize fairly quickly within thirty years of being Socialist, but the inefficiencies of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephStalin">Stalin's</a> command economy resulted in tens of millions of deaths.
</li><li> During the filming of the "Time Out" episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwilightZoneTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwilightZoneTheMovie">Twilight Zone: The Movie</a></em>, one scene entails a man played by Vic Morrow escorting two Vietnamese children through a bombed-out village while a US Army helicopter pursues and bombs explode around them; Director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnLandis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnLandis">John Landis</a> was advised numerous times by his safety officials and <em>the pilot himself</em> that the helicopter was too close to the explosions, but Landis ignored them. What followed was <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_Zone_accident">one of the most infamous incidents<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in filming history as the helicopter became damaged by the explosions and crashed down on Morrow and the children, decapitating him and one child and crushing the under beneath the helicopter. Despite being charged with manslaughter, Landis was acquitted, but it snuffed out his directing career.
</li><li> In a 2015 TED Talk, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates warned that another pandemic will occur in the next 50 to 100 years and that the world is not prepared. He warned that a new disease outbreak will be worse than the Ebola and Zika virus epidemics and will cripple vital supply chains. Unfortunately for the world, Gate was proven correct with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/COVID19Pandemic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/COVID19Pandemic">COVID-19 Pandemic</a> that resulted in 22.5 million infected cases and 790,000 deaths with supply chains being overwhelmed and massive recessions.
</li><li> In 2014, Moldovan-registered cargo ship MV <em>Rhosus</em> arrived in Beirut, Lebanon. Due to various issues, the ship was deemed not sea worthy and forbidden to set sail, with its crew repatriated over the time period of a year and the cargo, 2750 tons of ammonium nitrate originally ordered by an African explosives company for use in mining explosives, was brought onboard and stored in Warehouse 12. For a period of six years after that, customs officials at the port repeatedly requested to judges that the cargo be exported, sold to a private Lebanese company, or given to the Army, citing the severe safety risk posed by improperly storing ammonium nitrate in the hot climate of Lebanon. Their pleas go unheeded, and the cargo remained where it was, becoming an accident waiting to happen.... <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Beirut_explosions">and one happened<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on August 4, 2020, where a fire caused two explosions, the second of which was registered as among the most powerful non-nuclear explosions in history, powerful enough to be heard 250km away in Cyprus, registering as a magnitude 3.3 event by the United States Geological Survey. It killed at least 220 people, injured 7000, left 300000 homeless, and caused $10-15 billion in damages. The blast also destroyed 80 percent of Lebanon's grain reserves and disabled a major commerce hub for the country, leaving the country with only a month's supply of grain, and exacerbating the economic woes faced by a country already struggling with a financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.
