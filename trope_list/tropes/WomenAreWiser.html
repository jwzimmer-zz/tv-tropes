This is most common in comedy but occasionally turns up in other genres.
</p><p>Note that this trope is not about any specific instance of individual female characters being particularly sensible, but about depictions in which female characters are <em>automatically</em> positioned as more levelheaded than their male counterparts.
</p><p>This is often not a net positive trope for the female characters themselves: while in some works it is invoked as an honest attempt to refute the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnipresentTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnipresentTrope">omnipresent trope</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreBetterThanWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreBetterThanWomen">Men Are Better Than Women</a>, it often has the effect (especially in comedy) of shifting the burden of responsibility onto women for the actions of everyone around them as well as themselves. Men can be portrayed as undeserving of blame for making an interpersonal mistake or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenCantKeepHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenCantKeepHouse">not knowing how to do a chore</a>, because women are supposedly just naturally better at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableFeminineGoalsAndTraits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableFeminineGoalsAndTraits">that sort of thing</a>. A common version of this is the widely held belief that girl children mature faster than boys, which is used to excuse boys' behavior more often than to commend girls'. It can also pigeonhole them into being less interesting than their male counterparts, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawlessToken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawlessToken">they aren't allowed to be flawed to the same degree</a>: for a classic example, if there's a single woman in a comedy, she will probably be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan">Straight Man</a>, which often translates to her being the most boring character.

The woman patiently explains or demonstrates the superiority of the advertiser's product to the clueless man. This has roots in the resurgence of the middle-class <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Housewife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Housewife">housewife</a> role in the 1950s and '60s, when advertisers knew they could sell more products by convincing women they were experts on consumerism, and to this day it is especially pronounced in cleaning product ads that air during the day and are targeted at housewives.

From the woman standing in the background with what can only be described as a scowl on her face, to the tagline "So easy...even a man could do it!". It's actually rather disgusting.
<ul><li> Said advert received 663 complaints from men <em>and women</em> (men claiming it portrayed them as idiots, women claiming it supported out-of-date stereotypes regarding women and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">kitchen</a>). Amazingly, they were <em>not</em> upheld - which sparked backlash from people saying an opposite advert would be shot down immediately. The <em>Daily Mail</em> had a field day.

It goes just like any other Butterfinger commercial: man tries to steal Butterfinger and suffers the consequences from his friend. In the last three seconds, some random female appears and tells the men, "You guys are idiots." The line offers nothing to the commercial; there was no reason for its inclusion other than to be insulting.
</li><li> The ads for Flash in the UK seem to be aware of this trope such as one had the mother coming home to find the kitchen in a complete mess and storming all over the house looking for her husband. The husband uses this time to quickly clean the kitchen up and then position himself in the living room so that when the wife comes in to scold him about the mess she looks back to see it clean and is left speechless.
</li><li> Seen in one AT&amp;T commercial, where four businesswomen (two of whom are minorities) and one white businessman are looking for a network provider and seek help from a female AT&amp;T employee. Naturally, the women are the ones asking all of the 'smart questions' and displaying any business sense, while the guy is shown to be completely clueless and only going along with what the women are doing.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> Nami, the navigator of the Straw Hat pirates often has to express common sense, since few of her crewmembers, especially her captain Luffy, possess it. On the other hand, Nami has her own blind spots (such as the promise of wealth) and has to be reeled in by the others in turn.
</li><li> Robin, in turn, possesses common sense in spades and lacks the quirks (Robin has her own quirks too, they're just fairly subtle compared to the others') and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> tendencies that Nami has. She tends to stay cool and collected in almost any situation, even when her captain has them haring off on some utterly ridiculous course on a whim. The major difference between her and Nami is that, while Nami tends to try to show the rest of the group how ludicrous their actions are (sometimes coming off as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Woman</a>), Robin is perfectly content to sit back, smile, and read a book while Luffy makes plans to blast the ship and crew into the sky. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComicallySerious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComicallySerious">There is a standing rule in the series that Robin is the only character who is never given exaggerated or cartoony facial expressions. The rest of the crew will often have extreme reactions to whatever insanity they come across, but she maintains the same placid expression</a>. This is less to show her as reasonable and more to emphasize her role as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpock">a detached-to-a-fault intellectual</a>. Except on the rare occasions when she does show strong emotion.

Between the two main leads, Rock is depicted as the moral and level-headed one, whereas Revy is depicted as far more psychotic and emotionally unstable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>: Played straight with Eri Kisaki — the more mature and businesslike ex-wife of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad">Kogoro Mouri</a>, and Miwako Sato — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyEveryDude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyEveryDude">Takagi</a>'s senior love interest. Averted elsewhere among the main couples, since most competitive detectives and phantom thieves are males.
</li><li> Zoe, the only girl from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier">Digimon Frontier</a></em>, usually tends to act more rational and level-headed than all her male teammates. She also was able to control her Beast Spirit right away, whereas they couldn't.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em>: Downplayed. Of the main males, Black Star is an arrogant jerk, Kid is mainly just an obsessed freak over symmetry, and Soul is snarky, impatient, and rude. The main females, Maka, Tsubaki, and Liz, are all practical, level-headed, intelligent, kind, and mature, for the most part; the only exception is Patty, who's a total dunce. Out of the villains, Medusa and Arachne are a lot more level-headed, calm and mature, whereas Crona, Giriko, and Asura are much more on the insane side. In the anime, Maka even outright kicks the male <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> Kishin Asura's ass all by herself and basically saves the world all by herself, while all the males get beaten by him. However, this does not translate to morally superior or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemalesAreMoreInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemalesAreMoreInnocent">more innocent</a> — Medusa, and her sister Shaula from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEaterNot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEaterNot">Soul Eater Not!</a></em>, are a pair of sadistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> sisters who have no redeeming qualities (Medusa in particular being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">abusive</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMatriarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMatriarch">Evil Matriarch</a> to Crona), and they are much worse morally than Asura, who has the excuse of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod">completely insane</a> and thus unable to really control his actions.

<ul><li> Canadian comedian Mike MacDonald had a bit where he said that if men ever declare something "men only", and women are <em>fine with that</em> and don't demand that they also be allowed to participate, then it's obviously something <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">incredibly stupid and dangerous</a> that <em>nobody</em> should be doing.

The pervasive nature of this trope is lampshaded when the male character admits that he's surprised that a female-dominated society didn't abolish war and usher in an age of peace and "standing around in circles holding hands singing 'Kumbaya'."
</li><li> Laurie of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em>, also the only major female character in the main cast, is often the one with the most realistic and logical perspective. She is not bogged down with extreme views of justice like Rorschach is, holds a negative view on irrational behavior (such as Jon wanting to leave humanity to die and Dan's desire to help Rorschach in spite of his horrid behavior). On the other hand, she's also extremely stubborn and at times delusional, refusing to see the truth <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that the Comedian is her father</span> when she had enough evidence and the detective skills to put it all together herself. She can also be weak-willed (her repeated attempts to quit smoking always end in failure). In <em>Watchmen</em>, no one is spared dysfunction.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse">Disney Ducks Comic Universe</a></em> comics:
<ul><li> A truly infuriating example of this trope occurred at one point when the creators of Paperinik decided to give him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a> and thus gave Daisy Duck her own superhero identity of Paperinika. Naturally, a great deal of stories involved them working together. Unfortunately, not only did they end up constantly bickering and hating each other in their secret identities, which was annoying enough on its own, but every time they were together, Paperinik suddenly lost all competence and reverted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> bungling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a> in a costume. Seeing as <em>the whole point of Paperinik's creation</em> was responding to fans' complaints that Donald was always a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> loser, the fans were not pleased with this development, leading to Italy axing Paperinika all together (though she is still used in the Brazilian comics).
<ul><li> Paperinika made a comeback in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ultraheroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ultraheroes">Ultraheroes</a></em> storyline, where all the major Disney comics superheroes teamed up. This time, though, she's been written as even more incompetent than Donald when the two get together; mainly because she is so driven to prove herself Paperinik's equal that she worries about that more than the job at hand, and they end up bickering when they should be saving the day.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PaperinikNewAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PaperinikNewAdventures">Paperinik New Adventures</a></em> this was inverted: it was Paperinik and One that had to keep the angry, vicious Xadhoom in check(you know it bad when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a> thinks you have a temper). Also Everett Ducklair, who despite having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceRelatedMemeticDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceRelatedMemeticDisorder">his own</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">demons</a> is still more well adjusted than his daughters and wife. Same goes for his two main employees, as Anymore is clearly more rational than Birgit.
</li></ul></li><li> Maintained for the large part in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> most of the female characters have far less overwhelming personality defects than the male cast and usually act as the voice of reason for their male comrades. This is especially obvious for Sally, who lost even the key flaws she had in <em>SatAm</em> (see below) to become an overly versatile and collected foil to the far more arrogant and hot-tempered Sonic.
</li><li> Amy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheComic">Sonic the Comic</a></em> was made into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">The Lancer</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">Improbable Aiming Skills</a> due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>. She had few flaws compared to her very flawed male counterparts, and Tekno (another thoroughly competent female character). Ironically her initial persona was surprisingly close to the lovesick <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass">Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass</a> Amy of the later games. While Amy herself is a much more abrasive character in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">American Sonic comics</a>, it plays this straight with a fair few other characters. Sally and Bunnie are usually more rational and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloserToEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloserToEarth">Closer to Earth</a> than many male Freedom Fighters, who are often harbored by significant flaws like arrogance or temper issues, meanwhile the female leads' shortcomings are often more minor or down to circumstance than deep personality issues (e.g. Bunnie's robotization, Sally's responsibilities as leader and monarch). Julie Su leans less into this vein, more or less acting as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a> to Knuckles, though is still <em>slightly</em> more rational than him.
</li></ul></li><li> In one of the oddest examples of this trope the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArchieComics">Archie Comics</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenAge">Golden Age</a> character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Suzie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Suzie">Suzie</a> ended up like this. Suzie first appeared as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde">Dumb Blonde</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Ms. Fanservice</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthologyComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthologyComic">Anthology Comic</a> <em>Top Notch Comics</em> in 1942 and proved so popular she eventually took over the comic which was renamed after her and ran until 1954 as <em>Suzie Comics</em>. In the mid-Forties, she gained a supporting cast including her clueless, loser boyfriend Ferdie who quickly became a one man <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Spotlight-Stealing Squad</a> - by the early Fifties he was arguably the real star and Suzie had become a supporting character in her own book. What made it surreal was that in the few late-era strips that <em>didn't</em> feature Ferdie Suzie acted like her original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainlessBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainlessBeauty">Brainless Beauty</a> self. In the Ferdie strips, on the other hand, she suddenly gained several dozen IQ points to act as the straight woman to his antics.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Lucifer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Lucifer">Lucifer</a></em>, the titular character creates a new universe and populates it with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamAndEveStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamAndEveStory">a single man and woman</a>. He tries to convince them to act according to their desires and worship no one, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopWorshippingMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopWorshippingMe">not even him</a>. In subverting the traditional Adam and Eve story, it plays this trope straight: here, it is the man who falls from grace and brings the woman down with him. The man decides that desire is evil, posits the existence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">a greater creator</a> beyond Lucifer, and decides to flagellate himself and dedicate his suffering to that creator. Lucifer destroys him as a flawed creation; the woman chooses to join him in death rather than accept a newly-created companion.
</li><li> Most of the women characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Valhalla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Valhalla">Valhalla</a></em> are wiser than their male counterparts and tend to avoid the mental pit-traps that the men fall into thanks to their pride and stubbornness. This is particularly noticeable with Frigg, Odin's wife, whose role in the original mythology was also to be the voice of reason to her husband.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWickedAndTheDivine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWickedAndTheDivine">The Wicked + The Divine</a></em> does this with Woden - of the three incarnations of them we've seen, the only female one (Romantic Era) is the only one who isn't a complete and utter piece of shit. (The early-twentieth-century one was based on <em>Joseph Goebbels</em>.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a></em> plays with this, mostly because her creator firmly believed women to be more truthful, kind and less violent and the Amazons of Paradise Island were designed as an example of just how much better things would be with women in charge.
<ul><li> Enforced by Athena in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987">Wonder Woman (1987)</a></em>. In the backstory, Hippolyta and the Amazons were once enslaved by the demi-god <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HerculesUnbound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HerculesUnbound">Heracles</a> and his men (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineConflict">sent by Ares in his war against Athena</a>) and used as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">sex slaves</a>. Athena freed Hippolyta on the condition that the Amazons would not seek revenge, but Heracles escaped anyway.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot">FoxTrot</a></em>, Roger is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad">buffoon</a> who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">unaware of his own incompetence</a>, while Andy is responsible and fairly intelligent, even if she is somewhat obsessed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef">bizarre tofu concoctions</a>.
<ul><li> Actually this is more of a subversion as Andy <em>thinks</em> she is closer to earth but upon closer inspection of her character is actually no better or worse than the rest of her family. Her own flaws are that she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">fearful and overreactive of entertainment media</a>, occasionally hypocritical, misinterprets her kids' character, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">refuses to turn up the heater in the winter</a>. Oh yes, and the cooking.

While the entire cast usually winds up playing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan">Straight Man</a> to Calvin, the other male leads still tend to be funnier than their female counterparts. (For instance: <a class="urllink" href="http://www.s-anand.net/blog/calvin-and-hobbes-dad-explains-science/">Dad explains science.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) Susie Derkins, in particular, exhibits a surprisingly mature sensibility at times when she's not actively fighting with Calvin, does much better at schoolwork, and is good at spotting glaring flaws in Calvin's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme">Zany Schemes</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield">Garfield</a></em> has a typical example in Jon and Liz, although, to be fair, Garfield himself is also more sensible than Jon. (Hell, it could be possible that even <em>Odie</em> might be more sensible than Jon. That's very ironic, considering Odie's not exactly very bright himself anyway.)
</li><li> For the first several years of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Retail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Retail">Retail</a></em>, women in positions of authority (Marla, Val, Connie, Lara) were always portrayed positively, as intelligent, caring, sensible, and fair-minded leaders. By contrast, men in positions of authority were all depicted negatively - Stuart and Josh are arrogant Corporate stooges, Jerry a misogynist, Gary insisted on holding annoying and useless training seminars, and Bradley a gloating, insufferable jerkass who tried to steal his competitor's employees.
<ul><li> As of late 2013, this trend has diminished somewhat, with Cooper's promotion to stockroom supervisor and the introduction of the Delman's managers, the sympathetic Greg and the manipulative backstabber, Mina.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Blondie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Blondie">Blondie</a></em>, the title character runs both the household and her own catering business, the latter with Herb's wife Tootsie. Dagwood chronically wakes up late for work, is considered a screwup by his boss, and has no plans past his next snacktime. The couple was cut off from the sizable Bumstead family fortune when he married below his station, but it would appear she's adjusted to the change much better than he has.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Pondus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Pondus">Pondus</a></em> has two straight examples: Beate for Pondus and Camilla for Jokke. Both women are clearly more sane than their men.

At the same time, he says that she is the far more sensible of the two and is able to remain calm even in the worst of situations, knowing just what to say to make her husband feel better.

</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Brave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Brave">Brave</a></em> with Queen Elinor. While she's obviously the better administrator than her husband and can pacify the tensions between the four clans, the central conflict in the story is due to her being too obstinate to see the world from her daughter's point of view. Her husband Fergus, on the other hand, understands his daughter very well and tries to get Elinor to realize this when he pretended to be Merida in one scene.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKingIISimbasPride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKingIISimbasPride">The Lion King II: Simba's Pride</a></em> with the now queen Nala, something that exasperated most fans of her previous portrayal, and even her small daughter Kiara in regards to Simba. On the other hand, Simba not being particularly wise by any standard is a big part of the plot.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IceAge2TheMeltdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IceAge2TheMeltdown">Ice Age 2: The Meltdown</a></em> as Manny is the one playing straight man to Ellie but used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IceAge3DawnOfTheDinosaurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IceAge3DawnOfTheDinosaurs">Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IceAge4ContinentalDrift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IceAge4ContinentalDrift">Ice Age 4: Continental Drift</a></em> with Ellie and Peaches as Manny is always freaking out about something while Ellie keeps calming him down and playing straight man to him by calming him down and telling him everything will be alright.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnAutumnAfternoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnAutumnAfternoon">An Autumn Afternoon</a></em>, Akiko is much more sensible than her husband Koichi when it comes to financial matters.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InAWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InAWorld">In a World...</a>...</em>: All men in the film are either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawMisogynist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawMisogynist">Straw Misogynist</a> assholes (Gustav) or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy">so diffident and non-threatening as to be effectively neutered</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DemetriMartin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DemetriMartin">Demetri Martin</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobCorddry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobCorddry">Rob Corddry</a>'s characters). The latter is presented as the "good" alternative, and Sam Soto's transition from the former to the latter is presented as character development. The women aren't presented as perfect—witness Dani's guilt over cheating on her husband or Carol starting the movie as a semi-employed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">Woman Child</a> still living with Daddy at 32—but they're still presented as more competent than and morally superior to the men.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KnockedUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KnockedUp">Knocked Up</a></em>, female lead Alison is a smart, driven, competent, responsible career woman and male lead Ben is a lazy stoner coasting off of an injury settlement and sporadically working on a web site with a specious business model. The arc of the film is mostly about Ben settling down to become worthy of Alison. The trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed">deconstructed</a> by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaCouple">Beta Couple</a>, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">resemble the Alpha Couple turned</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>.

</li><li> In the poster for the Katherine Heigl film <em>Life as We Know It</em>, Josh Duhamel is walking around in a nappy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMaxFuryRoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMaxFuryRoad">Mad Max: Fury Road</a></em> takes this to its logical extreme: Every single villain is male and all of the women, particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMessWithGranny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMessWithGranny">the Vuvalini</a> are heroic and wise about the world; and/or victims.

<ul><li> This is somewhat downplayed as Max is the one who does a lot of the fighting before they meet the Vulvani because he's the only combatant besides Furiosa. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When Nux joins he also proves to be very useful as well.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MinorityReport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MinorityReport">Minority Report</a></em>, John Anderton asks the creator of the Precog system, Dr. Hineman, which Precog would have his minority report that depicts his innocence. Hineman responds that it would be the most gifted of the three. When John asks her which one would that be, she smiles and says in an "of course" manner, "The female."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MirrorMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MirrorMask">MirrorMask</a></em>:
<ul><li> Morris and Joanne Campbell. To quote the book version, "Dad's got his head in the clouds. Mum's got her feet on the ground."
</li><li> Also Helena and Valentine; Helena is intelligent, friendly, and mostly fair to everyone she meets. Valentine, while very likable, is rather scheming and often self-centered.
</li><li> This is shown again by the floating giant couple, whose balance keeps them in equilibrium; when they become uncoupled the female sinks into the ground while her mate helplessly floats away.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mortdecai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mortdecai">Mortdecai</a></em>, while Charlie is bumbling, arrogant and often moronic, his wife Johanna is by far more mature and intelligent.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">Defied</a> and mocked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Neighbors2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Neighbors2014">Neighbors</a></em>, by Kelly when Mac asks her why she's not reining in his crazy revenge fantasies — she herself has those same urges. Nearly every review of the movie (even the negative ones) praised it for doing this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Seth Rogen stated in an interview</a> that the wife character was written in the usual way until he showed his real wife the script and she pointed out that she'd get just as into it as he did.

</li><li> Mutsuta's wife in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sanjuro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sanjuro">Sanjuro</a></em> is smarter than most of the men in the movie, save for Sanjuro and Mutsuta, and teaches Sanjuro a thing or two about violence. He tries to take her advice to heart.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SaveMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SaveMe">SAVE ME</a></em>, where Gayle (the only significant female character) appears at the beginning as the driving spiritual force of Genesis House, but her personal motives are deconstructed over the course of the film, until she's shown to be at least as messed up as any of the men she is supposedly helping. That her husband Ted is shown to be more reasonable and reserved about the work they're doing, and more cognizant of her rather tangled motives for doing it, heightens the subversion.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThing2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThing2011">The Thing (2011)</a></em>. Juliette is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveToBelieveMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveToBelieveMe">only person who believes Kate</a> when she says the alien is disguised as one of them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">That's because she's already been assimilated and is luring her someplace quiet to do the same.</span>

The first man wishes to become ten times smarter and the second man wishes to become a hundred times smarter. The third man wishes he was a thousand times smarter...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and turns into a woman.</span> Like many jokes of this type, of course, it's often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Inverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Inverted">inverted</a> depending on the gender of the person telling it.
</li><li> Science develops the first working brain transplant. A woman's brain can be as low as $3000, while men's brains are often worth five times that much. When questioned about this, the scientist answers "Well, that's because women's brains have been used."

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder9');">    Literature </div><div class="folder" id="folder9" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Played straight in Bernard Werber's short story "Un jour, il n'y aura que des femmes sur terre" (One day, there will only be women on Earth), in which the protagonists see glimpses of the future in which all men died after a nuclear explosion, and genetically engineered women who reproduce asexually go on the form a perfect society free of wars, famine, envy, living closer to Mother Nature.
</li><li> Completely averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice">A Brother's Price</a></em>. The population is about 90% women, and it is not better than a world ruled by men. The only thing that's better is that women are safe from rape <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaritalRapeLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaritalRapeLicense">unless they are married</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CreationManAndTheMessiah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CreationManAndTheMessiah">Creation Man And The Messiah</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenrikWergeland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenrikWergeland">Henrik Wergeland</a> <em>runs</em> on this trope. The entire human race is ensouled by a male spirit, Phun-Abiriel, who took abode in Adam because he wanted to rule a "lesser" world than the spiritual one, and a female spirit, Ohebiel, who likewise took abode in Eve. She did this because she feared that humanity would be utterly lost without her spiritual guidance. And true to form, the influence of Ohebiel serves to make humanity wiser and is possibly the route to salvation because this spiritual element is necessary for the spiritual development of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a> when he becomes the saviour. Thus, the female part of the human soul is essential for humanity to survive.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCrichton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCrichton">Michael Crichton</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Disclosure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Disclosure">Disclosure</a></em> is entirely built around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inverting</a> this trope, with a piggish and sexually abusive female boss as the primary antagonist.
</li><li> This is one of the primary differences between witches and wizards in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a>, particularly in the way they use magic. Wizards tend to be flashy and theatrical and have a social structure based on academia; witches have more sensible, practical magic and more commonly take on the roles of local midwives or herbalists. Not just the witches and wizards. The women of the Discworld are almost invariably smart and down to earth. There is the occasional one-off ditz, but there are no 'comic loser' female main characters in the spirit of Rincewind or Nobby; even Magrat, perhaps the closest a Discworld heroine comes to subverting this trope, is still a highly skilled witch and badass in her own way once you get through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GranolaGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GranolaGirl">the New Age satire</a>.
<ul><li> In a Nac Mac Feegle clan, it's the Kelda's job, as the only female, to do the thinking for the entire tribe since male Feegles aren't that good at it.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0g892');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0g892" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0g892');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em>An</em> implication being that in each clan, each gender gets a certain amount of intelligence and "smarts" that gets divvied up: since there's usually only one (or two, counting a daughter) women, the womenfolk keep it all, but since there are hundreds of son's and brothers to share their intelligence....</span>
</li><li> The trope is discussed and zigzagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonstrousRegiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonstrousRegiment">Monstrous Regiment</a></em>. Whilst it's true that the day is ultimately saved by the efforts of the disguised female soldiers, it's also pointed out repeatedly, both explicitly and subtly, that women can be just as stupid, petty and cruel as the men around them. This is particularly emphasized by the climatic reveal that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">over a third of the High Command are women, and they haven't done a <em>thing</em> to stop the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalWar">Eternal War</a> devastating their country</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The three holiest characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy">The Divine Comedy</a></em> (outside of God) are the Virgin Mary, Saint Lucia, and Beatrice. These three women orchestrate and allow Dante's descent through the afterlives even though he and Virgil frequently fail and need to divine intervention to get through. Not only does Saint Lucia at one point need to carry Dante up Purgatory, but Beatrice spends nearly every canto of <em>Paradiso</em> admonishing Dante's flawed conceptions of God and correcting him with the help of the other saints.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a></em>, though this largely depends on which version you read. In the original 1818 edition Victor is cold, callous and foolish, but his father Alphonse is the perfect father and his friend Clerval is the perfect youth, full of life and vibrance. The second version turns Victor himself much more sympathetic, and Elizabeth is turned into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuritySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuritySue">Purity Sue</a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GKChesterton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GKChesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a>'s heroines have a tendency to be more sensible than his heroes. While they can rise to the occasion in times of crisis, they have much higher standards than his heroes for what qualifies as a crisis. This was also very much a conscious belief held by Chesterton.
</li><li> In Mario Puzo's book, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a></em> says it specifically.

</li></ul><ul><li> <em>The Small Back Room</em>, by Nigel Balchin. The protagonist is a decent but weak-willed scientist struggling with alcoholism and the political infighting of his colleagues. His girlfriend (his bosses' secretary) has a lot more common sense, being able to see how his superiors are manipulating him, but unable to convince him to take action. At the end of the novel, he drearily concludes that he'll just leave all the decisions to her from now on.

Cersei´s only saving grace is her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">Mama Bear</a> attitude towards her children, but is overshadowed by her atrocious actions. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">TV show</a> she has a slightly more sympathetic portrayal, as some of her most evil acts in the book are performed by Joffrey instead.

</li><li> Galadriel plays with this trope. She has an ability to perceive the minds and hearts of others, which would naturally fall under this trope. However, in her youth, she was nonetheless as brash and hotheaded as even the Sons of Fëanor, and openly joined the rebellion against the Valar with the rest of them because she desired lands of her own to rule. She remained in Middle-earth after the First Age because, as one of the leaders of the revolt, she wasn't <em>allowed</em> to sail into the West with the rest of the Noldor. That she ends up in the role of Melian come the Third Age — guiding and helping Elrond, Gandalf, Aragorn, Frodo, and Sam — is because her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">Heel Realization</a> and spending millennia "fighting the long defeat" as penance for her actions have mellowed her considerably.

She is infinitely more mature and capable than her loser ex-husband. When she goes up against Alan's brother Charlie, he may get his way sometimes but she is still portrayed as the one with the level-headed opinion in the argument. Judith is more capable than Alan but she is also <em>far</em> more vindictive than him and takes sadistic delight in humiliating him at any opportunity.

On top of which, the characters were written to invert standard gender tropes, with Mulder in the more emotional field of psychology and Scully as an MD (not that this always shows up in the show).
</li><li> Tim and Jill Taylor in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement">Home Improvement</a></em>, especially in the earlier seasons. This was softened a bit as the series went on, and Jill had several of her own moments of incompetence. For example, when Al's mother passed away, Jill's advice only makes things worse while Tim is more comforting and practical.
<ul><li> One episode ended with <em>both</em> of them realizing they were wrong. It involved Tim forgetting to do something, and the episode had both of them blaming the other for it. Jill left him a lot of clues and hints but, after talking to Wilson, realized she never actually outright <em>told</em> Tim to do it (and after so many years of marriage, she should know that he's not big on clues). Despite Jill realizing she was wrong, only Tim apologized; Jill played it off as if she had been right all along, and thus this trope was preserved.
</li></ul></li><li> Jess from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Misfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Misfits">Misfits</a></em> acts much more grounded and less eccentric than the other characters, often causing conflict between her and them.
</li><li> This trope is subverted in Tim Allen's other sitcom <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastManStanding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastManStanding">Last Man Standing</a></em>. In most episodes, Mike is the most rational person in the house and turns out to be right at the end, while his wife Vanessa is prone to making stupid mistakes because of her pride and over eagerness to help people.
</li><li> Debra and Ray Barone in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EverybodyLovesRaymond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EverybodyLovesRaymond">Everybody Loves Raymond</a></em> take this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>, as the show began dumbing Ray down and making him borderline helpless (he was very smart and snarky in the earlier seasons) in order to pander to Debra's fans by using the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentingTheHusband" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentingTheHusband">Parenting the Husband</a> trope. In other words, Ray was derailed in order to prop up the Debra character with this trope. Ironically though, it's not always a case of Debra being right, but her simply being <em>louder</em>, especially in the later seasons...however the show often makes it clear that the audience is supposed to side with Debra and treat her as being super-intelligent, even though in practice she frequently makes big mistakes (forcing Ray to move across the street from Marie for instance), and despite the fact that she can be quite cruel and abusive.
<ul><li> Somewhat inverted in one episode featuring Debra trying to get Ray to agree to couples counseling with the idea that she would try to get him to see her point of view. It ends up being the opposite when Ray starts to open up to the therapist, and Debra ends up being the one on the spot. And yes, she refuses to go do it again since the therapist didn't side with her...but again, the show tries to portray her as being 100% justified yet again.
</li></ul></li><li> Both played straight and completely subverted, averted, and parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGeorgeLopezShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGeorgeLopezShow">The George Lopez Show</a></em>, which has Angie often be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloserToEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloserToEarth">Closer to Earth</a> counter to George's impulsiveness, but she is in no way always right have the best way of doing things; she may be the more sensible, but she is also overly optimistic and somewhat naive, while George lacks foresight but, while overly cynical, is more of a realist.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em> inverted it early on with Piper and Leo's relationship where Piper is the neurotic and obsessive one while Leo often has to try and calm her down most of the time. However, Leo gets baggage of his own in later seasons making them both disasters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly">iCarly</a></em>: Played straight with Carly and Spencer, with Carly being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloserToEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloserToEarth">Closer to Earth</a> and Spencer impulsive and occasionally stupid, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flip</a> with Freddie and Sam, with Freddie being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> most of the time, with Sam being a destructive force of nature.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LizzieMcGuire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LizzieMcGuire">Lizzie McGuire</a></em> plays it totally straight. "Calm down, Matt, we're just trying to fool dad. It's not like we're trying to fool mom!" Jo is often dorky but is nearly always right, especially in comparison to Sam.
<ul><li> Inverted in one episode when her father manages to get Lizzie to open up to him, which Jo has been trying her hardest and failing to do, by simply sitting there and listening to her. It is meant as a lesson for Jo who realises that she has to listen to her daughter instead of just 'telling her' whats wrong with her.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight both ways in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKingOfQueens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKingOfQueens">The King of Queens</a></em>, where Doug is foolish and impulsive, but Carrie is somewhat immoral (or at least self-serving) and brash, and, in episodes that showcase each's flaws, the other will be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloserToEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloserToEarth">Closer to Earth</a>.
</li><li> Played straight with Carl from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters">Family Matters</a></em>. For example, in one episode, Carl claims he doesn't need help with cooking equipment, against Harriet's advice. Before the scene is over, the griller outside accidentally crashes into the house. Basically, Harriet is right and Carl is wrong, you get the picture.
<ul><li> One episode has Carl actually give Harriet good advice: don't leave your ring near the sink. She ignores it, and then a bit later believes she's knocked the ring down the drain. Carl reveals instead that he moved her ring somewhere safer... and then he fumbles it and it goes down the drain. His advice is therefore nullified and the episode can conclude with Harriet delivering her usual "Carl, you moron" expression.
</li><li> Meanwhile, among the younger generation, Laura is both smart and sensible, while Urkel is brilliant but socially incompetent, and Eddie and Waldo are just dense all around.
</li></ul></li><li> Deputies Kimball and Johnson from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Reno911" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Reno911">Reno 911!</a></em> are arguably the most competent officers on the force, having almost made actual arrests, while Williams tends toward oblivious and Weigel is a headcase. The men are also fairly incompetent, including Lieutenant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewToy">Chew Toy</a>.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SisterSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SisterSister">Sister, Sister</a></em>. Ray is sensible, and Lisa is more impulsive and reckless.
<ul><li> Inverted again in the last two seasons, where the girls' steady boyfriends, especially Tamera's boyfriend Jordan, tended to be the more levelheaded straight men to their misadventures.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted by Maria's parents Alan and Chrissie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSarahJaneAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSarahJaneAdventures">The Sarah Jane Adventures</a></em> where Alan is the morally superior one. Of course, Sarah Jane Smith is more of a dependable mother figure than Chrissie and is a good mother to her own adopted son, so it's not like the show is devoid of a moral mother.
<ul><li> Inverted again by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">Rani's</a> parents. Gita is well-meaning and sweet, but she comes off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">The Ditz</a>, and the less said about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">how she handles her encounter with aliens</span>, the better. Haresh is the grounded, reasonable but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SternTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SternTeacher">Stern Teacher</a> and rock of the family, and in contrast to his wife, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">takes the alien encounter in stride and doesn't obsess over it</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> itself tends to go backwards and forwards on this depending on the era of the show you're watching:
<ul><li> Avoided during the majority of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamHartnell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamHartnell">William Hartnell</a>'s era, where most male-female companion teams (Ian and Barbara, Vicki and Steven, Steven and Dodo) were either equals in wisdom or were both intelligent in radically different ways, but hit hard with Ben and Polly - they have the running gag that they disagree on virtually everything and that whenever they do, Ben is wrong and Polly is right. Troughton's second male-female team, Jamie and Victoria, is a bit more balanced, as both are fairly brave and while Victoria is cleverer and more insightful, Jamie is more wary and cunning, and they both look after each other depending on who has the upper hand. His third, Jamie and Zoe, portrays Jamie as somewhere between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FearlessFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FearlessFool">Fearless Fool</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">Cloud Cuckoo Lander</a> with him getting a comedy bit about his stupidity <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode">Once an Episode</a>, while Zoe is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleGenius">Impossible Genius</a> who treats Jamie with condescension and can talk to the Doctor as an equal.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS14E2TheHandOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS14E2TheHandOfFear">The Hand of Fear</a>", Eldrad's female incarnation is manipulative, communicative and able to be reasoned with, despite her murderous impulses. The Doctor even seems quite fond of her, which Sarah jokes about. Upon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor">regenerating</a> into a male body, Eldrad turns into an idiotic, yowling, uncreative maniac with embarrassingly predictable emotions who is eventually defeated by tripping him up.
</li><li> Subverted with Rose and Mickey. At first, we see Rose as being brave, kind and able to stand up to the Doctor while Mickey is a comedy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Coward</a> and hopelessly ill-fit for the Doctor's lifestyle, and the Doctor treats them both with this attitude. Mickey soon demonstrates extreme intelligence in some ways (such as hacking skills) despite the Doctor's continuing condescension. By the second series, he's mostly demonstrating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">brave and mature side</a> we had previously missed, and the Doctor realises he underestimated him enormously. Around the same time, we also start to see a slightly harsher side to Rose; the longer she travels with the Doctor, the more she becomes rather selfish, smug and codependent with him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a>'s tenure has shown a particular tendency towards this trope due to his background in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarsAndVenusGenderContrast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarsAndVenusGenderContrast">Mars-and-Venus Gender Contrast</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexComedy">Sex Comedy</a> and enjoyment of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfSnark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfSnark">World of Snark</a> — just look at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolanderish</a> Eleventh Doctor compared with Amy, River, and Clara, for example. An even clearer example is Vastra, Jenny and Strax - Vastra makes sexist comments about the innate stupidity of men and is an elegant genius who claims to be the inspiration for Sherlock Holmes, while the only man on the team (Strax) is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">The Ditz</a> and doesn't understand concepts like biological sex or that not every problem can be solved by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenUseViolenceWomenUseCommunication" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenUseViolenceWomenUseCommunication">invading the source with an army</a>.

Clara spends most of the episode trying to keep them calm and focused on the threat of the week (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassThePopcorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassThePopcorn">except at the very beginning</a> before she knew there was a threat). It's to the point that when the three get captured, a guard arrives to take the rebel leader to see the Sheriff. While the Doctor and Robin are arguing over which of them is <em>obviously</em> the leader, Clara just lets the guard unlock her shackles and leaves with him.

Pleased with herself, she says "I love monkeys, they're so funny" - when Jenny calls her out on calling humans 'monkeys', Vastra responds that people are <em>apes</em> and <em>men</em> are monkeys. Never mind that the Doctor is a member of a powerfully psychic race and usually in reasonable command of his powers, Vastra can beat him entirely by virtue of being a woman.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1r0qu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1r0qu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1r0qu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Doctor was completely out of it mentally, which probably didnt help his psychic defenses. Vastras mind, on the other hand, was powerful, trained, and <em>prepared</em>.</span>

When Clara suggests calling the President of the United States instead, it's mentioned that the President is female too. Gender-flipped at the end of the episode when Danny Pink provides the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealMenWearPink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealMenWearPink">traditional female comforting role</a> and Clara asks him how he became so wise.
</li><li> With regards to Moffat, note also how Missy, his version of the Master, is both the only female incarnation of the character and the only one to seriously come close to performing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> On the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHoneymooners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHoneymooners">The Honeymooners</a></em>, Ralph and Alice.
</li><li> Turk and Carla of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a></em>. Nine times out of ten, any problems that arise in their relationship are caused by Turk. On the rare occasion that Carla is the cause of the problem, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">she'll get her way anyway</a>. For example, an episode where Carla learned that she had to compromise with Turk instead of making all the decisions herself ended with her getting the car she wanted anyway; that's right: in the end, <em>Turk</em> was the one who made the compromise.
</li><li> This was the original plan with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia">It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</a></em>, with Dee being the comparatively sane voice of reason, but the actress Kaitlin Olsen insisted that she be given as many wacky hijinks to do as the guys, both because it's more fun and because any sane, sensible person wouldn't be hanging out with The Gang in the first place. Past the first season, Dee ends up just as selfish and dimwitted as the others, though she does tend to hold the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartBall">Smart Ball</a> a bit more often than her companions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes">(as they rarely listen to her)</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackBooks">Black Books</a></em>, Fran likes to <em>think</em> that she's more sophisticated and superior to Bernard and Manny, but she's ultimately just as bad as Bernard, and in many ways worse. Of the three, Manny's actually the nicest and most decent person which, of course, just means that the other two ruthlessly exploit him.
</li><li> Definitely in play in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey">Downton Abbey</a></em> as Cora, Mrs. Hughes, Anna, and Sybil are all far more resonable and sensible than their male counterparts Robert, Carson, Bates and Branson who are stubbornly traditionalist or emotionally impulsive.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Extras" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Extras">Extras</a></em>, where Maggie's pretty dim compared to Andy (but probably brighter than Darren). She is, however, shown to be a bit nicer, especially after Andy's let fame go to his head a bit.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em>:
<ul><li> Dr. Cameron is often the voice of morality in House's medical team. However, her morals are often a bit questionable. She also tends to be pretty self-important and stuck up.
</li><li> Cuddy, as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Team Mom</a>, seems more sensible and moral than House. It just so happens that he generally turns out to be right. However, Wilson fills a fairly similar role to Cuddy despite being male, although he sometimes lets House get away with things due to being his friend or needs a telling off from Cuddy himself.
</li><li> After Cameron leaves House's team, the female doctors who wind up replacing her are this too. Thirteen and Adams (both of whom are accused of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">Suspiciously Similar Substitutes</a> to Cameron) are often the voice of moral outrage to House's insane treatment of his patients. In one episode, Cuddy seems annoyed when House <em>doesn't</em> have a female on his team, explaining that he needs one to keep a moral voice.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Mostly</em> subverted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace">Will &amp; Grace</a></em>, where Leo (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicLifePartners">and Will</a>) are shown to be more down to earth than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsympatheticComedyProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsympatheticComedyProtagonist">Grace</a>, but near the end, when Leo <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">has an affair during his Doctors Without Borders mission</span>, she ends up saying no to the possibility that they may be able to work through it. While it was a pretty stupid thing he did, he was at least willing to try and fix things.
<ul><li> Grace's paranoia about Leo having an affair with his pretty coworker turned out to be <em>true</em>, however, this doesn't make her any more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloserToEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloserToEarth">Closer to Earth</a> woman. In fact, it just makes her neurotic.
</li></ul></li><li> Almost every relationship on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow">That '70s Show</a></em> is like this to a degree. Eric and Donna are the most obvious, while Kelso and Jackie are more a case of '"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LysistrataGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LysistrataGambit">Do what I say and I'll sleep with you</a>," as are Fez and Nina. Red and Kitty are a slight subversion, as she is shown to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pollyanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pollyanna">far too idealistic</a> and more easily misguided than the more cynical Red; not to mention a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyDrunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyDrunk">Lady Drunk</a>. Bob and Midge are something of an aversion, as they're both shown to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">equally</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">nuts</a>.
<ul><li> Sometimes Eric is the more practical one, telling Donna that she should just tell him when she wants him to do or not do something rather than "hinting" (Translation: Lying) and saying that everything is okay. He calls her out on this several times but always seems to acknowledge the pointlessness of his actions. As time goes on though their relationship is on more equal footing.
</li><li> It was occasionally suggested that Mrs. Foreman was sometimes faking it to fulfill her social role. "You're making it really hard to pretend I don't know what you're talking about."
</li><li> Red and Kitty are almost an inversion, but they are at any rate far more down to earth than the rest of the cast. Hyde is definitely the most mature of the main group, although Donna might be considered more down to earth. I'm not sure this trope really applies, although it would if we only considered Eric/Donna and Kelso/Jackie, and the later instance only because Kelso makes anyone look competent in comparison.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SugarRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SugarRush">Sugar Rush</a></em>. The father is well-meaning but weak-willed and somewhat in denial about the family's dysfunction, while the mother is a self-indulgent, irresponsible adulteress.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PushingDaisies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PushingDaisies">Pushing Daisies</a></em> where both of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a> are extremely nice albeit flawed people - Chuck (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyishName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyishName">the woman</a>, in case you didn't know) is a lot friendlier and eager to help people, but she can be a little self-centered, reckless and even vengeful in a way that Ned is not.
</li><li> Inverted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleHouseOnThePrairie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleHouseOnThePrairie">Little House on the Prairie</a></em> with the Olesons. Nels is an level-headed man who always does the right thing, but Harriet is petty and greedy.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice">Burn Notice</a></em>, where Fiona is the most aggressive and violent of the trio.
<ul><li> This is how <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Anson</span> ends up getting his hands on Michael and forcing his cooperation. He deliberately orchestrates events to cause Fiona to forget talking and go with her usual "blow it up" method. This provides <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Anson</span> evidence that he holds over Michael's head, threatening to give it to the police.
</li></ul></li><li> The first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> featuring Jack McCoy raises this trope; McCoy and Claire Kincaid are going after a female doctor who has been selling an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllNaturalSnakeOil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllNaturalSnakeOil">All-Natural Snake Oil</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiceRackPanacea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiceRackPanacea">Spice Rack Panacea</a> as a breast cancer cure, with the result that a woman has died. Claire expresses reluctance to pursue the matter criminally, arguing that the doctor is still engaging in research to cure breast cancer. McCoy argues that the doctor's still conning her patients by trying to sell them what she doesn't have and putting their lives in risk, and then bluntly accuses Claire of subscribing to this trope, suggesting that if the doctor had been a man Claire would be the first and most eager person calling for the criminal case. The rest of the episode also touches on this in that the doctor is very contemptuous of male-dominated medical practices which treat the women with patronising dismissiveness; McCoy notes, however, that while this may be the case the male-dominated medical practices are at least keeping women alive, which is more than she's doing.
</li><li> Given an interesting twist in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em> in that it's Richard's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears">daughter Alexis</a> that's the most grounded one of the three generations living together, while Castle himself is a bedrock of common sense and maturity compared to his ex-wife and mother.
<ul><li> Initially at least, the dynamic between Beckett and Castle played this fairly straight — Beckett was the sober, sensible, down-to-earth cop where Castle was the irresponsible, feckless playboy. In later seasons, however, there's been more of a balancing (or even an inversion at times); as Beckett's become increasingly obsessed with solving her mother's murder above all else, behaving increasingly reckless, irrational and at times self-centred, Castle's become more of a voice of reason and willing to call her out whenever he thinks she's overstepped the line.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight and to extremes in the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheOuterLimits1995S4E17Lithia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheOuterLimits1995S4E17Lithia">Lithia</a>" episode from<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOuterLimits1995" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOuterLimits1995">The Outer Limits (1995)</a></em>. A male soldier awakens in the near future from cryogenic hibernation to find that men have been completely wiped out by war and that only women remain, creating an Amazonian society. The women live in relative peace and harmony with each other, but the male soldier proceeds to make trouble, including getting several women killed while trying to steal items from other villages. It turns out that every male that they have unthawed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ARealManIsAKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ARealManIsAKiller">has caused similar problems for the villagers</a>, and that the women no longer trust the male sex, meaning Mercer will be returned to cryostasis. The episode ends with an equally ham-fisted moral from the narrator: <em>"The differences between men and women have been debated among philosophers since recorded history began. If indeed males are by their nature the aggressor, it is this quality that may one day be their undoing."</em> Apparently the problems that arose had nothing to do with him being a trained, futuristic soldier several decades out of place in a communist, extremely primitive village. Nope, it's all about his gonads!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>:
<ul><li> We only saw Buffy's father a handful of times in the early seasons, but what little we did see of him indicated he was a genuinely caring, loving father to Buffy whose marriage to Joyce simply broke down, apparently not entirely the fault of either party. In later seasons, this appeared to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">retconned</a> to make her father a heartless bastard who ran off with his secretary to Spain and didn't care about his daughters or even about the fact that his ex-wife was dying, apparently solely because of this trope.
</li><li> Some of the relationships with male characters seem to reverse this. Xander was definitely more practical than Cordelia when they were dating, though it didn't really come up. He was also usually the sane one with Anya; this was irrelevant other than for her role as comic relief. (For example, unlike him, she had no visible need for a job, residence, or means of support for over a year - until she started <em>acquiring</em> them.) Oz was borderline more "together" than Willow at first, and Jenny Calendar was attracted to Giles as somebody firmly rooted. Still, when everybody gets their doses of trauma, the female characters tend to <em>develop</em> along the lines of this trope, while males are more prone to break down, often in directions which induce more pain for the females. This seems to be especially true for the most minor characters.
</li><li> The characters most frequently portrayed as wise and centered — and possibly the only main characters who didn't implode fearsomely at least once — are Giles and Tara.
</li></ul></li><li> On the subject of Whedon, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em> has Zoe as being more focused and responsible than her husband or even, at times, than Mal. Subverted in the case of Simon, who's a pretty reasonable and intelligent guy (unless it comes to girls, although Kaylee herself isn't much more reasonable on that level).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FawltyTowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FawltyTowers">Fawlty Towers</a></em>, Basil and Sybil Fawlty operate on a level like this; they are both rather horrible and dysfunctional people, but Sybil has better social skills and is calmer in a crisis, whereas Basil is hopelessly lacking in both areas.
</li><li> Granted, all of the correspondents on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDailyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDailyShow">The Daily Show</a></em> tend toward a certain degree of idiocy, but this dynamic can be pretty clearly seen during a lot of segments that deal with Samantha Bee's and Jason Jones's relationship (who are married in real life, as well).
<ul><li> One episode dealt with the Secret Service prostitute scandal with Samantha Bee claiming that this is because there are no women in the Secret Service who have a "civilizing" effect on men. Bee's speech is interrupted by fellow correspondent Jessica Williams who wants Samantha to get back to partying (apparenly, both of them got pretty hammered and had some fun times the night before), completely subverting the speech.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoyMeetsWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoyMeetsWorld">Boy Meets World</a></em> runs on this, going so far as to make an entire episode centered around the theory (ironically brought up by Eric) that "all men since the beginning of time have been idiots." In a special case, Cory and Topanga, the show's main couple, at first subverts it, then <em>mercilessly</em> plays it straight in the later seasons.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment">Arrested Development</a></em>. Though Michael expects Lindsey to be more grounded in reality than the rest of the family, most of the time she's just as bad. She does tend to see the error of her ways more often than the others, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">not that she learns from her mistakes</a>.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUK">Being Human</a></em>. Annie is somewhat ditzy, inclined towards crazy (if well-meaning) schemes, from which she often has to be talked down. Nina also tends to be more emotionally erratic than George, who's generally the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> in the setting (though they both act as the other's moral compass on occasion, George tends to be more honest about it.) Played straight-er with Mitchell, who starts losing control of his life as of the end of season one and never really quite gets it back.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica</a></em> with Starbuck and Apollo: She's the reckless loose cannon who prefers to shoot first and ask questions later, while he's the thoughtful moral compass and voice of reason who often has to reel her back in.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl">My Name Is Earl</a></em>. Both Earl and Darnell are much more sensible than Joy and are on equal footing with Catalina.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PeepShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PeepShow">Peep Show</a></em>. While Mark and Jeremy are both neurotic and incredibly flawed, it's only more noticeable with them because they're the main characters. The female characters are no better.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TeenWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TeenWolf">Teen Wolf</a></em> where the Argent family believes this, but between the two adult siblings Kate and Christopher, he was the wiser and saner while Kate was a complete psychopath, seducing a teenage boy and <em>burning his whole family alive</em> because they were werewolves, without any evidence of wrongdoing. Christopher is this to his wife Victoria as well. The only couple this was played straight with was Lydia and her season 1 and 2 boyfriend Jackson.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnitedStatesOfTara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnitedStatesOfTara">United States of Tara</a></em>. Max is a lot more sensible and sane than Tara. The fact that Tara has about five different personalities living in her undoubtedly helps.
</li><li> Played with on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em>. Daphne appears to be far more sensible than the Crane Brothers but only because much is made of their snobbery. Taken on her own, Daphne shows many signs of eccentricity such as her sunny retellings of childhood traumas or her self-described psychic abilities, making Martin and Roz the sanest of the cast. When she gets together with Niles, both are portrayed as intelligent reasonable people for whom any bizarre behavior is often justified.
<ul><li> Subverted big time however with the boys' earlier wives. While Niles and Frasier can both be extremely neurotic and snobby, both are still shown as good-hearted compassionate individuals. Their wives, however are not. Frasier had Diane, a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolander</a></em> of epic proportions, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Lilith</a>, whom Niles accurately described as the <em>coldest thing in nature</em> (although the show did treat her more sympathetically as it went on). Maris, meanwhile, was absolutely horrible to Niles and threw him out the second he stood up for himself, as well as just being a generally unpleasant woman.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleHowardsBigQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleHowardsBigQuestion">Little Howard's Big Question</a></em>, in which Mother is the main duo's mother figure and provides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Infodump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Infodump">Infodumps</a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Edutainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Edutainment">the subject of the week</a>, thus initially seeming like the down-to-earth sitcom mother to the viewer. However, she is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">prone to moments of complete insanity</a>, like kidnapping and torturing Big Howard's MacBook out of jealousy, and despite being the most book-smart person in the cast she has little common sense and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">almost no grip on reality</a>.
</li><li> Inverted with the Buckets in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KeepingUpAppearances" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KeepingUpAppearances">Keeping Up Appearances</a></em>. Hyacinth is so totally obsessed with her social climbing that she is constantly out of touch with reality—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">insistently</a> pronouncing "Bucket" as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsPronouncedTroPAY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsPronouncedTroPAY">Bouquet</a>" is the least of her issues. Richard, on the other hand, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenpeckedHusband" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenpeckedHusband">long-suffering</a>, but manages to keep his sense of humour—and his sense—despite his insane wife.
</li><li> The sitcom <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Whitney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Whitney">Whitney</a></em> features her boyfriend Alex, who more or less is the straight man to the titular character's antics and commentary.
</li><li> Of the "corner kids" in the fourth season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em>, one of the two girls of the group, Zenobia, is considerably more able to interact normally with people outside of the ghetto than the boys. This is demonstrated most poignantly when they go out to a sit-down restaurant and she is the only one not befuddled by the experience.
<ul><li> Also demonstrated with the McNulty-Beadie relationship, and heavily implied with each of Bunk, Pryzbylewski and Carcetti versus their wives. Greggs too, if she is the "man" of her lesbian relationship.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em>. Elaine <em>thinks</em> she is the moral center of the group and the sane one but she is every bit as uncaring and antisocial as the rest of the group. Out of all the cast, Jerry is the most level-headed and Kramer is only one remotely close to being morally good.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em> vacillates on this with the Lily-Marshall relationship. Marshall is such a massive goofball that Lily often can't help but look closer to earth, merely by default. But part of the reason Marshall loves Lily so much is that she can be every bit as silly and crude as he is. At Marshall's wedding, he revealed that he once held a farting contest with Lily.
<ul><li> One of the reasons they make an entertaining couple is that they're each <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloserToEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloserToEarth">Closer to Earth</a> than the other in different areas (e.g., Lily is brash, impulsive and prone to moronic schemes, Marshall is neurotic, hysterical and has many eccentricities), so both of them get to play the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyGuy">Wacky Guy</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan">Straight Man</a> at different times.
</li><li> On occasion, the Marshall and Lily relationship can invert this trope. Marshall is the most inherently kind and compassionate member of the gang. But every once in a while Lily will display a shallow, selfish, or manipulative streak.
</li><li> It is also averted with Ted and Robin. She is short tempered, irrational and slovenly while he is calm, clear-thinking and organized.

Phil is a goofball and plays the part of the archetypal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">Manchild</a> sitcom husband to the hilt. However, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfairSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfairSex">the wife would normally be portrayed as the calm, mature voice of reason</a>, Claire is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">often played as a control freak</a>; still ultimately sympathetic, but no wiser in the long run than her husband.

Jay gets to be the calm voice of reason far more often than not. In his second marriage, the fact that he's older and has more life experience and that Gloria has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpicyLatina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpicyLatina">spicy Latin temper</a> helps.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation">Parks and Recreation</a></em>:
<ul><li> Played with. The women are more sensible than the men for the most part. Leslie Knope makes virtually all of the decisions (though not all of them are good choices) and is portrayed as the most effective member of the Department. Andy is a complete doofus (season one revolved around his breaking his leg while drunk and retrieving a toaster at the bottom of the pit) compared first with Ann (whom he is heavily dependent on). Tom is educated yet lacking in common sense (he fires a shotgun indiscriminately during a hunting trip) and Jerry is gullible (although most characters, male and female, take advantage of Jerry.)
</li><li> Andy's case becomes slightly more balanced after he gets together with April, who breaks from her usual apathy to become his co-conspirator in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudcuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudcuckooLander">Cloudcuckooland</a>. Being significantly younger than Andy, it occasionally falls on him to be the voice of reason and responsibility... in relative terms, anyway.
</li><li> Inverted occasionally by Ron who tends to be a little more down to earth than Leslie. He warns Leslie it is not her place to prevent Andy and April's wedding and also counsels other members of the Department when Lil' Sebastian goes missing. However Ron still defers to Leslie's decision making in most cases and requires her to intervene whenever his ex-wife Tammy arrives to manipulate him.
</li><li> Generally averted with Leslie and Ben, who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirdsOfAFeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirdsOfAFeather">very much alike</a> and very much equals. There both very qualified at their respective jobs, hard working, and successful. Ben is one of the few people able to hold back Leslie's eccentricities and flaws, but he does have plenty of his own. At the end of the day there is a clear mutual respect and love between them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Bad</a></em> plays this straight in its early episodes given Skyler's overall lack of involvement in her husband's illegal activity. As the story progresses and she becomes both more complicit and increasingly irrational, it is averted. It is also averted with Hank and Marie and Jesse and his girlfriend Jane, who threatens to expose Walt and introduces Jesse to heroin.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren">Married... with Children</a></em>. Al is incredibly bitter and immoral but Peggy is even worse with her refusal to take care of her children, her mistreatment of Al and her constant mooching. Al comes across as a <em>Jerkass Woobie</em> while she is just a <em>Jerkass</em>.
<ul><li> Also while Al is not portrayed as particularly intelligent Peg's schemes do come across as downright surreal, like when she sold beauty products but it turned out she was only turning a profit because she was buying her own products. Al actually had to sit her down and explain that she was actually spending money not making it.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted and given a twist on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock">30 Rock</a></em>. Liz is often the only sane one among her staff, mostly Tracy but Jenna is often just as bad as him if not worse. When Liz goes off the handle, Pete and Jack are the sane ones. Tracy will be given sane moments, although usually with a twist. Let's just say no one is spared a dose of craziness now and then.
</li><li> Played for laughs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em>; Britta Perry often likes to <em>think</em> she's this trope, but she really, really, <em>really</em> isn't. Very explicitly parodied in "Digital Estate Planning". Britta mocks Jeff about how this is the difference between the two sexes- women don't "hack and slash through life." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DescriptionCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DescriptionCut">Cut to</a> Annie and Shirley who are hiding a dead body and preparing to murder the rest of his family to cover their trail. (Note: This was in a video game, so its not <em>quite</em> as horrible as it seems.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em>, while it tries to be balanced, slants in this direction. While Bones herself isn't as much on the common sense scale, she is by far the most intelligent. The women are generally portrayed as wiser, while the men are usually the ones who do childish things like experiments for the purpose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">Stuff Blowing Up</a> and need the supervision of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Team Mom</a> Dr. Saroyan. Booth constantly gets anthropological terms wrong (which could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a>, though) Angela and Sweets both declared "Men are idiots" in a episode. Bones and Angela went out of the way to remind us that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAbusersAreMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAbusersAreMale">all violence towards animals are male.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Coupling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Coupling">Coupling</a></em> has neurotic, self-centred crazy people aplenty of both sexes, but Steve and Susan — the main couple, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan">Straight Men</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatars</a> — have this dynamic. Steve tends to be an indecisive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">Manchild</a> while Susan's the responsible adult.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em>, very strongly. There's three types of character on the show: The stereotypical antisocial losers (always male), the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">Jerk Jock</a>-type characters (also always male), and the girly girl who all the guys want to get with.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MalcolmInTheMiddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MalcolmInTheMiddle">Malcolm in the Middle</a></em>. While Lois <em>is</em> unarguably the head of the family and certainly more competent and savvy about parenting and keeping house than Hal, it is due to necessity and long practice with honing her skills to keep her children under control, not wisdom. While Hal is most definitely a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad">Bumbling Dad</a>, Lois is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplarParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplarParent">Knight Templar Parent</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">Hair-Trigger Temper</a>, and is usually loud, irrational, pig-headed, and tactless and needs Hal to talk her down as frequently as he needs her to talk him down from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme">Zany Schemes</a> and emotional meltdowns. The lack of a "normal" parent is part of what makes the show's rather extreme portrayal of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionalFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionalFamily">Dysfunctional Family</a> so much easier to swallow than it would be if one half of the main couple was sane.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnlyFoolsAndHorses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnlyFoolsAndHorses">Only Fools and Horses</a></em>: Raquel to the extent where she's the only consistently sane character from around "Rodney Come Home" onwards.
<ul><li> Cassandra, to much less of an extent than Raquel, though. She's definitely the more sensible one out of her and Rodney, but Rodney is himself generally more sensible compared to Del Boy, and Cassandra is both insanely career driven and prone to acting like a spoiled brat at times.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>. Played incredibly straight during a Klingon marriage ceremony. The Gods created the first Klingon heart, but it was lonely. They created a female heart that beat stronger, but the male heart was jealous of its power and fought it. "Fortunately the second heart was tempered by wisdom. '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">If we join together, no force can stop us</a>'." The two hearts joined become so powerful they overthrow the Gods.
</li><li> Habib, and to a lesser extent Patricia, are more sensible and less often the butt of jokes than the male characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheThinBlueLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheThinBlueLine">The Thin Blue Line</a></em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Elementary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Elementary">Elementary</a></em>, although for the most part their partnership is equal, when it comes to social matters and etiquette, it's overwhelmingly Watson that has to keep Sherlock in line.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyTree">Family Tree</a></em>: In her first scene of the series, Bea is giving sensible advice to her loser brother Tom. Only in the next scene is it revealed that she carries around and frequently speaks through a ventriloquist's puppet.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheThundermans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheThundermans">The Thundermans</a></em> depicts super-powered twins (brother and sister). One twin is a straight-A student, involved in academic clubs and volunteer work, a goody-two-shoes who is generally nice to everybody, and well on the way to becoming a great superhero. The other twin is a slacker in school, an unrepentant and sometimes cruel prankster, generally rude and ill-mannered, and an aspiring supervillain. Guess which twin is female.
<ul><li> Granted it is also played with on occasion as Max (male twin) is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">Brilliant, but Lazy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius">Evil Genius</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a>.

Female characters are often <em>more</em> violent, obsessive, neurotic, overcompetitive and perverted than the males.
<ul><li> Moze, the main female character of the show, assaulted her friends in throughout the series run, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">suspected three girls of being robots</a> and had introspective conversations with inanimate objects.
</li><li> Evelyn Kwon entered an academic competition and lost; her response was to scream and slam desks as she stormed out the room.
</li><li> The Huge Crew are a group of three girls who kiss a dirty bathroom stall and start a school club over a boy they like.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight with Chilindrina in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ElChavoDelOcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ElChavoDelOcho">El Chavo del ocho</a></em>, she´s clearly more intelligent than the other two kids Chavo and Kiko, by far. Popis on the other hand is almost as dumb as them both, but Popis is a recurrent character. Also played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ElChapulinColorado" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ElChapulinColorado">El Chapulín Colorado</a></em>, the woman in the episode (normally played by Florinda Meza) is always more intelligent than her husband (normally played by Carlos Villagrán) and Chapulín himself. Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chespirito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chespirito">Chespirito</a></em> with <em>Los Caquitos</em>, Botija is by far much more intelligent and cultured than Chimoltrufia.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted">Subverted</a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrooklynNineNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrooklynNineNine">Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a></em>. Of the female characters, Det. Amy Santiago initially <em>seems</em> like one of the most mature characters in the cast, particularly compared to her partner / love interest Det. Jake Peralta, but when you look closer she's actually just as immature, competitive, socially awkward and childish as he is — just from a different direction (whereas he's the class clown who never grew up, she acts like she's constantly striving to be high school valedictorian), thus leading her to get into just as much trouble. Det. Rosa Diaz also seems like she's got a good head on her shoulders, but this is contrasted with a <em>very</em> short temper and tendency towards violent solutions to problems, which also doesn't always help. And as for Gina Linetti, she's a raging <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narcissist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narcissist">Narcissist</a> who barely cares about other people at all. The most sane, stable and common-sense character in the cast is arguably the male Sgt. Terry Jeffords.

Nokama filled in pretty much the same role in her team, which is understandable, given her original occupation as a teacher. Later on this trope got deliberately avoided, at times inverted, with the exception of one occasion: characters belonging to the element of Psionics were stated to have been created as female because the first member of their race was an overly brash male who caused great trouble — although the questionable sensibilities of this origin story were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">mocked by the other characters</a>, including another female Toa.

From the comic's beginning, these two friends were both described as being mischievous pranksters, though Jason was the calmer and more rational one, while Aubrey was driven by whim and often abandoned hers halfway through. Both have undergone character development since then, but Aubrey's has been greater, arguably making her slightly more level-headed. (They're also married now, incidentally.)
<ul><li> They're just about even now, really. While both are mischievous, Jason's pranks were always much more thought out, with backup plans in place should anything go wrong.

Zach has a successful business and wants to be in a respectful, adult relationship leading to marriage. Hazel not so much.

Liln is significantly less crazy than most of the male characters, but still noticeably crazier than her boyfriend Jame. First Folio, on the other hand, is just as eccentric as everyone else.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Marge and Homer Simpson take this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">to the point of parody</a>. Homer is the archetypical dimwitted sitcom husband who nearly always needs to learn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">a moral lesson</a> in any given episode, which he is almost certain to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">forget</a> by the next. Marge, on the other hand, is <em>so</em> down-to-earth that she is incredibly boring.
</li><li> Bart and Lisa Simpson do this too, albeit to a much lesser extent than their parents — Lisa is certainly much more intelligent than Bart, but Bart is the more socially adept of the two and isn't nearly as dumb as his father.
</li><li> The trope gets taken to its logical extreme in the episode "Lisa The Simpson," where Lisa discovers that even though all Simpsons <em>start out</em> intelligent, only the men have a genetic condition that causes them to gradually lose their intelligence as they age, ending up as bumbling, idiotic man-children working menial jobs, while the women keep their intelligence into adulthood and thus are all very successful.
</li></ul></li><li> Lois and Peter Griffin in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>. This is somewhat subverted in that Lois is far from perfect herself, often giving into temptations such as theft and lust. While she always outshines Peter, she is often outshone by their intellectual and compassionate dog, Brian. Of course, even Brian has a number of character flaws like alcoholism and angry outbursts. For the first season at least, though, it was played completely straight. Peter is always the jerk or the idiot, and if Lois ever loses her patience, it's only due to having been driven to the point where even Mother Theresa would lose it. She and Meg only develop real comic character flaws in later seasons (though given its evolution into more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistShow">sadistic humor</a> they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">take said flaws to extremes</a>).
</li><li> Totally inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em>. Hank is down-to-earth and grounded (even to the point of being a wet blanket). Peggy is crazy and out there. She perceives the situation... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">differently</a>. Luanne is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde">Dumb Blonde</a>.

While Wanda usually serves as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> who advises Timmy against stupid wishes, Cosmo tends to openly encourage them.
<ul><li> To a lesser extent, Timmy's parents. Sure, they're both nuts, but his dad's considerably <em>more</em> nuts.
</li><li> Inverted with Anti-Cosmo and Anti-Wanda. Anti-Cosmo is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius">Evil Genius</a>, while Anti-Wanda is a dim-witted redneck who eats with her feet.
</li></ul></li><li> Muriel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CourageTheCowardlyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CourageTheCowardlyDog">Courage the Cowardly Dog</a></em> plays with this trope. While she's definitely much wiser than her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> husband Eustace, given how Eustace often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">ends up on the receiving end of great danger due to his stupidity and stubbornness</a>, Muriel's intelligence often varies depending on the events she goes through. In some episodes, she is very aware of the danger she and the other two main characters come across. In others, she usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter">trusts some of the villains despite how clearly ominous they appear</a>.
</li><li> Elise in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanVs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanVs">Dan Vs.</a></em>, while having her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll">Not So Above It All</a> moments, is usually much more rational and level-headed than both her husband and his psychopathic friend. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">This gets exaggerated big time in the second season</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">especially when most of the episodes in the second season have Elise stealing the spotlight from the main character</a>, and the ones in which she isn't the focus on, she often saves Dan and Chris through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether">Drawn Together</a></em> is an odd case, both Toot and Clara are often portrayed as just as bad, if not worse than the males in the house. Foxxy Love, however (although she's certainly no saint) has been described as the only one "not totally retarded" and is generally the most caring, responsible, and motivated person on the show. She's also black, so it's probably another form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PositiveDiscrimination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PositiveDiscrimination">Positive Discrimination</a>.
</li><li> Played straight and subverted with Maddie from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em>. While she definitely plays a better parental figure then Jack, she will be just as obsessed and out-of-focus as her husband if a ghost catches her attention. With a series about ghosts, this happens quite frequently.
<ul><li> Even in that case, she's much more competent and rational in her ghost hunting and tends to avoid seeing ghosts where there are none and overreacting like Jack does.
</li><li> Although it seems that Jack is something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz">Genius Ditz</a> who actually may be smarter than Maddie in some respects. Most of their equipment, although maintained by Maddie, is usually invented by Jack.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyNeutron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyNeutron">Jimmy Neutron</a></em>: Though Jimmy is smarter than both of them, Hugh is definitely the stupid one in the family.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em>. While Stan is no doubt much more out of touch and outright <em>insane</em> than his wife, considering some of the things Francine's tried to do, she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloserToEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloserToEarth">Closer to Earth</a> the same way Mars is "Closer To Earth" than Neptune.
<ul><li> Francine, we must remember, is a woman <em>who abandoned her children for a year</em> just so she could get revenge on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeClooney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeClooney">George Clooney</a> for upstaging her in a bit part she had on a sitcom twenty years earlier. Of course, Stan went along with it, but only to make her happy. Closer to Earth, indeed.
</li><li> This is probably best described as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">Zig-Zagging Trope</a>. Which one of them is closer to Earth is largely dependent on the situation. If it's something involving politics or one of the kids behaving oddly, Stan flies off the handle and Francine is the reasonable one. If it has to do with their marriage or social status, Francine flies off the handle and Stan is the reasonable one. Each one needs the other the keep them sane at different times... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">kind of like a real marriage</a>!
</li><li> In terms of role designation, the trope is still usually played straight, however, due to Stan usually playing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad">Bumbling Dad</a> role and getting the vaster share of Aesops handed to him than Francine. Francine has clear flaws, but they are more often played for quick gags with her usually having to deal with Stan's problems rather than instigate her own (even the odd times she is made to learn a lesson, it usually involves her having to put up with Stan's own stupidity). Steve and Hayley have a similar dynamic.
</li><li> Played in it's fullest throttle in "Hurricane". While Francine and Hayley are full blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionSurvivor">Action Survivors</a>, all of the male Smiths act as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone">The Millstone</a> and make things worse. complete with failed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhovs Guns</a>, the Aesop of the episode even more or less being that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhaleAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhaleAesop">Stan is completely incompetent compared to Francine</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Baloo and Rebecca play a similar (albeit more platonic) example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin">TaleSpin</a></em>. While Rebecca is slightly less impulsive and obnoxious than Baloo, she shares his stubborness and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">ego</a> (and is also a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">Control Freak</a>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> suggests they were intended to foil each other in different aspects. Baloo was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a> and slovenly, but also streetwise and resourceful due to his adventuring. Rebecca was a logical business woman and well educated, but also somewhat naive and inept to the outside world. Generally if depending on the scenario, either could play the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a>, with the other playing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloserToEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloserToEarth">Closer to Earth</a> Straight Man.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTick">The Tick</a></em>: There's American Maid, a completely competent confident superheroine in a cast that includes mostly insane and retarded heroes alongside posturing ineffectual heroes and meek neurotic sidekicks. They also have an exchange with a female superhero team in Belgium, this team is shown to be more powerful and more competent than Arthur and the Tick.
</li><li> Played both ways on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a>:</em> Linda is generally more grounded than Lawrence, and Doofenshmirtz's craziness is contrasted by both his ex-wife and daughter's sanity. However, <em>Candace</em> is absolutely neurotic, making her far less down-to-earth than either of her brothers or her love interest Jeremy. These cases are murky, though; Candace (and Lawrence to a lesser extent) <em>seem</em> kookier, but then, they're the ones who know what's <em>really</em> going on, so...
<ul><li> In fact, the few times that Linda catches a glimpse of <em>just</em> how strange her life really is, she becomes almost as neurotic as Candace.
</li></ul></li><li> Noodle from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gorillaz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gorillaz">Gorillaz</a> has been the most mentally stable and well-adjusted member of the group so far. Strangely, she remained so even after she regained her memory inbetween Phases 1 and 2, learning that she was trained as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> for the Japanese government and the only alive kid left from the project.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Tiny Toon Adventures</a></em>, where Buster was far less flighty and impulsive than Babs.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone">The Dreamstone</a></em>, Amberley seems slightly more competant and well adjusted than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KindheartedSimpleton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KindheartedSimpleton">Rufus</a>, but also somewhat more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint">boisterous and moody</a> compared to other peers. Similarly played with Wildit, who is one of the most experienced and skilled Wuts alongside being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheSillyOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheSillyOnes">one of the dizziest</a>.
</li><li> Given a twist in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>. While Leela is certainly the most sensible of the crew, Fry is undoubtedly the kindest most moral character on the show. Further more, while Leela is much more intelligent and mature than Fry, she is often shown as stubborn and short tempered to contrast Fry's mellowness.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLooneyTunesShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLooneyTunesShow">The Looney Tunes Show</a></em> plays it straight with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Daffy</a> and Tina, but completely inverts it with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Bugs</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Lola</a>.
</li><li> Kanga of Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheManyAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheManyAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh">Winnie the Pooh</a></em> adaptations. While even the sanest males such as Rabbit and Eeyore have frequent moments of naivete and brainlessness, Kanga usually holds the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityBall">Sanity Ball</a> and acts as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Team Mom</a> to the other animals outside of unindividual acts of bumbling by the entire cast (a possible reason she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> due to most stories focusing on misunderstandings and blundering). The original novels' Kanga was also slightly saner, but a bit more idiot prone.
</li><li> The parents in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em> show evidence of this. With Stu and Didi, Didi is the rational one and the disciplinarian, and of Betty and Howard, Betty is the stronger one and more decisive. This also seems to be the case with Randy and Lucy. However, it's subverted with Chaz and Kira who are both competent parents, although Chaz does slip into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad">Bumbling Dad</a> territory. Completely averted with Drew and Charlotte, who are both awful parents, as Angelica demonstrates.
<ul><li> Played with for Stu and Didi; Stu is more eccentric and childish, but far more laid back than neurotic, overly cautious Didi. Howard is similarly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NervousWreck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NervousWreck">Nervous Wreck</a>, but less abrasive than Betty.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> plays this straight with the Marsh family (Sharon is often exasperated by the idiotic things Randy does), inverts it with the Broflovski family (Gerald is relatively sane, while Sheila is a nutjob) and averts it with the McCormick family (Stuart and Carol spend too much of their time fighting for one to clearly be depicted as being any smarter than the other).
<ul><li> Even the Broflovskis zigzag with it since Gerald is also an occasionally immoral lawyer. Similarly, Sharon is only sane compared to Randy, and pretty much <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless">all adults</a></em>, male or female, revert to moronic panic whenever something plagues the town (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">be it warranted or not</a>). Stan and Wendy also flip flop with this, both are prone to acts of childishness and self-righteousness as they alternate acting as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a>.
</li><li> Generally speaking, as collectives, the girls are more productive, more resilient, better organized and stronger-willed than the boys, and the men cause more trouble than the women.
</li><li> This is deconstructed in Season 23's "Turd Burglars", where the A-Plot of the episode is titled "One for the Ladies". In this episode, the women of South Park are given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Day in the Limelight</a>, and it's clearly shown that the women are just as disgusting, horrible, backstabbing, and idiotic as the men are. To top it all off, all the trouble the women cause is shown to be much more dangerous than all the troubles the men have caused, as the women end up getting infected with C-Diff and contaminate more than half of South Park to the point where they would've died if it weren't for the boys finding a cure for the outbreak their mothers caused.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em> fans have noted that the female characters are almost always more dominant (and developed) than the males. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith">Played With</a>, however, because being well-developed also often means they have more noticeable flaws.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM">Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM)</a></em>: While Sally had palpable flaws such as overcautiousness and a haughty temper, they came at the expense of her competence a lot less often than Sonic's, and a lot of the time, Sally had to keep Sonic in check when his overconfidence or reckless attitude <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">lands him in trouble</a>. Bunnie and Dulcy were somewhat ditzier, but still made far less detrimental mistakes than him or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawLoser">Antoine</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom">Sonic Boom</a></em>, on the other hand, is willing to play with gender dynamics for laughs on a case-by-case basis. The episode "Into the Wilderness" does show Amy and Sticks being wiser than Sonic and Knuckles in regards to wilderness survival, but when you consider that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildChild">Sticks</a> is the group's expert on the subject and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Amy</a> was more willing to learn than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeEgo">Sonic</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">it makes complete sense</a>.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan">The Spectacular Spider Man</a></em>. Of the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeAmigos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeAmigos">¡Three Amigos!</a>, it is Gwen Stacy who is the most observant and concerned for Harry.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop">Goof Troop</a></em> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetenceZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetenceZone">Competence Zone</a> that drastically favors 11-year-olds... when it comes to the guys. Peg, the only adult woman in the cast, is also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Woman</a> a lot of the time, and actually has <em>more</em> sense than Pete (which of her and PJ has more primarily depends on who is in focus). Completely averted with the Petes' kids, though, with PJ being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> whenever Peg isn't and Pistol being totally hyperactive—it should be noted, however, that PJ is both in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetenceZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetenceZone">Competence Zone</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTouchWithHisFeminineSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTouchWithHisFeminineSide">In Touch with His Feminine Side</a>, while Pistol is extremely young.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Spliced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Spliced">Spliced</a></em> plays this completely straight, both with Patricia (in relation to Peri, Joe, and Entree) and Octocat (in relation to Smarty Smarts).
</li><li> Pick a princess from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>, any princess at all, and compare her to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleRich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleRich">Prince</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit">Blueblood</a>.

Due to this being a series primarily made for girls, most of the wise and competent roles are filled by females who get the lion's share of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, while males are often limited to supporting characters or antagonists tend to be either evil or immature.
<ul><li> There are inversions, however. Spike frequently plays the role of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan">Straight Man</a> to whenever Twilight (and sometimes the entire Mane six) starts to get a little anxious and crazy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">The Stoic</a> Big Mac also acts as the most sensible member of his all-female part of the Apple family. Furthermore, Celestia may take the cake in being the wisest character on the show, but the flashback in the "Reflections" arc in the comic series has the younger Celestia ignoring the male Star Swirl's warnings to not utilize a portal to travel to another dimension.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> has Jinx, both the only girl in the H.I.V.E. Five and the only one who strives to be anything more than a common street villain the Titans beat on a weekly basis (more specifically, to join the Brotherhood of Evil). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She's also the only one to take a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighHeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighHeelFaceTurn">High Heel</a> variety.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted">Subverted</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed">deconstructed</a> by Beth and Jerry in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em>. Jerry is constantly shown as being idiotic, self-defeating, and inadequate, and he allows Beth to put him down because she tolerates his many failings. That certainly looks like this dynamic at first, but it slowly becomes apparent that Beth tolerates their codependent relationship because she is in many ways just as broken as Jerry, getting a perverse schadenfreude-laden pleasure out of seeing him fail so that she can continue feeling superior and knowing that, pathetic as he is, he'll never leave her the way her father did no matter how badly she treats him. Ultimately, Beth is almost certainly more intelligent and competent than Jerry, but <em>wiser</em>? Nuh-uh.
</li><li> In the American <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em> series, the producers tried to compensate for Smurfette being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple">the only female Smurf</a> by making her smarter than most of the population to the point where she is almost the Second in Command of the village.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball">The Amazing World of Gumball</a></em>, the male and female characters outside of the Gumball home each have their personality quirks based on what kind of creature they are, but within the household Gumball's mother and sister are one of the smartest characters in the show and their father by far the dumbest and laziest guy in town who once even had a competition to see who's the laziest with the man who's now the town's hardest worker but who used to go by the name of "Lazy Larry". His father's brain literally barely functions at all as a result of bad, overprotective parenting from his mother, and his foolishness has led to complete destruction of Elmore as well as financial ruin for the Wattersons many times, but the family still loves him nevertheless. His sister is even found to have a genius IQ. Of course, everyone in the family has a breaking point, like in the episode where the family's fight over the TV remote takes them all over town and in another episode where they just can't find anywhere to park their car no matter how hard they try. Gumball and Darwin are both equally stupid, but Darwin seems to have more common sense when it comes to Darwin's hair-brained schemes.
<ul><li> In "The Goons" a dumb race was hosted with the dumbest people on Elmore, at least in Gumball's opinion, and all participants were male (they could have used [[Cloudcuckoolander Sussie]] the chinikin puppet girl, but she would be too hard to animate especially in a season 1 episode, so she was probably replaced by Rocky who is a regular puppet)
</li></ul></li><li> Wonderfully averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaveTheBarbarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaveTheBarbarian">Dave the Barbarian</a></em> with the two female protagonists. Candy is a shallow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValleyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValleyGirl">Valley Girl</a> who cares more about go shopping than doing her royal duties, while Fang is a violent tomboy whose main interest is basically smashing things up. There is also the (female) magic sword Lula, who is rude and abrasive to everyone. In fact, the voice of reason is, usually, their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneptMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneptMage">Inept Mage</a> uncle Oswidge.
</li><li> Another aversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy">The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy</a></em>. Mandy is way smarter than Billy (not that that's a very high bar, anyway) but is also amoral, mean and manipulative. In fact, the closest the show has to a morally-adjusted character is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">Grim</a>.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Chowder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Chowder">Chowder</a></em> with Truffles, who is short-tempered, obnoxious to everyone and, especially, loud, while her husband, Mung Daal, is calmer and more level-headed.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobsBurgers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobsBurgers">Bob's Burgers</a></em> with Bob and Linda. Both of them get carried away from time to time, but the frequency and degree differs. Bob plays the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan">Straight Man</a> more often than not, but when it's his turn to be irrational, he does it big. In contrast, Linda's flights of fancy are more frequent, but they tend to be pretty benign more often than not. Fortunately, when push comes to shove, they've got each other's backs.
</li><li> Averted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MoralOrel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MoralOrel">Moral Orel</a></em>. Bloberta Puppington's abuse is more subtle than her husband's, but, in her own way, she's just as horrible a parent, Christian, and human being in general as Clay.
</li><li> Played with on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes">Jimmy Two-Shoes</a></em>. Heloise, the token girl, is far and away the smartest character on the show and is the one who really keeps Miseryville running in the face of the incompetence of her male coworkers. However, she's also a deranged, sadistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible">Enfant Terrible</a> who mainly uses her skills to make the rest of the population miserable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>, while Jimmy is the show's moral centre.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo">Ready Jet Go!</a></em> <em>loves</em> this trope. The girls in the show, such as Sydney, Mindy, Celery, and Dr. Rafferty, are much more intelligent, competent, and level-headed compared to their male counteparts Jet, Sean, Carrot, and Dr. Bergs, all of which end up as the butt of jokes most of the time.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MackAndMoxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MackAndMoxy">Mack &amp; Moxy</a></em>, the female raccoon Moxy is portrayed as being more competent than Mack, who suffers from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">downplayed</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MooseAreIdiots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MooseAreIdiots">Moose Are Idiots</a> characterization.
</li><li> A possible species-wide example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLifeAndTimesOfJuniperLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLifeAndTimesOfJuniperLee">The Life and Times of Juniper Lee</a></em> in the case of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigfootSasquatchAndYeti" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigfootSasquatchAndYeti">Bigfoot, Sasquatch and Yeti</a> that the main characters meet; the males are barely functioning idiots with short-term memory problems (their chief forgets he's the chief several times in a single conversation). The only Sasquatch with any common sense and useful skills is Lila, the only confirmed female we see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetenceZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetenceZone">and roughly June's age to boot</a>. She joins June at the end of the episode to try out the "normal kid" side of things, including attending the main characters' elementary school.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017">DuckTales (2017)</a></em>:
<ul><li> Zan Owlson is the only female CEO seen in the series, and she manages to be a lot more moral and competent than most of the male CEOs (which is especially noticeable with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsPetty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsPetty">Glomgold</a>, who she ends up interacting with the most). She even manages to come off as this to Scrooge, to an extent; both are highly competent, but unlike Scrooge, she's far less likely to give in to a petty grudge.
</li><li> Of all the major members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery">Rogues Gallery</a>, Ma Beagle is both one of the only females (there's also Magica and Goldie, but they have their own issues) <em>and</em> quite possibly the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">sanest</a> of them all. All of her children are male and dumber than she is.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife">Rocko's Modern Life</a></em>, Bev Bighead is far less hostile than Ed Bighead. While the latter is shown in one episode to have arranged a team of scientists devoted to killing Rocko and his friends, Bev has no animosity towards him.
</li><li> "Wiser" is always relative in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction">Dysfunction Junction</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BoJackHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BoJackHorseman">BoJack Horseman</a></em>, but of its five main characters, the women tend to be more sensible and are often tasked with wrangling whichever characters are in their orbit. Compare the ambitious, organized, and prone-to-pep-talking agent/manager Princess Carolyn and the nerdy and socially aware writer Diane to the self-destructive and messy BoJack, the lazy slacker Todd, and the blissfully oblivious Mr. Peanutbutter.
