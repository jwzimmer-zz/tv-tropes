Nevertheless, the existence of this trope can mean that the antagonist had a motivation or goal simple enough to be mistaken for the behavior of a mere animal, so that many of its scenes could be acted by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMaliciousMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMaliciousMonster">Non-Malicious Monster</a> without much difference.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BakuganBattleBrawlers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BakuganBattleBrawlers">Bakugan Battle Brawlers</a></em>, the Bakugan (actually aliens from another world turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardGames">Card Game</a>) are sentient beings who had their self-awareness suppressed due to negative energy. When they regain their sanity, the forces of darkness try to crush them... In the <em>New Vestroia</em> season, there is a <em>government conspiracy</em> lead by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">King of the Vestals</a> to keep the fact that Bakugan are self-aware a secret from the rest of the population.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>: Typically, Saiyans are reduced to mindless, destructive animals when they become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManiacMonkeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManiacMonkeys">Great</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfTheFiftyFootWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfTheFiftyFootWhatever">Apes</a>. When Vegeta becomes one during his fight with Goku in the Saiyan Saga, however, he retains all of his higher reasoning and intelligence, and can even <em>speak</em>. It isn't clear why this is the case; theories range from Goku's brain-damage and Gohan's half-breed nature interfering with the transformation, to Vegeta simply having been properly trained growing up in how to use the Great Ape transformation.
<ul><li> Kid Buu, the most primal of the forms of Majin Buu displays a degree of cunning you wouldn't expect. While he's incapable of speech like Fat and Super Buu and only hollers like a wild animal he is a lot smarter than you'd think. If his arm gets cut off he can use the appendage to attack an opponent when they least expect it, if he is hit by a barrage of blasts and pinned down, he'll break his body apart and reform himself elsewhere. And as shown when he fought The South Supreme Kai, if an enemy manages to be strong enough to actually defeat him, he'll absorb him into his body.
</li></ul></li><li> The ELS in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gundam00AwakeningOfTheTrailblazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gundam00AwakeningOfTheTrailblazer">Gundam 00 Awakening Of The Trailblazer</a></em> are at first somewhat single-minded and simplistic in action, and some of the characters in the series remain unconvinced that they are truly sentient until, near the end, the ELS are observed adapting their tactics and countering the humans' strategies in battle. One character even exclaims "They're learning!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens">Vajra</a> encountered in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier">Macross Frontier</a></em> come off as a bit of a scientific dilemma: they're spacefaring critters with apparently eusocial behavior that can overpower starships, but they themselves have little centralization in their nervous systems (i.e. "no brains"). At first it isn't clear if they even communicate with each other. Only later, when they started using complex military tactics and began reacting to Ranka's and Sheryl's singing, was it made clear that they have some sort of guiding intellect. In the end, it was obvious: the Vajra aren't individuals per-se, they're more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">individual cells</a>. The "Vajra" organism is, in fact, <em>the entire species</em>, spread throughout the Galaxy, and communicating with itself via cellular-level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubspaceAnsible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubspaceAnsible">Subspace Ansibles</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhale">Space Whales</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7">Macross Dynamite 7</a></em> are initially thought to just be animals. Very big, very powerful animals, but nonetheless just animals. The poachers trying to kill them are the first to notice that the Whales can identify who is a threat and choose their targets according (they do not harm the good guys, who are trying to protect them), while everyone else seems to realize they're smarter than they look when Basara sings to them and they start singing back.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em>: In the <em>Mazinger-Z vs Great General of Darkness</em>, when Kouji faces <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger">Mykene's</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast">War Beasts</a> for first time, he -accostumed to the mindless, silent drones that Dr. Hell used- gets utterly shocked when they begin talking to him. Quickly learns that that is not the only difference with the Mechanical Beasts. They are intelligent, capable to think on their own, devise complex strategies, fight coordinatedly and even lay traps. Oh, and they are pretty cunning, too (they dragged and dunked Mazinger in the ocean, knowing that his robot's mobility is crap underwater, unlike the aquatic Beast that was waiting for him).
<div class="indent"><strong>Kouji</strong>: It talks!
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>, several unique Titans show signs of having intelligence, in contrast to most that are little more than mindless animals. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This makes sense, since they are actually people capable of transforming into a Titan form and therefore maintain their human intelligence.</span>
<ul><li> During the battle of Trost, Eren realizes that the Colossal Titan is moving strategically by kicking the door in (to let the smaller Titans in) and then smashing the defensive cannons on the wall (to decrease resistance).
</li><li> The Rogue Titan, which kills other Titans instead of humans, puts up its fists in a boxer's stance and knows to crush the nape of a foe's neck to kill it for good. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Rogue Titan is Eren</span>.
</li><li> Armin realizes that the Female Titan is trying to capture a certain member of the Survey Corps, after it lifts up his hood to examine his face instead of killing him straight away.
</li><li> Hange realized that some Titans must be intelligent after discovering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypticLog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypticLog">a notebook left behind by a dead soldier</a> in which the soldier reported that a Titan tried to talk to her.

While she's scratching at the door trying to get to the students her adult instincts kick in and she tries to hide herself in order to avoid attacking them. She locks herself in the basement but eventually turns full-zombie and ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">heartbreaking</a>. Although it's implied that even when she's fully turned, the fact that she can pull off a <em>very</em> disconcerting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile">Slasher Smile</a> upon attacking the group implies that there is still some form of thinking going on inside her necrotic brain.
</li><li> If you only watched the first few episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> you might be forgiven for thinking the Angels are just brainless gigantic monsters. As the series goes on however, more and more Angels attempt new strategies (usually ones that would let them counter or bypass the Evangelion units), with some even seemingly being capable of communication with humans. This culminates with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Kaworu</a>, an angel who's essentially identical to a human.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews">Akakabuto</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GingaNagareboshiGin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GingaNagareboshiGin">Ginga: Nagareboshi Gin</a></em>, is shown to be a very intelligent bear. He knows how to ambush hunters without giving them a chance to fire at him, or stands at a distance that negates clear shots, uses other bears as territory guards, builds himself a fortress of rocks and can predict certain attacks the dogs attempt towards him. In the manga, he can even talk, though in a language different from the dogs'.
</li><li> Tae in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ZombielandSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ZombielandSaga">Zombieland Saga</a></em> starts out as a typical Romero-style zombie, but over time she learns through imitating her bandmates. By the end of Season One, she's capable of learning synchronized dancing, can follow simple instructions, has tried lying (badly), and is capable of basic problem solving. She's still prone to chewing whatever she can get her hands on, though.
</li><li> The title beasts of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GoblinSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GoblinSlayer">Goblin Slayer</a></em>. Though far from tactical geniuses, Goblins have a surprising deviousness and evil cunning that not many experienced adventures believe, and not many new adventures (Who often take killing them as an easy early quest) are aware of. Complete with traps, poisoned weapons, large <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook">Hobgoblins</a> when things get hairy and so on. Their cunning nature frequently spells doom for new adventures who see them as an easy starting foe. Goblins can also develop into more specialized and intelligent breeds whether through natural development or through being empowered by other beings:
<ul><li> Goblin Shamans are capable of using magic after being temporarily possessed by a minor demon.
</li><li> Goblin Lords are heralded as the kings of the Goblin race. These Goblins are capable of long-term planning and strategy and can organize goblins into an army. They tend not to be slouches in physical combat either.

<ul><li> The unnamed xenomorphs in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Alien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Alien">Alien</a></em> series.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alien">Alien</a></em>: In the novelisation, Ash says they could try communicating with the creature as it may be intelligent. When Ripley asks if Ash was able to do so, Ash replies ambiguously, "Let my grave hold some secrets."
</li><li> The most notable example of this trope in the <em>Alien</em> franchise is the scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens">Aliens</a></em> where the power is cut off moments before the aliens attack. In a later scene, the Queen Alien clearly comprehends the danger Ripley presents to her eggs, indicating for her warriors to back off when Ripley threatens them with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">flamethrower</a>. She's also able to operate the lift to pursue Ripley. The only thing they didn't understand was that overloading atmospheric processor...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienResurrection">Alien: Resurrection</a></em>, the captive xenomorph immediately realises the connection between the blasts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithIce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithIce">cold-gas</a> that hit it and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigRedButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigRedButton">Big Red Button</a>, backing off the instant the scientist moves to hit it a second time. This later serves to bite the ass of a security mook. Likewise the aliens wait till communications are cut off (during security's fight with the mercenaries) before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeNeedADistraction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeNeedADistraction">implementing their escape</a>. They also notice that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigRedButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigRedButton">Big Red Button</a> was locked up at the time. They later lay a trap by herding the humans towards their egg room.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanDeanFoster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanDeanFoster">Alan Dean Foster</a> novelisations bring up this trope several times. Ash suggests they try communicating with the creature as it might be intelligent. The second book has Bishop bringing up the ant analogy and pointing out that the aliens have nested themselves in the one place the humans can't destroy them without destroying themselves (next to the cooling units of the fusion-powered atmosphere processor). And <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alien3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alien3">Alien³</a></em> had the xenomorphs reading the signs outside their cells, which kind of spoils the whole mystery.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AVPAlienVsPredator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AVPAlienVsPredator">AVP: Alien vs. Predator</a></em> shows the Xenomorphs can work around predator setups just as well as human rigs. When the queen realized she couldn't get out of the shackles, she called back all of her offspring and ordered them to attack her so that her blood would corrode the shackles and free her.
</li></ul></li><li> In the horror film <em>Animal</em>, the monster pursues the cast to a cabin in the woods. At first it seems that it's simply a bloodthirsty beast, but it gradually becomes clear that the creature purposely herded them into the cabin to trap them and pick them off one by one.

The protagonists openly wonder if the Cube is watching them and calculating. According to the sequels, there are human operators.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DanceOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DanceOfTheDead">Dance of the Dead</a></em>: Two zombies carjack Jimmy's pizza van while he is arguing with Kyle. Also, one of the zombies at the prom still manages to spike the punch.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Godzilla</a> has shown a surprising amount of intelligence in several films.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla2014">Godzilla (2014)</a></em>, he gives the distinct impression of regarding the protagonist at one point when it eyeballs him close up. The MUTOs hint at it as well, such as when the female figures out that Brody <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">is what</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">killed her eggs.</a>
<ul><li> Another notable moment is the female MUTO seems to actively <em>wait</em> for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the train carrying the nuclear weapons</span> and ambush them, making use of her natural camouflage. Also, it appears by the point of the San Francisco fight, the Mutos have learned to weaponize their EMP abilities (before primarily using the shockwave accompanying it to throw shoulders).
</li><li> At the end of the fight with the male MUTO, Big G is clearly watching, waiting and <em>planning</em>. It doesn't turn to face the threat, as you'd expect an animal under attack to do, but keeps its back toward the approaching MUTO and thus lures into into position to slam it into a skyscraper with an unexpected tail attack. Similarly, it's clearly learned that the female MUTO is resistant to its atomic breath and so forces her mouth open to direct the blast straight down her throat.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gremlins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gremlins">Gremlins</a></em>: A lot of the problems arise from the human characters fatally underestimating the Gremlins' intelligence. After the evil Mogwai are spawned, they trick Billy into feeding them after midnight by sabotaging his digital clock, and on several other occasions they damage equipment to cause accidents, like cutting the brakes of a police car. Stripe knows full well that water creates more Gremlins, so he jumps into a pool when Billy pursues him, and also knows how to operate tools (he attacks Billy with a pistol and a <em>mini-chainsaw</em>).

In later books, however, it turns out they're quite intelligent, and a whole herd of the buggers pulls a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> (or at least agrees to stop eating humans). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">It took them how long to realize the ''talking'' monsters were smart</a>?
</li><li> In Jeff VanderMeer's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ambergris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ambergris">Ambergris-stories</a> many characters express scepticism about the sentience or abilities of the Graycaps, but it's quite clear to the reader that they are quite possibly superhumanly intelligent and extremely dangerous when they want to be. The dual narrators of <em>Shriek: An Afterword</em> make a pretty good case of this being pure denial that the sceptics pursue to protect their own peace of mind.

The Chtorran gastropedes are assumed to be behind things, yet their intelligence is that of the idiot savant — they're very good at opening locks and can somehow communicate over distances, yet little else.

When a device under construction is sabotaged, one resident speculates that the hobgoblins did it, thinking it to be another hobgoblin-killing booby trap. One of the heroines calls him out on this ("They <em>thought</em> it was?"), and the accuser is horrified to realize that he, himself, isn't as convinced that hobgoblins are dumb animals as he'd believed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In fact, the hobgoblins <em>are</em> intelligent, but it's a human who sabotaged the device.</span>

It's a subversion because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the attackers aren't zombies at all, but desperate civilians who'd seen the fortress's TV broadcasts, and are determined to seize this refuge for their families.</span>

Later, the sapient rats go to considerable lengths to avert this trope from their human pursuers' perspective, destroying all evidence of their more civilized lifestyle <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and even leaving a suicide-squad of naked fighters behind, at least some of whom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">are gassed to death,</a> all to "prove" they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">just ordinary rats.</a></span>

</li><li> Subverted in Stephen Baxter's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Evolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Evolution">Evolution</a></em>, in the first flashback. There's mention of a dinosaur that's smarter than the others, but all this means is that it's "smart enough to go insane" - it submerges its survival instincts in order to hold a grudge against one of humanity's ancestors for eating its eggs.
</li><li> In <em>Brains: A Zombie Memoir</em>, some of the human antagonists react this way to the protagonists, who are among the few zombies capable of intelligent thought.
</li><li> Non-monster example: the ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo">Jingo</a></em> suggests that the Curious Squid are somewhat civilized and either built for themselves or adapted to living in the buildings on Leshp.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpaceMarineBattles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpaceMarineBattles">Death of Integrity</a></em> goes to great length to establish that Genestealers aren't just a random packs of feral beasts.

They move closer to the boats, thinking the noise of the propellers will drive it off, before it reveals itself to be David in morph.

Page 100, Chapter 14 (Knowledge spells). It's played for horror here. The funny thing is that it's mentioned again in Chapter 17 (Meta-Spells) on page 121, where the actual enchantments are explained as well as how they work, and again in Chapter 24 (Technological spells), where the reaction in Chapter 14 is played for laughs.

Individually Tyranids are hyper-evolved killing animals, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a> directing them has proven to be frighteningly intelligent, staging ambushes and feigning attacks to probe enemy defences. The Hive Mind has fooled Imperial Guard generals, Space Marine captains, Chaos warlords, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Eldar farseers</a> have been confounded by its tactical prowess.
<ul><li> The Swarmlord is the most advanced, most intelligent Hive Tyrant to ever exist. It's tactical and strategic genius is such that, during the Tyranid's assault on the Ultramarines homeworld, the monster consistently outfoxed the Ultramarines, who are known to be the best Space Marines in terms of adaptability, tactics, and strategy. The Swarmlord is functionally immortal, for each time it's body dies, it's mind is reabsorbed into the Hive Mind so it can be respawned into a new body wherever it is needed anywhere in the galaxy. In this way, it has accumulated eons of combat experience, quite possibly making it the most experienced military leader in the galaxy.

</li><li> During the Great Crusade, to the few that he told anything about Warp entities, the Emperor denied this trope, leading several characters in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy">Horus Heresy</a> series to realize it on their own.

Many human campaigns have failed due to underestimating the Orks' intelligence. Even dumb regular Orks still possess bestial cunning that often surprises their overconfident foes.
<ul><li> Many reports of Ork Kommandos tend to elicit disbelief from most combatants, as they assume that Orks are just too impetuous, bumbling and stupid to care about stealth or subterfuge, nevermind employ it with any degree of effectiveness (to be fair, this is true of most of them, the Blood Axes clan being the exception). However, Snikrot, leader of the Red Skull Kommandos of Armageddon, is an utter genius at sneaky warfare, even by <em>human</em> standards.

The trip line spider of Venus sets up complicated booby traps, the Yetis of Callisto are intelligent, able to slip out of captivity and evade pursuit in the mountains of Germany and then there are creatures that may well be sentient.

But the Zombie Master is given a full palette of intelligence options, from Tool Use (at 1, they can break windows with rocks; at 3, they can <em>drive cars</em>) to Long-Term Memory (they know you went behind that wall, and they know you have to come out sometime) to Problem-Solving (sure, you locked the door, but they can figure out how to move boxes and get into the window). A clever Zombie Master can shock the players with just how much the zombies can learn.

</li><li> Although Bendy falls for Henry hiding in the Little Miracle Stations too, there are some points in the game where it's clear that he's got some level of intelligence.

In Doom 3 and Doom (2016), they receive a massive step up; in 3, Z-SEC zombies can tactically sprint around, firing pistols, shotguns, and submachine guns, compared to the slow, mindless shambling civilian zombies. In the 2016 version, the Possessed Soldiers are tactically cognizant and will make great use of their arm-mounted plasma guns; the Security will even tactically utilize their giant energy riot shields, firing in defilade and dropping the shield at range to adopt a more accurate firing stance. The regular Possessed, on the other hand, are just mindless zombies that shamble at you in a slow gait.

Story-wise, they're at least as intelligent as humans, identifying specific threats and adapting their tactics in response. One can only imagine the horror as the colonists realized that not only were these things massive and deadly, but intelligent as well. In-game, their intelligence depends on the player controlling them. This could range from simply being able to recognize a few strategies to openly toying with the hunters by dissecting and countering their advantages and tactics.

The Deathclaw mother in question simply stands around and waits to see what you do with the egg instead of attacking, when the egg is returned, she covers it up and lets the player character walk away unharmed. It should also be noted that the original thieves were relentlessly tracked over a great distance and slaughtered by an Alpha male Deathclaw because he was trying to get the egg back.

Though they behave like constantly-evolving mindless beasts, they aren't actually "evolving" at all. Instead, they learn new configurations for themselves from the environment. For instance, the Chi-You type Aragami use the "bring it" gesture and martial arts moves. Another Aragami takes it cues from a tank, complete with biological missile launchers, but the treads are crudle turned into misshapen forelegs. This is an enigma in-universe since it clearly implies higher learning ability, yet the only behaviour they display beyond violence and consumption is pack scavenging. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And then there are humanoid Aragami, who can very quickly learn how social structures work, and eventually internal concepts like empathy.</span>

In the backstory, however, is the way the first outbreak occurred: after the test subjects - a few citizens of a small town - were infected, nothing happened at all for <em>four years</em> until the scientists who'd expected a spectacular response packed up and let their guard down. At that point <em>every single subject</em> - by then <em>the entire town</em> - suddenly mutated and attacked all at once. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">The Virus</a> had waited patiently, spreading quietly, for just such an opportunity.

</li></ul></li><li> Many of the monsters from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> series have varying displays of intelligence.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a> remake of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1">the first game</a> uses this as a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a> when battling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicMonster">Lisa Trevor</a>.

<div class="indent"><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><strong>Lisa:</strong> Moth...ther...</span>
</div></li><li> The Nemesis from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Nemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Nemesis">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a></em>. Unlike all the other monsters up to this point, it is smart enough to follow orders, track the main character, open doors, use weapons, set ambushes, and <em>speak</em> (albeit only one word: "S.T.A.R.S.", his mission target). Even when Jill tries to make her escape via helicopter, Nemesis is smart enough to <em>shoot the helicopter with a rocket launcher to cut off her escape</em>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0i4cy');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0i4cy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0i4cy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though not smart enough to <em>wait for her to board the helicopter first</em>. Later game events imply, especially in the remake, that he's purposely toying with her to make his hunt more fun.</span>
</li><li> Those infected with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite">Las Plagas</a>, as seen in both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5">5</a></em>, are practically human in intelligence. They are capable of using weaponry, setting traps, cooperating with each other, and (depending on the actual host) can even speak properly. A good example would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMooksClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMooksClothing">the Verdugo</a>. If you blast it with a rocket launcher, it shrugs off the explosion <em>and tauntingly wags its "finger" at you before resuming its attack</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil6">Resident Evil 6</a></em> features several monsters that are quite intelligent than the standard RE enemies:
<ul><li> First off, the game features an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilKnockoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilKnockoff">evil(er) knockoff</a> of The Nemesis with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">Ustanak</a>. It's smart enough to predict where you're going and set a trap rather than just smash through the wall to keep chasing you, select and equip weapons, and even deploy small flying creatures in a search pattern to cut off your escape and track you down. And if you think you outsmarted it by hiding in the dumpster, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">try it three times</a>.
</li><li> Secondly, The C-Virus zombies are considerably smarter than the T-Virus ones. They can use tools such as melee weapons and guns (though not very well), and even climb over obstacles such as fences.
</li><li> Lastly there's the J'Avo, who have retained almost at the very least enough intelligence to behave like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">normal soldiers.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Rachael</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilRevelations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilRevelations">Resident Evil: Revelations</a></em> seems to exhibit this trope when it starts jumping out or air vents to attack you.
</li></ul></li><li> The Scurge in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ScurgeHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ScurgeHive">Scurge: Hive</a></em>.
<ul><li> Interestingly enough, it's initially averted, then the aversion subverted, because a mid-game conversation points out that the Scurge originally didn't have any sort of sentient thought. It only began to develop such after absorbing enough sentient life that it began to form its own collective mindset and began planning its escape.
</li></ul></li><li> Several mutants in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER">STALKER</a></em> will use this:
<ul><li> One notable example has you wandering through an abandoned building and hearing the sound of a crying baby, coming from inside a closet. There's a Burer waiting inside for you to open the door.
</li><li> Another example of this has a Controller growling to you a chilling warning (<strong>"LEAVE HERE, MAN!"</strong>) should you approach the entrance of the cave it's dwelling inside.
</li><li> As for Bloodsuckers, well, they will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance">use dangerously efficient stalking and hunting tactics when facing you</a>, and you <em>will</em> feel like prey if you're attacked by more than one of them at once. There's also a bit where one leaves a dying man on the floor crying out for help as bait to lure you into the open so it can pounce.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft">StarCraft</a></em>:

Kerrigan's broodmothers are capable of autonomy and building up a force, but lack the strategic vision to be truly dangerous, so she has them intentionally made smarter. When pointed out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">this makes them a danger to her, too</a>, she says she wants them as dangerous as possible.

It comes as a horrifying realization to the characters that this one is actually intelligent. It's smart enough to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">leave Gortys alive because it knows that it will disappear if she is killed</span>, and when hit with an ineffective attack, it <em>laughs</em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em>:

They do not attack humans on sight because they know that killing one human will just bring more, enough that the Grimm will be overwhelmed. The eldest Grimm are opportunists, remaining patient and attacking only when they sense weakness in humanity. They're even seen directing younger Grimm and coordinating their attacks, showing an understanding of battlefield tactics.

After one of them remarks that raptors are too intelligent to be held in a closet, the raptor slips a newspaper under the door, rattles the door until the key falls out, retrieves the key, and unlocks the door before continuing to attack. Taking it one step further, the raptor then produces a calabash pipe and then proceeds to explain in a posh accent the raptors' plan to "build a crude suspension bridge to Venezuela, where I shall lie low and assume odd jobs under the name 'Mr. Pilkington.' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayingTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayingTooMuch">But perhaps I've said too much</a>."

This culminates in "Evolution" when he responds to Starscream's latest abuse by <em>transforming</em> and threatening to kill Starscream. Megatron for one is very unhappy with this turn of events. He wanted a mindless beast he could control. Instead, he got a powerful, intelligent, and ambitious warrior who is a potential threat.
<div class="indent"><strong>Predaking</strong>: I only recently became aware of my abilities. All I remember of my beginning is hunting, and battle, and the wounding of my pride.

<ul><li> It is now believed that most complex life forms that aren't plants have some form of decision-making mechanism and the ability to adapt to their surroundings. Current research focuses on figuring out how and to what extent each species does these things.
</li><li> Jumping spiders of the <em>Portia</em> genus. They hunt other spiders, and will observe other spiders in their webs until they can gauge how fast they are and how they react to disturbances so that they can determine the optimal strategy to take them down. They will even observe a spider's mating display so they can <em>imitate it</em> and attract another spider to its doom.
<ul><li> Since the web vibrations they need to imitate vary from species to species, a Portia memorizes different chords, and experiments when it encounters a species it hasn't before.
</li></ul></li><li> In reality, watch any well-made nature show and you will more than likely view 8 to 10 animals that fall well within this trope. And if they are predators, or especially scavengers, they definitely fall within this trope.
<ul><li> A great example would be elephants. The one way most scientists gauge self-awareness is whether or not the subject can recognize their reflection as themselves as opposed to another animal. With animals, it can be a bit tricky to determine as they can't talk. However, one test is to put a mark on the animal which the animal cannot see but will be reflected in a mirror. Elephants have demonstrated recognition of their reflection by exploring the mark on their own head, not the elephant in the mirror, using the mirror to find it. So, elephants are self-aware.
<ul><li> A modified version of this test has been used on dogs, using smells in place of visual marks, as dogs are not visually-oriented, and the dogs proved self-aware according to the test.
</li></ul></li><li> Chimpanzees in particular may be even more intelligent than we generally give them credit for. Scientists studying chimps in parts of Africa which are still densely forested have observed them not only using tools, but fashioning some of their own.
<ul><li> Chimps have also joined elephants in being self-aware. They also used the mirrors to check out their own genitals, but the point was still proven!
</li><li> Heck, great apes are actually legally recognized as <em>people</em> in some countries!
</li><li> And dolphins, when introduced to mirrors, exhibit behavior that they never do any other time such as flapping their fins, watching themselves do it. One scientist suggests it's similar to the way a person will make funny faces or pose in front of a mirror.
</li></ul></li><li> Some pigs have been taught to <em>play video games.</em>
</li><li> Add <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleverCrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleverCrows">ravens, crows and magpies</a> (corvids) to the mix - the first non-mammals confirmed to have this ability, along with rudimentary skills at using tools and cooperating to solve puzzles. A group of crows in Tokyo have figured out how to use cars to crack open nuts that they cannot open on their own. They drop the nuts into the crosswalks, wait for the cars to drive over them, then fly down and eat the interior when the traffic stops. Now, add to this that they are using the <em>traffic lights</em> to time this operation...
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_17453_5-diabolical-animals-that-out-witted-humans.html">Another group of crows in Kagoshima, Japan,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> have become frighteningly good at <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/07/world/asia/07crows.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=2&amp;">outsmarting the Crow Patrol put together specifically to get rid of them.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> They're also capable of vividly remembering a person or location that's caused trouble. If a member of the murder is killed, they're <em>not</em> coming back any time soon, and in fact reroute their migratory pattern to avoid landing in that area. If they've been harassed by someone, they may start fighting back, often singling that person out when given the chance. They can even teach other crows what that person looks like.
</li><li> New Caledonian crows are so smart that <a class="urllink" href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/08/0808_020808_crow.html">one actually figured out from a failed attempt by another crow how to make a functional tool,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> without the scientists being aware that New Caledonian crows even knew <em>how</em> to make tools, much less adapt them.
</li><li> Tests on crows and other corvids have confirmed they understand water displacement, and even more recently can determine which object is the heavier of a pair by how they move in a wind tunnel, a test most primates fail (after all, most primates don't spend a lot of their time flying).
</li><li> There's even footage of a crow in a puzzle room who clearly understands the concept of puzzles. He works hard to obtain a stick, merely because it was behind a barrier, and then once he obtains the stick, he looks around for a place to use it.
</li></ul></li><li> Keas are pretty bloody bright as well, being parrots. In fact as a whole, parrots and corvids are the brightest bird groups.
</li><li> And swallows! <a class="urllink" href="http://www.purplemartin.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4311&amp;sid=c4a5398f465dbc107a7ced18e151176b">Birds nesting near the entry of a Home Depot have figured out how to work the motion detectors to open the doors.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> They've even figured out that a person is responsible for the doors not working (being locked) and will harass that person until he unlocks the doors. Just. That. Person.
</li></ul></li><li> Lions are not large enough to take down giraffes on their own. But, lions in some parts of Africa have figured out that if you <em>scare</em> the giraffes so that they run into a road with heavy traffic, the cars will kill the giraffe for you and you can get a lot of tasty dinner rather easily. This is causing serious traffic problems in some areas.
<ul><li> Hyenas have a complex, simian-like social structure. They may even be <em>better</em> at cooperating and teaching than many primate species - given a task where two animals must tug at separate ropes simultaneously to get a food reward, but only one knows the trick, the hyenas were <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/09/090928131032.htm">faster than primates<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> at teaching their buddy how to do it. This is likely because hyenas hunt together and so need a "language" for cooperating and coordinating an attack, while most primate food is fairly lazy fruit, and the most you need to be able to say to share with a friend is "Here is food".
</li><li> There were a pair of tigers raised in captivity and being prepared for a release into the wild. On their first day out hunting, one went straight for a herd of deer, completely failing to be stealthy. The other wandered off to who knows where. The conservationists thought they had wasted all that effort until the noisy one drove the entire herd into the ambush set up by the one they thought had gotten lost. Tigers cooperating like that had never been seen before.
</li></ul></li><li> Housepets, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicDog">especially dogs,</a> have been known to seek help when their owners are in trouble.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_19213_7-animals-that-are-evolving-right-before-our-eyes.html">As noted in this Cracked article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, dogs that live in the Moscow Subway system can use the trains to get around and have learned the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCute">Rule of Cute</a> to get food for the pack.
</li><li> Octopuses. If not given puzzles and toys to keep itself occupied (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">octopied?</a>), an aquarium octopus will invariably occupy itself by trying to escape. Sometimes they end up in other exhibits. Sometimes they end up <em>eating</em> the other exhibits. In one case, a <em>very</em> bored octopus <a class="urllink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3328480/Otto-the-octopus-wreaks-havoc.html">took to using tankmates as toys,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> when he wasn't turning off the lights with carefully aimed jets of water or rearranging his tank.
<ul><li> Remember that "other exhibits" part? Tumblr has a story about how <a class="urllink" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2014/08/22/friday-cephalopod-dancing-on-the-edge-of-the-abyss/#comment-842723">one aquarium couldn't figure out why some of its crustaceans kept disappearing.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> It turned out to be an octopus sneaking out of a small hole in its tank, learning the guard's patrols like it was a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> protagonist, and walking across to the crustacean tank.
</li><li> Another supposedly was doing the same, but walking across an elevated walkway, unlocking the other tank, eating, relocking the tank, and sneaking back.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL3M_DcO6wk">They can unscrew the lid of a jar from the inside.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> Crocodiles show a surprising amount of intelligence. They are known to be able to memorize where the best places to ambush prey are, some species have learned to steal fish from the nets of fishing boats, and it's estimated that they may be about as smart as some rodents (Which, considering how clever mice and rats can be, is pretty impressive).
<ul><li> It was found that Nile Crocodiles hunt in packs, or more accurately they are perfectly willing to use teamwork. Sometimes, one crocodile will hold a large prey animal and let the others (who take turns and equal portions) tear at it. They also herd prey or surround them, and at times, large groups will gather to block off rivers and feast on the trapped fish.
</li><li> Crocodiles can learn tricks like "stay" or "roll over" meaning they're at the same level (or little below) of intelligence as dogs. The difference comes from the fact an average croc would gladly kill and eat his trainer.
</li><li> At least two species (The Mugger Crocodile of India and the American Alligator) have some grasp of <a class="urllink" href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/2013/11/30/tool-use-in-crocs-and-gators/">tool usage.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Scientists have observed them consistently gathering sticks during nesting season, and carefully balancing them across their snouts as they lay in wait beneath the nests of Herons and Egrets. This allows them to bait unsuspecting birds straight onto their snouts, for an easy kill.
</li><li> On a similar note, Komodo Dragons are intelligent, having a natural tendency to play, know how to take advantage of tourists and can recognize names given to them and different voices, as well. In captivity, they seem to display individual personalities. This trope applies to all monitor lizards, in fact, and they are considered the smartest among lizard groups and similar to wolves in intelligence. They are more than capable of strategizing when hunting and often do so.
</li></ul></li><li> Studies show that constrictors (IE: Pythons, boas, and anacondas) may be more intelligent than previously thought. Research shows that these snakes check to make sure their prey is dead when they're constricting. Long story short, an experiment was held where the snakes would constrict a meal with a simulated heartbeat. The snakes would only stop if they were sure their prey's heart had stopped beating.
<ul><li> Considering that spitting cobras are able to aim their venom with remarkable accuracy, that should indicate that there is some level of comprehension of precision in them.
</li><li> Black mambas, king cobras and taipans are considered the snakes with the greatest potential for killing people, and this isn't just due to their size, toxicity, amount of venom, speed, and aggression. These are extremely alert and aware snakes that are highly curious and quick to react. This makes them extremely hard to handle and they are some of the most likely snakes to escape in zoos. The only reason they cause relatively few fatalities is the lack of human contact.
</li><li> Large pythons, boas, and even king cobras have been documented as being capable of recognizing their owners. Studies have shown that a snake is less likely to bite someone it's familiar with than someone they don't know.
</li></ul></li><li> Why are orcas so popular at aquariums? It's not only since they're big and agile. They're also arguably some of the smartest things in the ocean, often just following a fishing boat and looting the net, not to mention <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense">beaching themselves</a> to get a snack.
<ul><li> Transient orca pods hunting Dolphins are known to stop using their active echolocation, and indeed any noise altogether while on the hunt, as their prey are capable of echolocation, and attempting active echolocation would give the orcas away before they got a clear "look" at the dolphins anyway. Instead, they stay silent, sweeping the ocean for the dolphin's own echolocation, then following it to their prey. Yes, orcas hunting dolphins is basically Mother Nature's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotSubOnSubAction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotSubOnSubAction">Hot Sub-on-Sub Action</a>.
</li><li> Orcas have also learned how to snatch the bait fish off of longlines without getting caught in the hooks, and teach others how to do it.
</li><li> One pod in Australia set up a cooperative hunting partnerships with (human) whalers in a small town. When whales migrated through the area, the orcas would begin herding them into the town's bay, while one or more orcas would head to the dock to get the attention of the humans and let them know whales were coming in, and the orcas and the humans would work together to kill the whales. At the end of the hunt, the humans allowed the orcas to eat the lips and tongues of their catch, which the humans had no use for, with the orcas leaving the blubber and baleen, which the humans wanted.
</li><li> There's an old joke that there's no known cases of orcas killing humans in the wild. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadAuthor">Orcas don't leave witnesses.</a>
</li><li> Pods of orcas have been observed pushing baby seals back to shore, rather than eating them. It is believed the orcas are engaging in what is essentially livestock management, ensuring a future generation <em>and</em> a better meal when the seal matures.
</li><li> Orcas off the coast of California have learned that if they turn any kind of shark upside-down, it experiences "tonic immobility" and stops moving completely. After being held for a few minutes, the shark will die from lack of oxygen, and the orcas can snack on tasty shark liver at their leisure. Thankfully, the orcas that practice this aren't big enough to try this on adult great whites, but they have killed juveniles.
</li><li> And in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhzfVnwx8cA">this video,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> when their prey is apparently safely on an ice floe, they work together to make a wave to knock it off and into the water. They have essentially made a real life version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash">Making a Splash</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Sharks and rays are also highly intelligent, on the level of most mammals. Stingrays have been known to use tools and sharks will often join forces to hunt. Some species will hunt in highly coordinated packs: in one incident in New Zealand, a dive team was studying broadnose sevengill sharks when one made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeNeedADistraction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeNeedADistraction">very obvious</a> threatening movement toward one of the divers. When the dive team focused on it, another shark tried to attack them from behind. Fortunately, no one was injured, but they had to review their safety precautions after that.
<ul><li> And where there's intelligence, there's personality. When the Monterey Bay Aquarium was keeping (juvenile) great white sharks, it was notable how some were intensely interested in the human visitors on the other side of the glass, while others were just interested in doing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws">Jaws</a> impression waiting for food.
</li></ul></li><li> Moray eels are capable of inter-species communication to hunt in a coordinated manner. <a class="urllink" href="http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/04/24/groupers-use-gestures-to-recruit-morays-for-hunting-team-ups/">No, really.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Babies and toddlers can understand complex language well before they can reproduce it. If you underestimate them just because they aren't talking yet, they <em>will</em> outsmart you. And you will feel stupid.
<ul><li> In general, humans have a tendency to misconstrue lack of verbal responses for lack of intelligence, and tend to be surprised when it turns out that, despite it seeming obvious to those who read it on paper, the mute/nonverbal person actually <em>does</em> fully understand what you're saying, and <em>will</em> feel deeply insulted if you're talking shit about them within earshot. This dilemma is a particularly big problem for nonverbal autistic people, many of whom, especially in adulthood, feel like they have to "prove" that they are indeed intelligent.
</li></ul></li><li> While it is debated as to how intelligent they were, dinosaurs are now believed to be much smarter than we once thought they were. For years, dinosaurs were believed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbDinos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbDinos">slow-witted lumbering beasts who did little more than eat, fight, and have babies.</a> However, over the years, we've discovered that some species (particularly small meat-eating dinosaurs) were at least intelligent enough to form complex social behaviors.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrannosaurusRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrannosaurusRex">Tyrannosaurus rex</a> was not only one of the largest predators ever to walk the earth, it was also pretty smart. Studies indicate that it might've been at least as intelligent as modern-day alligators or even some breeds of dog.
</li></ul></li><li> Not only is the honey badger famous for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRabbit">sheer ferocity,</a> it's also remarkably smart. It's one of the few animals that's been documented using tools.
<ul><li> At least one captive honey badger named "Stoffel" has become notorious for being something of a "badger Houdini". He's managed to escape his pen several times using tree branches, rocks, mud, and even a rake as a means to get him over the wall of his enclosure. At one point, he even figured out how to pick the locks of his cage with the help of his mate "Hammy". It's gotten to the point where his owner had to put an electric fence around his enclosure to keep him contained. And, even then, it seems Stoffel is already trying to figure out a way to get past that.
</li></ul></li><li> Bees (especially honeybees and bumblebees) are also incredibly intelligent. They can navigate mazes using things like color recognition, landmarks, and lighting. When collecting nectar, they can memorize the locations of several different flowers, remember the <em>time of day</em> each of them produce nectar, and find their way home from two miles away. Once home, they relay these facts to the rest of the hive by dancing.
</li><li> Pigeons, while common and overlooked, are as smart as corvids and parrots, if not smarter. A pigeon can be placed anywhere on the planet and will find its way home each time, even if it's never been to that area before. Recently, it's also been discovered that they recognize human faces, and will quickly determine which humans are trustworthy and which ones to avoid. They're also shown to learn things (like math, for example) in a similar way to human children, right down to making the same kinds of beginners' mistakes.
<ul><li> Seagulls are similar to pigeons, but much more ferocious in their tactics. They've also wised up to the fact that women are more likely to drop their things and flee than men when attacked by a flock, and started acting accordingly by targeting women who seem to be carrying something delicious to eat. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3175036/Now-seagulls-cunning-Packs-birds-target-women-develop-new-tactics-steal-lunch.html">This article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> compares them to the classic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a></em> movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirds">The Birds</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The false cleanerfish resembles the more friendly cleaner fish. It tricks other fish into letting it approach, then bites a chunk out of it and retreats instead of cleaning it of parasites. This trick best works on juveniles, as adult fish who have been attacked before will actively avoid the false cleanerfish or even attack it on sight, indicating the adults have memory. Even more impressive, the adult fish learn to tell the difference between false and true cleaner fish.
</li><li> Pufferfish are quite intelligent. They are capable of recognizing the faces (and possibly voices) of their owners, and can be taught basic tricks (For example, going to a certain part of their tank to get food).
<ul><li> Not only are they smart, but they can be rather artistic too. The male of one species native to Japan is known to build elaborate <a class="urllink" href="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p02c72bf.jpg">circular nests.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> These nests take days (if not weeks) for the puffers to build and are used to attract mates to be used as nurseries for their fry. Not only that, but they are considered some of the most complex forms of nest building in the animal kingdom. And, to think, all the puffer uses to build theses nests are his fins and his incredible knowledge of geometric shapes.
</li></ul></li><li> Even arthropods get involved in the action! One researcher studying cockroach reproductive habits noted that her research subjects eventually learned to recognize their handlers, and act differently around them than other humans.
</li><li> A popular video on Youtube shows the startled reactions of various cats to their owners using a 'cat-face' filter on their <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cats+respond+to+cat+filter">smartphones.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The surprising thing about this is that the cats seem to recognize themselves in the phone screen and look up at their owners to double-check that they haven't turned into big cats.
</li><li> One afternoon, a woman named Benita Rogers was sitting with her visiting parents in the living room when her cat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">Midnight</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicPetStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicPetStory">was trying to get her attention. She shooed him away...then heard some bloodcurdling moaning and screeching noises coming from her baby monitor. Benita rushed upstairs to find her six-week-old daughter Stacey suffering from respiratory failure and Midnight howling into the other monitor.</a> Fortunately, she arrived just in time to save her daughter, thanks to Midnight understanding how the baby monitor worked and realizing that Benita would respond to noises coming from it.
