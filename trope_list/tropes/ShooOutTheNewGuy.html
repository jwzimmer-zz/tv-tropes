While he does have his fans, many people didn't like Tracey and wanted Brock to come back. Once Ash and co. made it back to Kanto, Tracey decided to become Prof. Oak's assistant and Brock came back to travel alongside Ash, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">thus reducing Tracey to an extra</a>.

Then the writer probably realized that it's Clare and the Seven Ghosts' story the readers wanted to see, and Clarice was shifted to the background again, with her and Miata's arc resolution wedged into the final battle sequences between the <em>main</em> main characters and the overarching villains.

By the end of the season, he's reunited with her mother and it's revealed that Hibiki's new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catchphrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catchphrase">catchphrase</a> for the season ("It's fine, totally fine!") was acquired from him. However, fandom reception to Hibiki's father was near-universally negative, with people considering him abusive, annoying, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallyUnsympathetic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallyUnsympathetic">Unintentionally Unsympathetic</a>, and generally scummy. As a result, in the following two seasons, he doesn't appear at all bar the occasional mention (a mention that confirms Hibuki's parents to still be separated), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbandonedCatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbandonedCatchPhrase">his catchphrase has vanished from Hibiki's vocabulary</a> in favor of "But even so!"

They also broke the theme by having straightforward naming schemes (Light and Dark as opposed to Frost, Firestorm, or Shadow) and not needing to be Tribute Summoned. However, fans found the pair to be too slow and indirect, stuck with the original six, and by the time of <em>Arc-V,</em> with the release of new Monarch support, Kuraz and Delg are nowhere to be seen on card art.

Magog made a huge splash, was subject to a MASSIVE multi-part storyline and ultimately given both his own comic book AND his own spin-off JSA team book!

</li><li> Likewise, the sister book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewMutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewMutants">New Mutants</a></em> had Rusty Collins and Skids, who were added to the book as part of a group of kids called the X-Terminators. While initially important, they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedByMountainLions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedByMountainLions">left behind to fend against Freedom Force and search for mutant children while the others went to Asgard</a>.

All were introduced and removed in the same arc, without even doing anything significant to the plot, due to backlash from before the story was even published.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanHickman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanHickman">Jonathan Hickman</a>'s run had the same problem.

</li><li> Scott Lang joined the team at the end of Millar's Avengers vs. New Ultimates series, but was quickly forgotten about.
</li><li> Sam Humphries later introduced the Ultimate version of Stature from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/YoungAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/YoungAvengers">Young Avengers</a>, and even wrote a scene where she was offered membership in the team. His run ended shortly after this, so she never got a chance to join the Ultimates.

She was introduced as a major player in Joe Kelly's run, but she never really caught on and was eventually written out of the book. Aside from joining a short-lived incarnation of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoomPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoomPatrol">Doom Patrol</a></em>, she's mostly been in Comic Book Limbo since then.
</li><li> Doctor Light from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JusticeLeagueInternational" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JusticeLeagueInternational">Justice League International</a></em>. Despite appearing on the cover of the first issue and being featured in promotional art for the series, she only appeared in a small handful of issues (where she didn't really do anything notable or even wear her costume) before quitting the team.
</li><li> Thunderfox from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Femforce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Femforce">Femforce</a></em> was introduced with much fanfare, but only appeared in eight issues before disappearing. The explanation occurred five issues after her last appearance, telling us that her 'book' was cancelled.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHoodAndTheOutlaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHoodAndTheOutlaws">Red Hood and the Outlaws</a></em>, Crux was going to be a main team member after being mentioned in interviews and given a backstory, but the fans didn't care for him and the writer decided he didn't fit in. Sent to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Arkham</a>, until next needed. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a> relaunch of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>, by the same writer, introduced two new members to the team: Bunker and Skitter. Skitter was very, <em>very</em> quickly (and quietly) written out of the book due to less-than-stellar fan reception, though she would eventually reappear just prior to a relaunch that ended up not involving her.

He was introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Amazing Spider-Man</a></em> #692 as a frighteningly average, under achieving, generally ignored 15-year-old kid who got amazing superpowers via a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakLabAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakLabAccident">Freak Lab Accident</a> during a field-trip to a presentation made by none other than Peter Parker. He even had a little hype behind him and became Spider-Man's sidekick. Having such low self-worth, it isn't long before everything starts going to Alpha's head. Though it wasn't two issues later where he messes up big time, almost causing some planes to crash, when Spider-Man almost completely de-powers him. And just like that, he's out of the comic after only 3 issues. He was even called this trope's former name, The Poochie, in-universe! Of course, since he later got his own miniseries, it becomes easier to realize that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">this was planned from the start.</a>

Touted as a new and unique addition to the Cosmic mythos, Wraith instead came off as a mix of Drizzt Do'Urden and Jackie Estacado, with the depth of neither and more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonMarySueTraits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonMarySueTraits">Common Mary Sue Traits</a> than one could shake a shapeshifting gun-whip-sword at.

The character was very poorly received and was gone by the 7th season premiere. Creator Susan Bloodworth-Thomason blamed herself and the writers for not creating a more multi-dimensional character for Duffy to play. Jan Hooks was more successful as Jean Smart's replacement and was kept around for the final season.

She was promptly killed off in the following adventure, the 12-part epic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E4TheDaleksMasterPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E4TheDaleksMasterPlan">"The Daleks' Master Plan"</a> in part four. According to the actress who played Katarina, her death scene was <em>the very first scene she was filmed in</em>. This means that the writers created the character, tried her out, decided she wasn't working, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">dropped a bridge on her</a> before <em>a single scene of her had been filmed</em> (and possibly before the character was even cast).

Kamelion was an actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> robot... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup">whose designer died suddenly without telling anybody how to operate the blasted thing</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16mpm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note16mpm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16mpm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Or so they claimed at the time. One of the writers has since admitted that the Kamelion prop didn't deliver anything its creator had promised it would, and they came up with the "died without leaving any documentation" cover story as a way to write Kamelion out without speaking ill of the dead.</span> Technically, Kamelion was a companion for nearly a full year. In practice, he only showed up in 2 adventures, the one where he came on board the TARDIS and the one where the writers said "Enough's enough" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">Dropped a Bridge on Him</a>.

<ul><li> Around the third season Alfred, Jimmy and Ivy were introduced. Beyond getting involved in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor">Romantic Plot Tumor</a> with each other and various other members of staff, none of them did anything of particular note, and were phased out one by one. By the second episode of season five, they were all gone.
</li><li> There is the legendarily despised Sarah Bunting. The audience never really took to her in Series 4, especially as she was essentially just a déclassé version of Lady Sybil without the inherent charm. Come Series 5, her character becomes so incredibly unlikeable that it's pretty clear this was done to justify her aborted romance arc with Branson, and subsequent swift exit.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDukesOfHazzard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDukesOfHazzard">The Dukes of Hazzard</a></em>: Coy and Vance, the "New Dukes", whose characters had been created out of necessity after series stars John Schneider and Tom Wopat walked out on the show during the filming hiatus between the fourth and fifth seasons due to a dispute with the producers. When Schneider and Wopat settled their dispute, they were invited back  in large part to stem hemorrhaging ratings due to Coy and Vance being widely despised  and the "New Dukes" were written out as "needing to care for a sick relative." After one quick scene between the four actors, Coy and Vance were gone... permanently and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson">never to be referred to again</a>.
</li><li> The Ferrera family on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EastEnders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EastEnders">EastEnders</a></em> was introduced to compensate for the lack of South Asian characters on the show. They were introduced with a great deal of hype, but became immensely unpopular despite at least one storyline that threatened to elevate them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Spotlight-Stealing Squad</a> status. Viewers complained that these characters were deathly boring and the writers didn't research the Ferreras' ethnic background. The show had planned a major storyline based around the family's children killing abusive patriarch Dan, which might have redeemed them in the eyes of viewers - but Dan's actor ran into problems with his permit to work in the UK, and Dan was written out overnight. Writers then gave the Ferreras a new storyline where they discover that their friend Tariq is their long-lost half brother, allowing him to donate a kidney to another member of the family. The so-called "Kidneygate" became hugely unpopular (not least because it made Tariq's past romance with the Ferreras' daughter incestuous - even though the characters insisted they had never had sex.) Worse, other plots planned for the show had to be changed or cancelled due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">various illnesses and pregnancies of other cast members</a>, meaning that for months on end "Kidneygate" was the show's main storyline. When it became clear that the Ferreras were more hated than ever, the remaining characters were hastily written out by having a gangster bully them out of town.
<ul><li> A similar case occurred previously with the Di Marco family. They were greatly hyped after their debut and were supposed to rival the long-running Mitchell family, but their fancy Italian restaurant didn't quite fit into the atmos of Albert Square and none of their storylines really caught on with viewers. They were finally written out en masse in a rather poorly thought out exit (the entire family, despite their in-fighting, leave together to move in with a random uncle). Beppe and his son lingered on a while longer but were written out when their current storyline came to an end, since the writers could think of nothing else to do with them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER">ER</a></em>: Lucy Knight, who from her first episode was shoved into the audience's face at the expense of established characters, then abruptly dropped into the background when it was realized that she wasn't fitting in, before finally being killed off a mere 1.5 years into her tenure.
<ul><li> From the sixth season on, there were a multitude of examples, including:
<ul><li> Dr. Cleo Finch, who was a pediatric resident, incredibly beautiful and...that's about it. To make her more interesting, the writers paired her up with Dr. Benton, but it seemed like the artificial situation that it was. She ended up being written out by simply having her take another job.
</li><li> Dr. David Malucci, or "Doctor Dave", who could have been a fun character. He was written to be the replacement for Doug Ross's rebellious lothario character, but the writers forgot to have him actually be a good doctor. Also, while Doug Ross certainly had a chip on his shoulder in regard to bureaucratic senior staff who he saw as standing in the way of patient care, Doctor Dave just seemed flippant and more concerned with having fun, and few of the other characters even liked him. He had a couple of moments later on where the audience got to see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">other sides of him</a>, but ultimately it was too little, too late, as most viewers already thought of him as annoying and wondered why he hadn't already been kicked out of the residency program. Ultimately that's exactly what happened.
</li><li> Dr. Ray Barnett, an intern who was also in a band. He provided a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor">Romantic Plot Tumor</a> between himself, Neela and Gallant, but he combined the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">Small Name, Big Ego</a> of Dr. Pratt (where it worked because Pratt was proved a skilled doctor) and the all-play-no-work characteristic of Doctor Dave, and was written out in a brutal fashion: losing both legs in a car accident.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The entirety of the region of the Dorne could be seen as the Poochie of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GeneralHospital" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GeneralHospital">General Hospital</a></em>. At the end of 1996, Jax' presumed dead first wife Miranda showed up at his wedding to Brenda, obviously the writers intent to give Jax a backstory and make the Sonny/Brenda/Jax <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> a quadrangle. It was also strongly hinted that she was somehow linked to the mysterious Cassadine family. Unfortunately, the character completely failed to catch on, resulting in her leaving town just a few months after she appeared.
</li><li> This happened to most of the new kids on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>. Really, the only new kids who had any staying power were Sam and Blaine:
<ul><li> First was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrawnHilda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrawnHilda">tomboyish athlete</a> Lauren, originally a background character who was bribed by Puck into joining New Directions in the middle of season 2 and later started dating him and bonded with other members of the group. Come Season 3, however, she appeared just long enough to dump him and leave New Directions because it was no longer "cool enough" for her.
</li><li> Season 3's own additions were foreign exchange student Rory, delusional rich girl Sugar, and Christian hippie Joe, all of whom had compelling storylines during the season. While Rory's disappearance in Season 4 can be justified by him returning to Ireland, Sugar and Joe were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a> early in the season before they eventually just stopped appearing.
</li><li> Season 4 was perhaps the worst in this regard, since half of the glee club graduated at the end of 3, and the show made a big deal hyping up the "New New Directions", composed of the current seniors (the members who didn't graduate last year) along with five new kids: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIngenue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIngenue">Marley</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue">Jake</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">Unique</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoggedNiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoggedNiceGuy">Ryder</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Kitty</a>. Unfortunately none of them really caught on with viewers, possibly due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy">having character concepts similar to the members who graduated</a>. By this point the show was split between the cast in Lima and the grads who moved to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity">New York City</a> to follow their dreams, and since the latter was much better received by viewers, the show eventually dropped Lima altogether halfway through Season 5... but then went back there for the final season (and except for Marley, the five new kids all appeared).

This was a clear attempt to mimic the success of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TouchedByAnAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TouchedByAnAngel">Touched by an Angel</a></em> that failed miserably, with the character being written out within a few months.

<ul><li> Sadie is almost too perfect an example of everything mentioned at the top of the page: she shows up out of the blue in Season 5, where it's revealed that she was apparently Meredith's BFF in med school, despite having never been so much as mentioned by Meredith prior to this. Originally intended to become another major intern character as well as a lesbian romantic foil for one of the series regulars, she stuck around just long enough for her to prove she was not only crazy incompetent but also just plain crazy. Promptly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">quit her job at the hospital</a> before the end of the season.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays">Happy Days</a></em>, Pinky Tuscadero and Sticks were both hyped in promos as new characters, but neither appeared for more than an arc before disappearing. Pinky's sister Leather was a stand-in for Pinky — whose actress apparently caused problems — but even she did not appear very often. Other examples include down-home hick cousin K.C. Cunningham and Fonzie's temporary girlfriend and her daughter for the first post-Richie season.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em>:
<ul><li> West's much-trumpeted relationship with Claire ended in the final episode of Series 2, leaving a way for him to be left out in the future because he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">poorly received by fans</a>. The show's creator has stated in an interview that one of the mistakes he made with this series was writing the romance badly. He did, however, appear in the graphic novels that run concurrent to the television show, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one of the freedom fighters working with Rebel</span>. He also played a role, though off-screen, in the last season, when Peter visited him to gain his flying ability.
</li><li> Similarly, Alejandro and Maya were included in season 2 and initially teased as major characters. After much angst, Alejandro is murdered by Sylar, Maya is cured of her powers, and they are never referenced again.
</li><li> Monica Dawson was written out the same time West was and was equally hated.
</li><li> DL could count seeing as he wasn't introduced until episode 5. He was killed offscreen in possibly the lamest way possible. (Niki developing a THIRD personality WHICH IS NEVER SEEN AGAIN)
</li><li> Any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> other than Sylar was destined not to last long:
<ul><li> Adam Monroe is introduced in Season 2, revealed to be a bad guy about halfway through, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">buried alive</a> in the Season finale. He is then brought back in Season 3, only to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a> by Arthur Petrelli within an episode.
</li><li> The build-up to Season 3 trumpeted the four new 'Level 5' villains who were said by Angela Petrelli to be "just as bad or worse" than Sylar. Jesse and 'The German' of them are dead by the time they've had a couple of lines, Knox is killed in the Volume 3 finale, which Flint survives but thereafter is never seen again except in the comics.
</li><li> Arthur Petrelli is introduced in the middle of Volume 3, quickly becomes by far the most powerful character on the show, and is then abruptly killed by Sylar.
</li><li> Emile Danko is introduced in Volume 4, then killed off in Episode 1 of Volume 5.

Hunter's partner/sidekick Dee Dee McCall, her character was replaced by Officer Joanne Molenski, who quickly became Hunter's new beat partner. However, actress Darlanne Fluegel was unable to get along with series star Fred Dryer or others on the show's staff, and she soon resigned less than three months into the 1990-1991 season. It was decided the new girl — Molenski — would be murdered by a serial killer.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JustShootMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JustShootMe">Just Shoot Me!</a></em> had Vicki Costa, a brash hairdresser whom Jack brought in to help make the magazine hipper. Everyone else's story lines were sidetracked to revolve around her — Jack immediately respects her, Elliot immediately falls for her, Nina feels threatened by her, Finch thinks she's really hot, and Maya is obsessed with getting Vikki to open up to her. All the while, Vikki's too cool to really participate in the plot and usually has to be pursued by the other characters. It's been suggested by somewhat dubious sources that forcing her character into the cast was an aggressive attempt by executives to give Rena Sofer a star vehicle. Ratings plummeted after her introduction, she barely lasted half a season, and they didn't even air her farewell episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: SVU</a></em> added Kim Greylek in Season 10 to replace the disbarred Casey Novak. Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">Informed Ability</a> and cold demeanor didn't win over fans so after 15 episodes she was quickly booted and replaced with the returning Alex Cabot.
</li><li> Nikki and Paulo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> were suddenly introduced in the third season as regular characters. The idea was to shine a light on what was happening with some of the other survivors who were not main characters. The characters were written to be somewhat unsympathetic at first to give them an arc, much like many of the other main characters. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">fans didn't like the new characters</a>, nor the artificiality of their sudden inclusion. Luckily, the writers had sensed the incoming backlash and "scrapped" the idea, choosing to give them a gruesome death in a single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFocus">character-centric</a> episode. Happy now, Losties?
</li><li> Nikki Carpenter from season 3 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MacGyver1985" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MacGyver1985">MacGyver</a></em>. She was written as a potential love interest for the title character, only for the producers to discover that female fans did not want Mac to have a regular girlfriend. About halfway through the season, she is mentioned as being on assignment in South America and is then never heard from again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren">Married... with Children</a></em> had Seven, a little boy who was adopted by the Bundys. Seven was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">forced on the show by Fox execs</a>, who saw how popular the cute kids <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse">on other sitcoms of the time</a> were and decided that's what the Bundys needed (even though their ratings were just fine.) Fox hyped the kid's arrival to no end, but Seven was resoundingly hated by fans and writers alike. The main problem was that the writers couldn't do anything with him: the show's humor came from mercilessly abusing the characters, but that wouldn't work with a little kid. So Seven just kind of stood around in the background doing nothing when he wasn't serving as a <em>source</em> of abuse for the other characters — with Peggy doting on him endlessly — meaning he was either a nonentity or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">The Scrappy</a>. After half a season of this, the writers removed him from the show entirely. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOnAMilkCarton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOnAMilkCarton">His picture shows up on a milk carton</a> a few episodes later, as both a quick gag and an explanation for his absence.

<ul><li> An odd example from the first episode of season two. A new knight called "Sir Geraint" in the credits was introduced, who seemed to function as Arthur's second-in-command and was given several promotional shots.

</li><li> Agravaine is a scarily accurate portrayal of this trope, so much so that it's as if the writers deliberately ticked off all the prerequisites listed at the top of the page.

For those keeping count, this was all in the space of three appearances. While the writers had more in mind for him, actor Duncan Regehr's other work commitments ultimately put a halt to this plan, and though his only having made three appearances meant the producers could probably have gotten away with recasting him, fan reaction to the character was ultimately too indifferent to justify this, and they instead decided to develop Odo's unrequited feelings towards Kira into something more substantial.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWannabe">Jo Harvelle</a> in Season 2 was promoted as Dean's first recurring love interest (in fact, the first recurring love interest on the show in general), and even received three clear storylines of her own (becoming a hunter, finding out the truth about her father's death, and tracking down her MIA boyfriend Rick, who only appeared on a hidden feature on the Season 1 DVD). Instead of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">"the Leia" to Sam 'n' Dean's Luke and Han Solo</a> as promised, Jo got dropped like a hot potato with only four episodes under her belt (two of which were basically just cameos). Her final appearance in the season was as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">disillusioned</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a> terrorized by a demon <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">possessing Sam</span>. The demon gave her an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakThemByTalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakThemByTalking">earful on how Dean doesn't think of her either as a fellow hunter or as a potential girlfriend</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatScrappy">that was ripped right from the online forums</a>, made her describe her dad's death to it and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldYouLikeToHearHowTheyDied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldYouLikeToHearHowTheyDied">taunted her with a much more gruesome and disturbing version</a> of how it <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateLiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateLiar">said</a></em> it went down, and it was implied to be about to rape and torture her to death <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">when Dean arrived</a>. Jo then saw first-hand that Dean would have let her die <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">rather than kill his possessed brother</span>, and she was left dejectedly muttering, "No, you won't," when he said he'd call her. That's a pretty freakin' harsh way to satiate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip">the fandom's bloodthirsty hatred</a>, <em>Supernatural</em> writers. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She eventually returned in Season 5, but only for a mere two episodes before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice">she dies in a terribly sad way</a>.</span>
</li><li> Something similar happened with Bela Talbot. She was a thief out to exploit the supernatural to her benefit, able to either help or hinder the Winchesters as the story needed, and acted as another potential love interest for Dean (as Ruby, who was tied to Sam's story, was introduced around the same point in time, with both actresses placed in the 'starring' portion of the credits). However, her second appearance was the episode "Red Sky At Morning," which was not well received by both fans and the writers (there was even a later in-universe apology for the episode as being 'bad writing'), and her next two appearances had her first give a bad guy the location of the Winchesters, then help the Winchesters out only so she could get close and steal the Colt, the only weapon they had that could kill demons. Oh, and then she appeared in one more episode and got them arrested. There might have still been a chance for her had she appeared in more episodes in a less antagonistic way, but this was the season of the Writer's Strike, and with fan reaction being made clear over the course of the strike, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she was killed off in the penultimate episode of the season in an even more tragic way than Jo</span>.
</li><li> Anna Milton, Dean's third would-be love interest, also fits the bill. She wasn't really <em>disliked</em> by the fans — well, other than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip">shippers</a>, of course — but she had the bad luck of being introduced a few episodes after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Castiel</a>. The original idea was that Castiel would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a> after only a few episodes of screentime, and then Anna would take his place as Dean's angel guide. However, by the time Anna made her first appearance, Castiel was already so loved by the fans that the writers didn't dare get rid of him. Instead, they decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter">make him a major character and expand his role in the series</a>, and this meant a lot of material originally intended for Anna went to Castiel instead. Initially they tried to keep Anna around too, but this didn't work too well, so eventually they decided to write her out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by having her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerailingLoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerailingLoveInterests">randomly turn evil and try to kill Sam</a></span>.
</li><li> Amelia in Season 8 is yet another example. The intention was for her and Sam to have a beautiful, tragic romance together that would eventually force Sam to choose between a perfect life with her, or give up that life to help Dean save the world. What actually happened is that fans couldn't figure out why Sam was wasting his time with this random woman instead of helping Dean get out of Purgatory or trying to save the prophet Kevin from Crowley. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">Epileptic Trees</a> abounded that she was some sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoneyTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoneyTrap">Honey Trap</a> sent to divert Sam from some greater purpose, until it was eventually confirmed otherwise. The whole arc came off as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedByMountainLions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedByMountainLions">Trapped by Mountain Lions</a> plot, and Sam <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass">Took a Level in Jerkass</a> to get it to work. Eventually, the writers realized how badly Amelia had misfired and quietly wrote her out halfway through the season. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is she won't be coming back.
</li></ul></li><li> Randy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow">That '70s Show</a></em> became a replacement for Eric and Kelso in the last season, gaining a permanent role in the group and quickly becoming Donna's new love interest. However, the fans couldn't stand him, so he only shows up in one brief scene at the beginning of the series finale, and doesn't appear in the final Circle at the end.

Although a promising actor, Halyalkar had problems meshing with the cast (according to Katherine Helmond in a series retrospective that aired on E!), plus he came off as annoying to audiences. By the end of the season, Billy's grandmother had miraculously recovered so he went to live with her. After the one line explaining his absence, he was never mentioned again.

Came in with lots of history (he was, after all, Diesel back in the early '90s, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleetingDemographicRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleetingDemographicRule">wrestling fans aren't supposed to remember that</a>) and an infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> friendship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels">Shawn Michaels</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottHall">Scott Hall</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SeanWaltman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SeanWaltman">X-Pac</a> (his teammates in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewWorldOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewWorldOrder">nWo</a>). His presence seemed to leave a bad taste in a lot of fans' mouths, and after his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury">second quad tear</a>, he left for another several years. Why Hall and X-Pac didn't get the same treatment is anyone's guess. Nash's nickname of "Big Poochie" actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">dates back to</a> late-90s WCW, where he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningTheAsylum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningTheAsylum">Head Booker</a> and essentially forcing <em>Nitro</em> to revolve around himself, with increasingly absurd segments that seemed to be aired purely for the amusement of Nash himself.
</li><li> This is actually fairly common in wrestling. Whenever a wrestler debuts and is immediately hated by the fans, promotions will usually either retool him with a different gimmick, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">put him on a bus.</a> An example would be Beaver Cleavage, who was heavily hyped by the WWE prior to his debut and lasted all of a week before becoming Chaz.
<ul><li> A more recent example was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SinnBodhi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SinnBodhi">Kizarny</a>. The gimmick was that he was apparently a carnival/circus performer so he always spoke in Carny. Carny is a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PigLatin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PigLatin">Pig Latin</a> commonly used by carnival folks and wrestlers, where you put "iz" before the first (or maybe all) vowels of a word. This, of course, made nearly everything the guy said unintelligible and the character was dropped before he could even debut save for one match against MVP.
</li><li> In 80's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWF</a> a lot of vignettes were filmed hyping a wrestler named Outback Jack. This was basically Vince's attempt to cash in on the success of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CrocodileDundee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CrocodileDundee">Crocodile Dundee</a></em>. After months and months of hype, fans were treated to some of the worst "wrestling" ever performed in public. Jack was shown the door in short order.
</li><li> ECW and WCW tag team <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ThePublicEnemyWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ThePublicEnemyWrestling">The Public Enemy</a> was brought into the WWF as a favor to there-for-a-cup-of-coffee-himself booker Terry Taylor in 1999. They managed to irritate both the fans and wrestlers in short order, and found their way out of the company after being legitimately beaten up during a match.
</li></ul></li><li> The most infamous example though, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheGobbledyGooker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheGobbledyGooker">The Gobbledy Gooker</a>. He had all of one appearance (not even a <em>match</em>, just a ten minute long skit with Mean Gene Okerlund) before he was never mentioned again, save for a gimmick battle royale at Wrestlemania X-7. He does get referenced by WWE every now and then, albeit only to point out how horrible he was. He's also got a page on WWE.com in the "WWE Alumni" section of the roster.
</li><li> Similarly there was "The Shockmaster", intended as a new persona for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FredOttman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FredOttman">Fred Ottman</a>. Even by wrestling standards, his costume was fairly ridiculous, consisting of an oversized black leather vest paired with a glitter-covered Stormtrooper helmet, but the character's initial introduction was so disastrous as to make the character completely unsalvageable. In his first interview he was blasted through a prop wall by his own pyro, tripped over a piece of wood, fell over and lost his helmet, making it quite clear that it was Ottman under the helmet (despite Ole Anderson providing voiceover audio). The other wrestlers were visibly trying not to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Corpsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Corpsing">burst out into laughter</a> (With Davey Boy Smith loudly exclaiming "He fell on his arse! He fell flat on his fookin arse!") and the announcers met the entire event with stunned silence (save for Jesse "The Body" Ventura, who shouted "What an impressive entrance by the Shockmaster!" while trying desperately not to laugh his ass off). Even trying to bring Ottman back as "The Super Shockmaster", who was changed to be a deliberately bumbling comic relief met with lukewarm reception. In very short order Ottman simply started wrestling as "Typhoon", and Shockmaster is only brought up as an in-joke for longtime wrestling fans.
</li><li> Former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWENXT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWENXT">WWE NXT</a> winner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LowKi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LowKi">Kaval</a> spent two months being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a> and then asked for his release. This contrasts to his fellow NXT winners, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WadeBarrett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WadeBarrett">Wade Barrett</a> leading the Nexus stable through out most of 2010, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kaitlyn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kaitlyn">Kaitlyn</a> getting a notable Divas Championship reign and Johnny Curtis becoming a viral hit with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Fandango" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Fandango">Fandango</a> gimmick.

Instead, other players were tired of so many Captain Ersatz characters in the RPG, and the last thing they wanted was another group of Ersatzes based on a show they did not watch introduced at the last minute and expected to share the spotlight with the main cast. As a result, Atton Rand quickly shooed out the <em>Buffy</em> Ersatzes, and they were never mentioned again.

However, Darius, Jekyll, and Mephistopheles, the iconic Berserker, Assassin, and Caster, never really caught on due to their unimpressive gameplay performance and lackluster characterization. This led to them being phased out of the game fairly quickly; though they still pop up in the gacha rolls, you'd struggle to find an appearance by any of them after the game's first year.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>:
<ul><li> Due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange">fishing levels</a> in his debut game and his slowgoing, dopey personality, Big the Cat has mostly been relegated to goofy cameos. Harmless stuff, right? Continued aggression towards the character despite not having any relevant role in a main series title in years led to his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2">Sonic Adventure 2</a></em> cameos being pointlessly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> of the GCN re-release (most of them return in the XBLA/PSN/Steam re-release), a cameo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations">Sonic Generations</a></em> being cut and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonicTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonicTeam">Sonic Team</a> heads <em>apologizing for bringing him in</em> during a Q&amp;A at the Summer of Sonic fan convention. He was eventually brought back for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamSonicRacing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamSonicRacing">Team Sonic Racing</a></em>.
</li><li> After Silver's debut in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006">Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)</a></em> and prominent role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicRivals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicRivals">Sonic Rivals</a> 2</em>, he's been demoted to extremely minor roles.
</li><li> Princess Elise, who also debuted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006">Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)</a></em>, is a much straighter example. During the sneak peeks of <em>Sonic 06</em>, she was heavily hyped up, especially with the addition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaceyChabert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaceyChabert">Lacey Chabert</a> as her VA. When the game was released, she quickly became the most hated character in the franchise because she is constantly kidnapped and developed a disturbing attraction toward Sonic, up to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kissing Sonic's <em>corpse</em> to revive him in the Last Story</span>.
</li><li> Most of the characters introduced between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure">Sonic Adventure</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed">Sonic Unleashed</a></em> have been demoted to very short appearances in recent Sonic games due to the re-emphasis on Sonic being the only mandatory playable character. Recent titles have Tails as the other only companion to Sonic.
</li><li> Even after re-introducing other characters to the games, Sonic Team is still adamant about having Sonic be the only playable character until they've perfected the Sonic formula. Although they do seem to be trying to ease other characters back in and will presumably make them playable in a later game.
</li></ul></li><li> Many fans viewed Jun Kazama's omission from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken">Tekken</a> 3</em> and onwards in this manner, as she didn't have a replacement, unlike the other missing characters from <em>Tekken 2</em>. Whilst she appeared in the non-canon <em>Tekken Tag Tournament</em>, it took until <em>Tekken 5</em> for her replacement Asuka to come in, who wasn't quite the same. Fans got quite vitriolic for Jun to return in <em>Tekken Tag 2</em>, which she did, and was significantly improved from her original form. Jun was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> largely to add weight to her son Jin's story.

Outside of that, the story was widely seen as the worst part of the game (a good portion of it thanks to Patroklos, again). This <em>did not take</em> with fans <strong>at all</strong>, and Project Soul/Namco caught on (especially after the man responsible for all of it, Daishi Odashima, quit the team) and hit the reset button the relief of just about everyone. The plan going forward is to focus on the most iconic core cast, and it doesn't sound likely the series will ever return to the <em>V</em> era anytime soon.

Either out of mercy to the audience or simply because her jokes had run their course, the creators eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">kill her off</a> by way of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeContinuedRightNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeContinuedRightNow">instantly-resolved</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TonightSomeoneDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TonightSomeoneDies">Tonight, Someone Dies</a> faux-cliffhanger where her death is little more than just a footnote, and restore Mr. Garrison to his previous post. That and they might as well fulfill her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">prophetic name</a>.

</li><li> In his first appearance, Towelie appears to be a parody of this trope. He appears out of absolutely nowhere, the boys react just enough to get him to wander off periodically, and the episode features a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodyCommercial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodyCommercial">Parody Commercial</a> for Towelie merchandise (including, just in case, "I hate Towelie" T-shirts). That said, he has reappeared, if only rarely.
<div class="indent"><strong>Cartman:</strong> Towelie, you're the worst character ever. <br/><strong>Towelie:</strong> I <em>know</em>.
</div></li></ul></li><li> Parodied in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyAndTheBrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyAndTheBrain">Pinky and the Brain</a></em>, with Larry, who got an awkward <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles">Promotion to Opening Titles</a>, and generated a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool">Retool</a> into a knock-off of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges">The Three Stooges</a></em>. And plenty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg">My Friends... and Zoidberg</a> moments. In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a>, he left specifically <em>because</em> Brain pointed out that he didn't gel. Then, at the very end, just as it looked like that Pinky and the Brain will carry on as a duo again, a scientist placed another mouse into their cage, and the mouse introduces himself as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarxBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarxBrothers">Zeppo</a>. The ending reprise of the theme song was then reworked to have Zeppo's name in it in the same manner as Larry. He's gone before the next episode, though. The entire episode, similar to the <em>Simpsons</em> example above, was made in response to the network asking them to add in a third character and make Pinky and the Brain a trio. The episode staved off their demands for a while, but the network eventually got their way, inserting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Elmyra Duff</a> into the show, and turning it into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyElmyraAndTheBrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyElmyraAndTheBrain">Pinky, Elmyra &amp; the Brain</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunners">It was canned after five episodes aired</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em> cartoon show averts this trope by the fact that most of the Smurfs are basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessMasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessMasses">Faceless Masses</a>, identical to each other. A character can be brought in, given prominence for a while, and then be easily written out with no problem and without anybody really missing them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em>, Adrena Lynn was meant to be a recurring rival and foil for Kim. The fans disliked her — and, more to the point, far preferred Shego - leaving her as one of the very, very few villains with only one episode (and a cameo in the finale).
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePonyGeneration4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePonyGeneration4">My Little Pony Generation 4</a></em> spinoff <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirls">Equestria Girls</a></em> introduced Flash Sentry as a potential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a> for main character Twilight Sparkle. The movie had a prominent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> about the two of them constantly bumping into each other, the two develop a visible mutual crush on one another, and the movie even ends with Twilight bumping into her world's Flash Sentry. However, his character gathered quite the backlash from many fans, due to both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteLoveInterest">blandness of his character</a> and that he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DryDocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DryDocking">a love interest for Twilight at all</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3ycz5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3ycz5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3ycz5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenFaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenFaust">Lauren Faust</a> specifically stated that she had a hard rule with having no romance involving the mane six in an interview, and many fans still believe the current writers should adhere to that even after her departure</span>. Because of this, he received much less screentime in the succeeding films; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> was dropped altogether, he spends most of <em>Rainbow Rocks</em> being under the influence of the Dazzlings' strife-causing spell, and come <em>Friendship Games</em>, he gets barely any lines to speak of and he gets handily rejected by the Human Twilight. He does get a subplot in <em>Legend of Everfree</em>, in which Sunset Shimmer tells him that he should get over human Twilight, which ends up with Flash thinking about hooking up with Sunset again. As for pony Flash, he has all but disappeared beyond all of two season 4 cameos, one of which lightly referenced their mutual crush.
</li><li> Sparky from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em> was reported to not be returning in Season 10 because of his huge unpopularity among fans, critics, and even staff members.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow">Regular Show</a></em> seems to have done this with Thomas (or Nikolai). He was introduced in a special and afterwards undergoes a rite of passage in the form of several of Muscleman's pranks. Afterwards, his screentime dwindled. His unimportant status is even further reinforced by the fact that we don't get to hear a story from him during the one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalloweenEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalloweenEpisode">Halloween Episode</a> in which he was present beyond a cliche <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanedPunchline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanedPunchline">Orphaned Punchline</a>. He leaves the cast in a plot that makes little to no sense even for this show.
