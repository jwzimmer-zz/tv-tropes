The characters might as well not even attempt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade">The Masquerade</a>, because all the civilians around them know who they are and what they are up to. And that super-secret bit of gossip that no one can ever know? Hate to tell you this, but <em>everyone knows it already</em>. But at the core of the trope, is the fact that even though everyone is fully aware everyone else knows about the secret, it will still be treated as a secret; no one will ever openly admit to knowing it, and it is a common understanding that it should remain unspoken. Sometimes the occasional knowingly wink and nod will be shared, at most vague allusions or euphemisms might be used, but any and all open discussion and acknowledgment of the secret is completely out of the question. To do so will be viewed a mild faux pas at best, and an outright cardinal sin at worst. As a result, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveNewcomer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveNewcomer">Naïve Newcomer</a> or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater">Fish out of Water</a> will often mistake it for an actual secret, as they don't know that most people already know. In smaller social circles, a common variant is "everyone knows, but they don't know how many other people know until they start comparing notes one day", at which point the real secret is that it isn't one.

<div class="indent"><strong>Takumi:</strong> Oh, if only there was a ninja protector who could save us! <br/><strong>Akira:</strong> <em>[rolls eyes]</em> I'm going for a walk. <br/><em>[Takumi happily smiles]</em>
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beastars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beastars">Beastars</a></em>: The Back-Alley Market, a market on the edge of town where people can buy and sell meat. Everybody in the town knows about it, and most carnivores use it, however, everybody collectively acts as if they knew nothing about it, with the exception being carnivores talking with each other, and Sebun mentions that a carnivore telling her about the market is something she never experienced, and everybody just pretends that the enforcing of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianCarnivore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianCarnivore">Vegetarian Carnivore</a> rules are working. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Louis attempting to bring up the subject in live broadcast apparently breaks general rules of what the town's media can talk.</span>
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolRumble">School Rumble</a></em> manga, Yakumo's friends clumsily prepare her a surprise birthday party and she spends the rest of the day pretending she doesn't know. She comes home to find Tenma also preparing her a party.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, it seems that Ed has "I performed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">a human transmutation</a>" written on his shirt. Most alchemists he meets figure it out within an episode. While his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs">automail arm and leg</a> aren't much of a clue (lots of people have automail, and it's implied that some people even replace fully functional limbs with it), the fact that his brother is a suit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedArmor">Animated Armor</a> tends to be a dead give-away that they have crossed a line never meant to be crossed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Acca13TerritoryInspectionDept" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Acca13TerritoryInspectionDept">ACCA: 13-Territory Inspection Dept.</a></em>, as of episode 7, the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jean is of royal blood</span> was so secret even he didn't know it. When the characters discuss this, they talk in hushed voices and try not to let it get out. Yet, by episode 10, everyone seems to know, including the Acca employee who meets Jean when he comes to audit that incredibly secluded desert district.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Aruosumente" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Aruosumente">Aruosumente</a></em>:
<ul><li> The more the story progresses, the more it looks like <em>everyone</em> knows what happened ten years ago — except Legna, whom everyone does their utmost best to keep in the dark. Some assume he also knows already, but the Senate especially are hell-bent on keeping the truth from him.
</li><li> The fact that His Majesty often comes to the laboratory to enjoy himself while inventing or just talking to Jasmin or Lante seems to be an open secret everyone keeps from Legna as Legna has a reputation as a joy killer.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu">To Love-Ru</a></em>, the fact that Lala is an alien is treated like this for quite a while, as everyone either already knows, or doesn't care when they find out.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> a law exists that forbids anyone revealing that the titular character is the vessel of the Nine-Tailed Fox. While this means that Naruto's generation and those younger are ignorant of the Nine-Tails, every person able to remember the attack knows about it. The secret becomes even more open in <em>Shippuden</em> where several members of Naruto's generation openly discuss the matter. As of the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Fourth Ninja World War</span> it is officially not a secret anymore. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Part of the coalition's main objectives is to protect Naruto (and Killer Bee)</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em>, Quattro's real identity as Char. Not only would the audience not be fooled (the same character design, the visible scar, the same voice actor) but the fact that he flies around in a custom red Rick Dias shows that he isn't exactly keeping a low profile. It even gets lampshaded when he officially reveals his identity
<div class="indent"><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Kamille</a>:</strong> Hmph. Some <strong>secret</strong>...

Iason even admits everyone knows because of his brazen special treatment of Riki.

</li><li> The use of Nen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em>, the setting's effective magic system, is supposedly a secret known only to people who belong to circles that are in on it and seem to be subtly taught to hunters once they pass the Hunter Exams. However, it is also openly publicized in an arena tower that not only seems to televise the fights between powerful Nen users, also have commentators explaining what the contestants are doing in the Arena with their Nen to a large public. It gets to a point that the only main character that should realistically be ignorant about Nen is Gon, for growing up on an isolated and morose island in the middle of nowhere. Killua should know about Nen just by osmosis from his heavy Nen-practicing family of world-famous assassins, Kurapika's deceased clan is implied to be formed of powerful Nen users as well (otherwise they wouldn't register on Nobunaga's memory. Even Uvo eventually remembers the clan and its powerful members) and Leorio's general world and history knowledge should make him aware of it as well (even if just by passing knowledge about the Celestial Arena).
</li><li> The fact that Akina's an otaku is an open secret among her classmates in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShinozakisanKiWoOtaShikaNi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShinozakisanKiWoOtaShikaNi">Don't Become an Otaku, Shinozaki-san!</a></em>. She thinks she keeps it hidden but everyone in her class is well aware, as shown when several girls try to awkwardly strike up a conversation with her but back off because they aren't sure how to talk to an otaku. Akina's old middle school <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlPosse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlPosse">Girl Posse</a> are also quick to realize that she has a major crush on Kaede, another thing Akina thinks she's hidden.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Metropolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Metropolis">Metropolis</a></em>: Everybody knows that Rock is Duke Red's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Dragon</a>, even though there are no official links between the two. Pero even name-drops this trope when discussing it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UQHolder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UQHolder">UQ Holder!</a></em>, Kuromaru does his best to hide the fact that he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBiologicalSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBiologicalSex">No Biological Sex</a>, but he doesn't exactly do a good job of hiding it. Furthermore, it's implied that the fact is listed in his UQ Holder file and isn't that difficult to access. Basically, the only person who isn't aware of the fact is Touta.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>: As revealed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/StrikersSoundStageX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/StrikersSoundStageX">StrikerS Sound Stage X</a></em> when Runessa tried to access certain information, most of the details behind the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers">Jail Scaglietti incident</a> are a military secret, including the fact that Vivio is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloneJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloneJesus">clone of the last Sankt Kaiser</a>. Or at least, it would be, if not for the fact that Vivio's a friendly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheerfulChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheerfulChild">Cheerful Child</a> and the fact that said revelation is important to a lot of powerful groups. This meant that most of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaVivid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaVivid">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha ViVid</a></em> cast knows of Vivio's unique situation, which includes Vivio's civilian friends, all the members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaintlyChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaintlyChurch">Saint Church</a>, and practically every major competitor in the Inter-Middle that we know of. It isn't until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VividStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VividStrike">ViVid Strike!</a></em> that we get an idea of how little information about Vivio is available to the general public, as an attempt by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpposingSportsTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpposingSportsTeam">Rinne's gym</a> to research her brought back nothing about her Sankt Kaiser heritage.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HighSchoolInariTamamoChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HighSchoolInariTamamoChan">High School Inari Tamamo-chan!</a></em>, Tamamo Fushimi is a high school girl who is secretly a fox spirit from the Fushimi Inari shrine in Kyoto. What she doesn't seem to realize is that though she appears to be an ordinary human to adults and cameras, her fellow students can see right through her disguise.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MonthlyGirlsNozakiKun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MonthlyGirlsNozakiKun">Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun</a></em>: The assistants try to keep the fact that they are working for Nozaki a secret, sometimes even from each other. Nozaki himself does not hide the fact that he is the shoujo mangaka Yumeno nor does he think that his assistants should keep their affiliations with him a secret. He is actually very open about his profession, but the majority of his classmates do not believe him.
</li><li> In early volumes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>, Ranma tries to keep secret the fact that he transforms into a girl when doused with cold water, mostly from his fellow students at school. (His father and the Tendos know all about it.) At some point, the secret just disappears, and everyone knows about it and doesn't care much. (Except for the particularly oblivious and denial-worthy. Looking at you, Kunou.)

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>'s secret identity is like this sometimes, especially in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Marvel</a>. In one issue, Daredevil (not in costume, of course) walked up to him, at school, to recruit him for a mission. In another issue, the Human Torch and Iceman showed up at school mostly because they were bored (Iceman: "Hey, aren't you—" Peter: "Don't you dare."). And finally, Kong — a jock who deduced it on his own — tells Peter to go help a friend, and when Peter looks ambivalent, he mocks him. "What do you want me to say? Should we have a code? Should I just throw up my hands and say 'Oh, if only Spider-Man were here...'!?" This was lampshaded, parodied and subverted in one issue when he's knocked unconscious and wakes up in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen">X-Mansion</a> without his mask (they wanted to make sure he was OK); upon learning this, Peter engages in a very long rant about how he's trying to keep a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a> here and is getting a bit sick of everyone somehow knowing that he's Peter Parker... only for them to point out that while they knew what he looked like, until <em>now</em> they didn't know <em>his name</em>. Oops.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Green Arrow</a>'s "secret identity" as Oliver Queen. Between his not-particularly-concealing mask and incredibly distinctive facial hair, anyone who's met them both will know that it's him. It doesn't help that Green Arrow is one of the more politically outspoken heroes, which means even his stated philosophies line up with Oliver's. In one case a policeman working with Green Arrow came to his house and, on being asked how he knew his identity, hadn't even known it was supposed to be a secret. His to-be sidekick Mia also recognized him instantly, not least because he was claiming to be a good friend of the Green Arrow. The best he could hope for is people thinking he's got a twin.
</li><li> In his own book, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a></em>, Patch is actively concealing the fact that he is, in fact, the title superhero while he is operating in "deep cover" in Madripoor. Of course, all of his contacts know he is Wolverine, though they chose not to reveal this. They figured it is best not to delve too deeply into the private affairs of a walking blender. Not to mention the fact that the "Patch" persona adopted by Wolverine is SUCH a good disguise that apparently all Wolverine needs for this is, you guessed it, an eyepatch. Clearly, NO-ONE (I'm looking at you, Superman) can figure out his identity, save pretty much everyone.
</li><li> When the Human Torch of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em>, a character whom the in-universe public knows as Johnny Storm, got his own ongoing feature in <em>Strange Tales</em> starting in issue #101, he maintained a secret identity in his home town of Glenville — the inhabitants of which knew his sister Sue was the Invisible Girl, but ostensibly don't know who the Torch was (the four schoolmates who do know who he is are now out-of-town graduates who were sworn to secrecy). #106 had him discover that everyone knew who he really is, after all, they just respected his privacy.
</li><li> One story in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity">Astro City</a></em> centered partly around a country superhero called Roustabout. It was blatantly obvious that he was one of the guys working for a traveling fair, and everybody in town knew it but acted as if it was a complete mystery. They do this because Roustabout is technically a fugitive (he got his powers trespassing on the secret research lab of an evil corporation, and they offered a reward for his arrest) and they like and respect him too much to turn him in. The viewpoint character of the story, a city girl staying with her aunt, considers turning him in, but then realizes something else about him: given that everyone in town knows who he is and haven't done so, what would they do to someone who <em>did</em> try to turn him in?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a></em>: During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis">Brian Michael Bendis</a>' run, Matt Murdock's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a> was outed. Although the accusation was "officially" fought back, since then <em>everyone</em> knows or at least heavily suspects Matt Murdock is Daredevil, so much so that he had to cease practicing law himself due to the fodder it supplied the opposing counsel. By the time of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkWaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkWaid">Mark Waid</a>'s run, even Matt himself has stopped caring and he just waves off people saying he's Daredevil with a halfhearted "I'm not Daredevil" that nobody buys. He still can't represent anyone, so he gives legal counsel to people so they can represent themselves.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGwen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGwen">Spider-Gwen</a> was originally just a marketing nickname, as she was known as Spider-Woman in her own reality. Later, her secret identity is outed, and she spends a year in jail. Upon release, she discovers that Spider-Gwen merchandise exists — she's stuck with the name. Any attempt to correct people fails, prompting her to decide she needs a new name. During Spider-Geddon, Miles Morales, thinking she'd been killed, asked if she was a ghost. This inspired her name codename, Ghost-Spider, though the name is pretty much redundant with her secret identity no longer a secret.
</li><li> In comics where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman">Batman</a> is treated as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend">Urban Legend</a>, his existence is often this. There's a giant spotlight that gets shined in the sky, major criminals find their way into police hands, many people have seen him, you can see people wearing Batman costumes and merch, and pretty much every superhero has either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity">worked with him or worked with someone who's worked with him</a>. This sometimes gets some mocking, such as in <em>Young Justice</em>, where Robin keeps trying to "hide in the shadows" in broad daylight while insisting he's a myth.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a>'s nature as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman">Superman</a>'s most notorious rival falls into this, in stories leaning on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> aspect. Pretty much everyone knows that Luthor dislikes Superman, and that any military contract he gets will go haywire and target Superman, and that he's publicly battled Superman a time or two while "under mind control", and that Superman himself has spoken poorly of Luthor, but Luthor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">manages to cover his tracks just enough to save himself in criminal court</a>. One of the comics leading into Luthor's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil">President Evil</a> run had Luthor go into a restaurant and find that the menu included a number of Superman-based items and one incredibly disgusting Luthor one.

There's also a number of senators that were aware of it before it went public, even if some misunderstood the exact details (Riyo Chuchi was under the impression that Obi-Wan and/or Ahsoka were also part of the relationship, something that would have been perfectly normal on her homeworld).

Nobody wants to come right out and say it, because Lancelot is "the best knight that is on life" and would challenge anyone who dared bring it up to trial by combat, in which he would slaughter them. That no one dares do more than hinting about it obliquely allows King Arthur to officially pretend he doesn't know about it for quite some time. In the fourth book <em>Candle in the Wind</em>, Mordred's scheming finally makes it impossible for Arthur to keep up the charade and he has to officially charge Lancelot and Guenevere with High Treason in the new courts, ironically set up by Arthur himself because he didn't like how trial by combat meant the person who could afford to hire the biggest, strongest fighter as a champion got to basically do whatever he wanted.

One particularly notable example is Reid's drug problem in Season 2. He meets a friend outside the group who figures out what's going on in about fifteen seconds. When Reid says that he hasn't told anyone about it, the friend's response is along the lines of "Okay, I'm a jazz musician who hasn't seen you in ten years.

<ul><li> Lord Renly and Ser Loras' relationship is theoretically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretRelationship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretRelationship">secret</a> given that the setting is based on the middle ages where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">homosexuality wasn't exactly approved of</a>, but not only does nearly the whole court, (including Renly's wife Margaery Tyrell) know about it, even a couple of random Lannister soldiers halfway across Westeros from them were joking about Loras "stabbing Renly Baratheon for years, and Renly ain't dead!" in one episode. Considering that Renly's marriage to Margaery was never officially consumated and Loras is often seen entering his tent at nighttime, they really shouldn't have been surprised. This continues even after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Renly's death</span>. It's revealed in Season 3 that Jaime, Cersei, Joffrey, Tywin, and Tyrion are also aware of Renly's sexual orientation. The Tyrells are a very powerful family that can easily shift the balance of power in the kingdom, so anyone with any political savvy avoids discussing Loras Tyrell's sexual preferences. Joffrey makes a massive political faux pas when he publicly brings up Renly's homosexuality. Everyone knows about it, but only someone as thoughtless as Joffrey would bring it up in the presence of the Tyrells.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jaime:</strong> It's all true about Renly. His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court. It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks... They'd have never got him off it.
</div></li><li> On the same token, much of the nobility of Westeros seems to be aware, or at the very least <em>suspicious,</em> that Queen Cersei is having an affair with her twin brother, and that her children are illegitimate bastards born from the incest. Except for King Robert and the twins' father Lord Tywin, all of the smarter members of the court  Varys, Littlefinger, and Pycelle  have for a long time known for sure but kept it to themselves for their own plots and benefit. However, few people are actually willing to directly challenge Cersei on the matter because of her political allies. Ned Stark learns this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedMoralVictor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedMoralVictor">the hard way</a>. Stannis Baratheon "outs" their secret when he receives Ned's missive, and it quickly catches <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfMouth">Word Of Mouth</a> with the commonfolk at King's Landing and different parts of the kingdom, though whether people believed it is another matter. Olenna Tyrell, who's marrying her granddaughter to the Crown, points out to Tywin Lannister that the evidence is very convincing. As of "A Man Without Honour" in the second season, even Jaime and Cersei have given up denying it. As Season 4 rolls, it is the worst kept secret of Westeros and is only tolerated for political necessity and convenience, with everyone making snarky comments about it and the rumor having spread all the way across the Narrow Sea to Essos. Only Tywin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness">refuses to acknowledge the truth even to himself</a>, and his denial is suggested to be because he point blank <em>does not want to believe it</em> since it would mean that his whole legacy and the Lannister blood claim to the throne is built on a lie. Even when Cersei herself tells Tywin outright that it's true, he refuses to believe it.
</li><li> Lampshaded in season 8 when the truth about Jon's parentage gets around. When Varys is told and learns that he's the <em>eighth</em> to know, he remarks that at that point it's not really a keepable secret anymore and will soon be common knowledge.

While it certainly isn't true that everyone in the city knows that Bruce is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/BatmanTheCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/BatmanTheCharacter">Batman</a>, more people than usual seem to have guessed his secret, but have just chosen not to say anything. Justified, since the entire series except the finale is a Batman prequel show, and some of the plot revolves around different comic characters befriending Bruce over a decade before he ever puts on the mask, so they might know him better than they do in the comics. It becomes apparent by the end of the finale that Jim Gordon has guessed the new vigilante's identity, and that Harvey Bullock might be close to finding out. Remarkably, two villains also correctly guess Batman's identity, but neither seem inclined to say anything, most likely because they both actually like Bruce, and used to be his friends. Selina Kyle/Catwoman doesn't even need to see Bruce's face to realize who the mysterious vigilante stalking her is, and it takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheJoker">the Joker</a> all of a second to recognize Bruce under the mask when he encounters Batman for the first time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">even though part of Bruce's face is covered, he hasn't seen him for ten years, and he's standing about fifty feet away from him.</a>

Phyllis catches her and Dwight together in the office (right after Andy proposed to Angela and she said yes) and blackmails Angela into letting her head the party committee. Phyllis eventually tells anyway and everyone at the office knows but Andy. This leads to an awkward moment when Andy serenades Angela on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">a sitar</a> and declares that he will love her for the rest of his life, and everyone in the office stares at them.

Given that Smallville has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">a rather high population of metahumans</a>, this isn't hard to pass off.

Construction had already begun in September 2001, and everyone already knew what the ride was going to be because of the September 21, 2001 edition of the <em>Orange County Register</em>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2y3gi');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2y3gi" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2y3gi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The ride was rethemed in 2017 to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/GuardiansOfTheGalaxyMissionBreakout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/GuardiansOfTheGalaxyMissionBreakout">Guardians of the Galaxy  Mission: BREAKOUT!</a></em></span>

In May of 1965, though, rumors began circulating that Disney was building an "East Coast" version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/Disneyland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/Disneyland">Disneyland</a>. However, the <em>Orlando Sentinel</em> denied the rumors' accuracy based on an earlier interview with Walt Disney at the Kennedy Space Center, in which he claimed a $50 million investment was in the works for Disneyland, and that he had no interest in building a new park.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3876f');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3876f" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3876f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Disneyland received a makeover to Tomorrowland around this time</span> In October 1965, editor Emily Bavar from the <em>Sentinel</em> visited Disneyland during the park's tenth anniversary celebration. In an interview with Disney, she asked him if he was behind recent land purchases in Central Florida; Bavar later described that Disney "looked like I had thrown a bucket of water in his face" before denying the story... by going over why he <em>wouldn't</em> build a park there. His reaction, combined with other research obtained during her Anaheim visit, led Bavar to author a story on October 21, 1965, where she predicted that Disney was building a second theme park in Florida. Three days later after gathering more information from various sources, the <em>Sentinel</em> published another article headlined, "We Say: 'Mystery Industry' Is Disney". Walt had originally planned to publicly reveal Disney World on November 15, 1965, but in light of the <em>Sentinel</em> story, Disney asked Florida Governor Haydon Burns to confirm the story on October 25, though kept the official reveal on November 15th.

In <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Perfect_Memento_in_Strict_Sense">Perfect Memento in Strict Sense<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> Akyuu most definitely considers Eirin and Kaguya humans as well as Reisen a <em>youkai</em> Earth Rabbit, even though almost a dozen people she could have told her they were Lunarians. The fact that Akyuu later devotes a whole section to a "Lunar Capital Exposition" Eientei hosted in <a class="urllink" href="http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Perfect_Memento_in_Strict_Sense/Kaguya_Houraisan">Kaguya's article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> laughs in the face of an earlier note where in <a class="urllink" href="http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Perfect_Memento_in_Strict_Sense/Eirin_Yagokoro">Eirin's article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where Akyuu thinks she may have "a deep connection to the Lunar Capital."
<ul><li> From various world-building materials, it can be said that most human populace of Gensokyo are generally ignorant of many in-going of the world, mostly because Gensokyo's power-players (read: most named characters), whether it's youkai or humans, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy">are deliberately making it so to maintain Gensokyo's power balance between the races</a>. Best shown in <em>Forbidden Scrollery</em>; Kosuzu who doesn't know these conspiracies freaks out when she finds out the Noh dancer in Hakurei Shrine is a youkai who will control the populace's mind and reporting it to Marisa, the closest seemingly neutral human power-player she has contact with. Unfortunately, to those who know the true event of <em>Hopeless Masquerade</em>, it's no secret that Marisa is one of those who set up Kokoro as the shrine's Noh dancer as the most non-violent mean to channel her power, instead of almost triggering a civil war between the religious factions. What Kosuzu knows as "youkai extermination" is just a staged performance of those involved power-players so there's no misunderstanding over the "controlling the populace's mind" thing, not to stop it. In short, the "secret" is open to those people we, as the fourth wall audience, often fill the exposition shoes in as player characters and main antagonists but not so much for those <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalImportance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalImportance">nameless extras</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">who don't get into fights at the drop of a hat</a>.

The teams may <em>think</em> that they're being all sneaky and secretive in their dealings, but they often get spectators in the form of locals who live near their 'secret' bases, who just want to watch two teams of idiots blow each other up. It's also very heavily implied that the teams know the actual fights don't have much purpose, given that they're quite familiar with both the Administrator and Ms. Pauling, who keep the conflict going, but don't care because they like getting paid.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Dishonored" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Dishonored">Dishonored</a></em>, everyone seems to know something about the fact that Corvo and the Empress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush">had an affair going on</a> and that Emily is his daughter, but either try to talk around it or are somewhat unsure.

As Y'Shtola explains, they saw through it immediately, but Papalymo begged them to keep it a secret to humor her. As well, a part of her figured that they already figured it out, but just didn't want to believe it. It's unknown if the Eorzean leaders knew of this. It is however shown the Warrior of Light had no way of knowing this, regardless of if they started in 1.0 or A Realm Reborn, as the deception was already in play by the time they meet. To her credit, she apologizes for it.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSamsonOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSamsonOption">Israel's nukes</a>. They haven't <em>officially</em> revealed them yet, but when then-Prime Minister Ehud Olmert accidentally (or perhaps accidentally on purpose) said (or at least implied with barely less subtlety than actually setting off one of the nukes) that Israel had nukes in a speech in 2006, the world barely noticed. Of course, there isn't much reason to keep a nuclear arsenal secret—the main point of having it is intimidating the other side not to attack, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrStrangelove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrStrangelove">something a secret doomsday device isn't so good at</a>. The reason for Israel going this route is strategic. Israel's potential regional enemies (e.g. Iran, Iraq, Egypt<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4wgtn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4wgtn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4wgtn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">We should note here that Egypt was never particularly serious about developing a bomb, whatever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomLehrer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomLehrer">Tom Lehrer</a> might say. And that whole "regime change" makes Iraq highly unlikely to try again any time soon.</span>) know it has nukes, and are thus deterred from military action that would threaten Israel's existence. They can't acquire their own nukes because they're parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which forbids owning any (except for the US, the Soviet Union/Russia, China, the UK, and France) and subjects them to IAEA inspections. And they can't withdraw from the NPT without an "imminent threat" to their security (such as a nearby rival having nukes already), which officially doesn't exist because Israel officially refuses to confirm anything.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5nbe2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5nbe2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5nbe2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In theory, at least. In practice, any nation can unilaterally withdraw from a treaty at any time. But doing so with the NPT would be such a diplomatic nightmare (and very likely a trigger to war), being the obvious signal that it is, that not even Iran at its most defiantly nationalistic (during the Ahmedinejad era, 2005-13) ever showed any willingness to risk it.</span> In other words, it's an endless cycle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYouKnowIKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYouKnowIKnow">I Know You Know I Know</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness">Selective Obliviousness</a> on both sides. This serves the interests of both Israel and the other countries involved: the Israelis get their security and their neighbors get a good reason not to fight Israel and also keep the Middle East a nominal nuclear-weapons-free zone; the ambiguity also spares the regional powers the expense of developing their own weapons programs. (Israel's interest, by the way, does <em>not</em> include the fear of IAEA inspections, as many Israelis claim; Israel is <em>not</em> a party to the NPT and unlikely to become one in the foreseeable future, so it's not subject to inspections, and declaring its stockpile would have no effect on that (after all, both India and Pakistan, also non-NPT countries, openly have nuclear weapons and nobody's ever even tried to inspect <em>them</em>)—any Israeli politician mentioning inspections is just trying to scare you.)
<ul><li> It's also politically useful to Israel's main ally, the United States, to play along. US law requires special "national security" exemptions to provide military aid to a known nuclear proliferator (ie any nation other than Russia, China, the UK or France that possesses nukes), which could be controversial for a President to issue during periods when there's not an actual war going on. But since (officially) Israel isn't a <strong>known</strong> nuclear proliferator, there's no need to bother with such an exemption.
</li></ul></li><li> Israel's strategy is not unique. Pakistan had something similar. From the time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PakAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PakAttack">Pakistan became a nuclear power</a> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note61qmr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note61qmr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note61qmr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> depending on how you describe nuclear capability, Pakistan had the ability to detonate a nuclear weapon in the late 1970s, a working deliverable bomb design in the early 1980s and miniaturised weapons sometime later </span> till the first official <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7qaai');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7qaai" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7qaai');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> it has now emerged that at least some tests in China in the late 1980s and early 1990s were actually Pakistani tests </span> test in 1998, Pakistan officially denied it had a nuclear weapon. Those strange, heavily guarded magazines which mysteriously appeared outside major bases and which looked exactly like magazines which have no use but to house nukes? Oh, just some chicken farmer's silo. The tenders given to local companies for the manufacture of special fuses which were only used on warheads? Please, it's a research project. And that's not a plutonium processing plant, it's a training center (which it actually also was). The Pakistani strategy worked like a charm. As long as Pakistan did not wave its capability openly, the US could continue to support it. Its very existence meant that New Delhi and Moscow would not try anything that Pakistan would not like. In 1998, the Indians tested and, well, suddenly Pakistan's strategy was no longer viable.

</li><li> Speaking of military secrets everyone knows about, 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta, more commonly known as Delta Force. The Pentagon refuses to acknowledge its existence, even though the founder, Col. Beckwith, and an early member of the unit, Sgt. Maj. Haney, have written books about it.
</li><li> The military installation located on the southern shore of Groom Lake in Nevada, also known as Area 51:
<ul><li> It has gone through most of its life being barely acknowledged (if at all) by the government, even when it's open knowledge that many advanced aircraft had been developed and tested there over the decades, including the first American jet fighter, the P-59 Airacomet. The secrecy around the base has, of course, fueled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">much</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">debate</a> about just <em>what</em> goes on there.
</li><li> Area 51 has always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">hung its own lampshade</a>. It's on Google Earth, for crying out loud. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">Official government policy</a> before the mid-90s was to refuse to acknowledge in any way that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">massive restricted area (with barbed-wire fences and armed soldiers patrolling it)</a> actually contained one damned thing. It was only revealed when the base was <em>sued</em> for causing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">a horrifying and almost completely unknown disease</a> in several workers by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance">burning toxic waste on site</a></em> rather than disposing of it properly, and refusing to give their doctors information about the unidentified substance even though it might have saved their lives. A story that almost disappeared behind claims of alien saucers. But not quite, and at that point <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleDeniability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleDeniability">the jig was basically up.</a> Though that lawsuit was thrown out by executive order to prevent any details about Groom Lake appearing in court. This did lead to the CIA declassifying a number of documents relating to Area 51's history in 2013, meaning that the US Government has <em>finally</em> officially acknowledged that the base exists.
</li><li> It is fairly well known at this point that Groom Lake is (or at least was) testing ground for new aircraft. Stuff like the B-2, the SR-71, the F-117
</li></ul></li><li> It's fairly well-known that Cheyenne Mountain is the command center of NORAD. This does not tell anybody <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">just what goes on down there,</a> and it deflects attention from more important and more secret sites elsewhere. Misdirection, donchaknow. Just to show that they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">trolling us</a>, there is a door in Cheyenne Mountain with multiple locks on it, labeled "Stargate Command"; it leads to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a broom closet.</span> This was especially funny to anybody who worked in fast food in the nearby town. For years practically every night Domino's Pizza, KFC, and a number of other fast food joints would send a driver up the mountain trail with a massive order that they would hand off at a guarded gate to guards that officially weren't there to feed people that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.norad.mil/AboutNORAD/CheyenneMountainAirForceStation.aspx">technically didn't exist.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> It does make people wonder if the people in NORAD just keep the charade going as a joke.

To that end, expect almost any mention of /b/ anywhere on the Internet to be replied to with "Rules 1 and 2!!!!" even though pretty much everyone knows about /b/ by now. Expect <em>that</em> to get the response "That only applies to raids," but those, too, are likely to get leaked to <em>Encyclopedia Dramatica</em> within 24 hours. (Traditionally while a raid was in process, /b/ trolls would claim to be from eBaum's World, a site held in especially low regard on 4chan.)
<ul><li> In a sense, the new (created circa 2017) board /trash/. It's not on the top list and is designed as a dumping ground for everything that the other boards <em>including /b/</em> cant have (including furries and extreme kinks) and/or don't want to have (such as "generals", threads devoted to a general topic).

</li><li> The WikiLeaks release of US diplomatic cables falls into this category for much of the information. Everyone knows people in the diplomatic service badmouth other governments they deal with because, well, <em>people</em>. It's just not diplomatic to say so.
</li><li> One of the amusing effects, such as that of the existence of Groom Lake, is that if information is classified, people covered by security laws or similar confidentiality rules are not allowed to talk about it until it's specifically declassified, even if everyone else already knows about the information.

</li><li> In-N-Out is far from the only place that has a 'secret' menu or secret items. Many places have some sort of product that isn't on the menu but can still be made. Probably the most well known is the Mc10:35, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds">McDonald's</a> product that combines the Egg McMuffin and the McDouble, so named because it was originally available in the short window of time between the end of breakfast and beginning of lunch at 10:30 AM (but due to the chain now offering all-day breakfast, it can now be made at any time after 10:30). Do note, however, that not every store of a given fast food or café chain will be aware of so-called secret menus, and attempting to order a "secret menu" item at your local Starbucks is something of a barista <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> — you're often advised to simply list the modifications that make up the item.
</li><li> The DiefenBunker — a massive underground complex a short ways outside Ottawa, sold to the country as a transmitting station, but actually intended for continuing government operations in the event of a nuclear strike on the Canadian government. In true Canadian fashion, it remained secret for roughly six minutes, as a suspicious reporter got in a plane and took pictures of the significant number of <em>toilets</em> being stocked there, ready to be taken underground. Far more toilets than would ever be needed for a simple transmission center.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvedon_Hatch_Secret_Nuclear_Bunker">Kelvedon Hatch Secret Nuclear Bunker<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> certainly counts.

That being said, the bunker has been turned into a museum and so the whole "secret" thing is now just an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle">Artifact Title</a>, though it <em>was</em> a closely-guarded secret for many years provided your definition of "closely-guarded" encompasses "most people in the higher levels of the UK Government knew about it".

This is a six-hundred-foot office building in central London; it was built in 1964, appeared in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> in 1966, and contains (among other things) viewing galleries, a souvenir shop, and a restaurant. One can only surmise that making it classified in the first place <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeemedLikeAGoodIdeaAtTheTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeemedLikeAGoodIdeaAtTheTime">Seemed Like A Good Idea At The Time</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8wrr8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8wrr8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8wrr8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">it's equipped with line-of-sight microwave transceivers to carry emergency comms traffic if the landlines are destroyed by act of war or natural disaster</span>, and nobody bothered doing anything about it because declassifying something before its pre-arranged release date (anything between thirty years and a century) requires a small redwood forest's worth of paperwork. In the end, it was officially declassified in 1993 after Labour MP Kate Hoey "revealed" the tower's existence on the floor of the House of Commons, claiming parliamentary privilege as a defense in the (highly unlikely) event anyone tried to prosecute her for the "leak".
</li><li> Likewise, a building in Arlington, Virginia, near The Pentagon, that handled part of the old AUTOVON network was considered a trade secret by AT&amp;T, and at least one website was asked not to reveal its exact location despite the fact that AUTOVON had long since been decommissioned. Thing is, the building in question is a huge mid-rise tower (easily the tallest building in that part of Arlington for a long time); it's easily visible from two busy nearby streets, and even has a huge "AT&amp;T" sign on its penthouse! Not only that, but the building also serves as a central office for Verizon, and its address is easily gotten from several places (including DSL Reports) that list the locations of phone switches.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat">Catherine the Great</a> of Russia ruled, it was a not-secret that she had a bastard son named Alexei by one of her lovers. Given that she treated him like a son and all but said it several times, one could argue that she didn't even consider it a secret, but it wasn't until after she died and her legitimate son took the throne and acknowledged Alexei as his half-brother that it became official.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NSA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NSA">NSA</a>. For a long time, the US government denied its existence<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9s6j3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9s6j3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9s6j3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The NSA's predecessor was listed in the 1957 edition of the U.S. Government Manual</span>, to the point where the standard joke was that NSA stood for No Such Agency. Now, they've got a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.nsa.gov">website<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Particularly amusing in the case of the NSA monitoring center, which does not exist. It's a giant windowless building, with no signage, covered in communications equipment, and directly next to (and visible from) a major highway. It took about 5 minutes for people to figure out what was going on there.
<ul><li> PRISM, the NSA's spying program, is still technically classified, despite the fact that the "classified" information has <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)">its own article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a>, and the US government has admitted to running the program.
</li></ul></li><li> In 2014, we all learned the shocking truth about the NSA: they spy on people. Electronically! Lots of people had a suspicion or already knew that they were being spied by the NSA and other entities (from various nations in the world). The part people <em>didn't</em> know was the extent of the various programs of surveillance and data storage, which was (and is) relatively massive.
</li><li> From time to time, a celebrity will come out of the closet and announce that they are gay, to which the media and public response with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransparentCloset" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransparentCloset">We weren't supposed to know that already?</a>"
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2251451/Sir-Ian-McKellen-Coming-gay-best-thing-I-did.html">According to interviews<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanMcKellen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanMcKellen">Ian McKellen</a> came out to his stepmother, Gladys, he was worried she and the rest of his family (both his biological parents were long since deceased) would reject him. Not only did they not reject him, his stepmother told him she had known for years and was happy he wasn't lying to himself anymore.
</li><li> It was an open secret among the main cast and crew on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBradyBunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBradyBunch">The Brady Bunch</a></em> that Robert Reed who played Mr. Brady was gay. Florence Henderson who played Mrs. Brady said she knew as soon as he kissed her for the first time in the pilot. They never talked about it but they also worked incredibly hard for it not to get out among the public. They respected his privacy but knew the show would get cancelled if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> found out. Reed died from HIV complications in 1992 and his daughter (he was married to a woman for several years after he graduated from college) would later confirm that he was indeed gay.
</li></ul></li><li> Everyone throughout Congress and the administration knew that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> was completely disabled in his legs from polio. The press corps knew as well but they werent allowed to take photos of him getting in and out of cars. The public knew he was limp but not an invalid (his words) because he developed a system to feign being able to walk that convinced people he could. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10zt9h');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10zt9h" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10zt9h');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He used a cane and braces and then had one of his sons travel with him at all times to lean on so he could transfer his weight.</span> Theres only a few clear photos of him in a wheelchair. Whether or not people knew and didnt care for whatever reason or if it was kept out of public eye as a product of happening before most families had televisions is unknown.
</li><li> Pretty much everyone in the world knew of the existence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecretIntelligenceService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecretIntelligenceService">MI6</a>—heck, it's the subject of one of the world's most popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond">film series</a>—but the British government didn't acknowledge its existence until 1994, when an Act of Parliament gave it official status.
</li><li> In WWII when British intelligence was more of an Old Boy Network, MI6 agent Nicholas Elliott was undergoing a routine security vetting.
<div class="indent"><strong>Security Officer:</strong> Does your wife know what you do? <br/><strong>Elliott:</strong> Yes. <br/><strong>Security Officer:</strong> How did that come about? <br/><strong>Elliott:</strong> Well she was my secretary for two years and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">I think the penny might have dropped</a>. <br/><strong>Security Officer:</strong> Quite so. What about your mother? <br/><strong>Elliott:</strong> She thinks I'm in something called SIS which she believes stands for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecretIntelligenceService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecretIntelligenceService">Secret Intelligence Service</a>. <br/><strong>Security Officer:</strong> Good God! How did she come to know that? <br/><strong>Elliott:</strong> A member of the War Cabinet told her at a cocktail party. <br/><strong>Security Officer:</strong> Then what about your father? <br/><strong>Elliott:</strong> He thinks I'm a spy. <br/><strong>Security Officer:</strong> So why would he think you're a spy? <br/><strong>Elliott:</strong> Because the Chief told him in the bar at White's.
</div></li><li> Anyone working in a top-secret position is not technically supposed to acknowledge their place of employment. However, those who live near these locations know who the major employer is because word gets out quickly. If you're making decent money, have a degree in fields relevant to these agencies, and live within a certain radius of said agency, the locals will generally assume you are employed by them.
<ul><li> The secret is even more open during job interviews, especially for those that work for contracting companies, where neither the company nor applicant are technically allowed to mention to the other that they contract with said agency. When you show up to a job interview with a defense contractor with a resume listing a top secret clearance, years of experience working for places known to contract with a top-secret agency, and a list of skills utilized exclusively with said agency, there is very little doubt who one is contracted with. To get around the inconvenience of not being able to directly mention the contracting agency, the interviewers usually will say things such as "so are you still in government spaces" or "do you work down the hill", or some other blatant stand-in for the agency they can't technically mention.
</li></ul></li><li> A variation comes when police talk to the media about suicides, especially murder-suicides, but don't confirm that the incident was one. It becomes this when their official statement is something like "The death of the members of this family was clearly homicide. No, we're not looking for anyone. No, no one else is at risk."
<ul><li> In a similar vein, any obituary that uses the phrase "died suddenly" or "died unexpectedly" without anything more specific is highly likely to be about a suicide.
</li></ul></li><li> The Church of Scientology has several of these, but the most notable is the OT-3 material (the notorious "Xenu story"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11dd8b');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11dd8b" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11dd8b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> It holds that a good deal of contemporary human suffering and unconscious human behavior is caused by the lingering spirits of aliens murdered by Xenu, a malevolent galactic emperor who attacked Earth with hydrogen bombs in the distant past.</span>). Ask any Scientologist, and they will claim never to have heard of the story in question. Officially, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteryCult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteryCult">only long-time Church members can have it "revealed" to them</a> after paying for a certain number of auditing sessions, and the Church's public relations department refrains from mentioning or acknowledging it in any statements to the general public about their doctrine and practices. This is despite the fact that the Church has discussed it in court, their current leader David Miscavige alluded to it in an interview on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Nightline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Nightline">Nightline</a></em>, recordings exist on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LRonHubbard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LRonHubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a> discussing it, countless books and television programs have discussed it without libel action being taken, and literally every ex-Scientologist who reached OT-3 confirms it. So much has already been leaked to the public and spread by word of mouth that it's now the <em>only</em> thing that many people know about the religion.
</li><li> Likewise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mormonism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mormonism">Mormon</a> temple rites, as represented by the garments that members wear, termed "magic underwear" by non-Mormon wags. They're meant to be hidden at all times and not discussed with non-Mormons (if they're visible at all, it's supposed to be a sign that the wearer's clothing isn't modest enough), but the advent of the internet has blown the secret right out of the water. This is especially true now that there's a Church-produced video on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> explaining it.
<ul><li> Subverted in the sense that, like some other aspects of the LDS faith, it's not really "secret", but members are reminded that they are "sacred". The difference is that "secret" implies that it's only meant for a small number of people to zealously guard against ever being known, which is not the case. Rather, members would like nothing more than for everyone to meet the requirements and learn more about them.
</li><li> Officially the church didn't admit in public that it practiced polygamy until 1852 (about a decade-and-a-half after it started, and 38 years before the practice was given up), but it was widely known and a major source of the persecution that led them to flee to Utah in the first place.
</li></ul></li><li> Drones attacked people in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pakistan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pakistan">Pakistan</a> near the Afghan border. No one admitted to operating these drones, but everyone knows that the United States did it.
</li><li> Guinea secretly aided some rebels in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Liberia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Liberia">Liberia</a>'s civil war, but journalists reported this as an open secret.
</li><li> Lawyers defending the Guantánamo detainees who are being tried have complained that they're not allowed to mention in court that their clients were tortured (as such information is still considered classified) even though this is common knowledge and everyone, including the current and former presidents of the United States, have acknowledged that waterboarding had been used.
</li><li> Composer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YokoKanno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YokoKanno">Yoko Kanno</a> has long collaborated with a reclusive singer named Gabriela Robin. It is an open secret that Gabriela Robin is really Yoko Kanno's singing persona; nevertheless, Kanno refuses to officially comment, though she finally outed herself somewhat by performing Gabriela Robin's songs live in 2007.
</li><li> Britain's Ordnance Survey maps are rightly acclaimed as one of the best, most accurate and most detailed representations available anywhere. This leads to several rather contradictory situations brought about by the military origins of the OS—the maps were first created for military use, hence the name—and the fact they have evolved over a century of refinement and differing priorities. For instance, the location of Britain's special forces bases is officially a secret, but anyone buying the relevant map section will see an Army barracks with virtually all its buildings faithfully represented and even <em>named</em> as Stirling Lines. Anyone looking for the Aldermaston nuclear research base, or the American spy station at Menwith Hill, however, will just see rolling empty countryside with no apparent sign a large military installation is there. Despite the fact that locals will happily point you to the radomes and buildings and razor wire fences.
</li><li> Within the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> music arrange circle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YuuheiSatellite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YuuheiSatellite">Yuuhei Satellite</a>, there's vocalist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLowercaseLetters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLowercaseLetters">senya</a>, who keeps her true identity hidden with a mask whenever she's out in public as part of the group. Those who follow the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BEMANI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BEMANI">BEMANI</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BEMANI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BEMANI">music scene</a> know her better as BEMANI vocalist Mayumi Morinaga. While neither Yuuhei Satellite nor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami">Konami</a> has officially said anything on the matter, it's quite obvious to those who listen to her songs, especially given that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoundVoltex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoundVoltex">Sound Voltex</a></em> has a number of Yuuhei Satellite songs and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Beatmania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Beatmania">beatmania</a> IIDX</em> features the song "Torikago no Houou", a collaboration track between the group and L.E.D. (with whom Mayumi also does songs with), with "senya" credited as the vocalist.
</li><li> A lot of cycling transfers are this. The UCI rules state that a rider transferring from one ProTeam (World Tour) to another team is not allowed to conclude (i.e. sign) a contract before the 1st of August, and the rider and new team are not allowed to talk about it in the media, while the old team can state that the rider will leave after the season. This leads to high profile transfers being open secrets. Everyone knows that rider A transfers to team X (e.g. Landa to Sky for the 2016 season), but it's not officially known before the late stages of the season.
</li><li> At one point the Italian government's way of keeping the locations of their military bases secret was to just black out the areas of the map they could be found on. While this did indeed keep the <em>precise</em> location of the bases' secret, it certainly provided a good starting point for finding them.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a> once called the longbow England's "unsecret weapon": their rivals knew how to make them and how to train people to use them, but the training took a <em>long</em> time, and they didn't want to let commoners become that valuable when they could just teach them to use crossbows instead.

Because most of the group's songs use beats lifted from other artists, the producers at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PsychopathicRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PsychopathicRecords">Psychopathic Records</a> release their music under a separate label to avoid legal trouble, and they don't officially acknowledge that the Rydas are all popular Psychopathic artists.
</li><li> The idea that the UK even <em>had</em> a MI5 was never officially acknowledged until the 1989 Security Service Act. Four years later, Stella Rimington was the first person to be officially identified as MI5 Director-General. But everyone <em>knew</em> MI5 existed and had an idea of what it did.
</li><li> Rituals of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherhoodOfFunnyHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherhoodOfFunnyHats">Freemasons</a>. Masonic lodges started to operate openly in 1717 and the first Masonic exposé was published in 1724. Conspiracy nuts and the just plain curious love to publish (and read) the so-called "secrets", but members still refuse to discuss them with outsiders because they have promised not to and Masons consider themselves as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord">men of their word</a>. Also just reading the ritual instead of participating in it cannot give proper context.

</li><li> Celebrities and models owe their good looks and flawless physiques to nothing more than good genes, rigorous dieting, and fanatical fitness regimes. There are <em>not</em> any wigs, weaves, toupees, botox injections, collagen injections, breast implants, facelifts, liposuction, dental work, or other cosmetic procedures performed on any of these people. There are <em>not</em> private resorts where celebrities can go to have work done and remain out of the public eye until the healing is complete and the swelling and bruising is gone.
</li><li> Celebrities who behave badly in public and get called out for it are <em>always</em> having a <em>bad reaction</em> to <em>perfectly legal</em> prescription or over-the-counter drugs or just exhausted. They are <em>not</em> intoxicated or taking anything illegal. Likewise, celebrities who have posted embarrassing or inflammatory things online have <em>always</em> just had their Facebook / Twitter / iPhone hacked/stolen/compromised. It wasn't them, and they have no idea what happened or who might have done it.
</li><li> Spy satellites are usually classified by the countries that produce them, with everything up to the fact that spy satellites <em>exist</em> being a secret. This is despite the fact that all it takes to detect a spy satellite is to... look up. Amateur star watchers can easily detect them, and a catalog of all satellites in space, including those used for spying, has been produced and recorded. The more tightly held secrets, as to what kind of data each satellite collects, may not be known by average citizens, but all major governments will have collected satellite emissions trajectories and from this generated a rather accurate estimation of exactly what the satellite is being used for. Politically every government will pretend none of these satellites exist; in reality, it's generally assumed every government is fully aware of their existence, and generally what is being collected by every one of them. The only real secrets these satellites possibly hold are how accurate their instruments are, and how closely the government is looking at the data they get back.
</li><li> The identities of high school mascots are generally well-known to the student body thanks to the mascot's closest friends, but it is not allowed to be revealed in any school-sanctioned publication or at a school-sanctioned event. It's more difficult with college mascots, as colleges are usually too big to get the secret out, or with professional sports teams, where there isn't a closely-knit school community that the info can be distributed to.
<ul><li> One notable aversion of the trope in this specific context is West Virginia University's Mountaineer mascot, a student dressed in frontier costume and carrying an actual musket. Since the Mountaineer's face is visible to the public, there's no point in even trying to keep his (or, in one year, her) identity secret, so WVU holds open auditions for the position and publicly announces the winner.
</li></ul></li><li> Often, on film and TV productions, actors, especially those who aren't the leads, are absolutely sworn to secrecy. However, it can be easy to figure out in some cases that someone is working on a certain project even when they're being tight-lipped.
<ul><li> For example, <a class="urllink" href="https://vulkanmagazine.com/content/amy-rutberg/">this interview<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from April 2018 with East Coast actress Amy Rutberg, who plays Foggy Nelson's girlfriend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableAlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableAlphaBitch">Marci Stahl</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015">Daredevil (2015)</a></em>. During the interview, the interviewer asked Rutberg what her future film and TV projects included, and she said one of them was "a super secret project Ive been working on since November that will be out later this year" that was not <em>Daredevil</em>, considering that the season had begun shooting in New York City in mid-November 2017. Closer to the wrap date in mid-May 2018, the veil of secrecy lifted and Rutberg was able to officially confirm her role in <em>Daredevil</em> through interviews and her social media pages (posting photographs of yourself with your co-stars <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieCox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieCox">Charlie Cox</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeborahAnnWoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeborahAnnWoll">Deborah Ann Woll</a> and Wilson Bethel certainly helps).
</li></ul></li><li> The Netflix Marvel shows use working titles for the film permits issued to their production companies by the NYPD, ostensibly to make it harder for spies and leakers to follow them.

</li><li> Dubai is notorious among Asia (and often their diaspora cousins) to have been built off what is effectively modern-day slavery, but you can't criticize it IN Dubai because dissenters will be punished. There's even a huge article titled "human rights in Dubai" that details <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeASlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeASlave">the human-rights VIOLATIONS</a> that Dubai has constantly been criticized for, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherIsWatching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherIsWatching">near-absolute censorship</a> that keeps journalists from talking about it in most of the city, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless">the massive corruption in law enforcement</a> that allows the first two to take place.

Despite the design similarities being very obvious and intentional, the toys go under different names, lack faction symbols, and often even come with comics or similar material to characterize them. So officially, for instance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Howling Meteor</a> is an original character created and owned by the company Maketoys, and any resemblance he has to Starscream is at most a homage and more likely coincidence.

That these pieces, when in place, caused the figure's face to resemble that of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChallengeOfTheGoBots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChallengeOfTheGoBots">Challenge Of The Go Bots</a></em> character Cy-Kill, who used the same toy as the Bike Robo but whose rights are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers">split up among several companies</a>, is strictly happenstance.
</li><li> There is no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInternetIsForPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInternetIsForPorn">porn</a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Youtube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Youtube">Youtube</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook">Facebook</a>, or <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Instagram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Instagram">Instagram</a>. None. <em>Especially</em> not BDSM or fetish porn that could get around automated censors by not showing intercourse or nudity. And there are absolutely no ways to download these videos for later use in case they're taken down...
</li><li> Whenever a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragQueen">Drag Queen</a> is selected to compete on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RuPaulsDragRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RuPaulsDragRace">RuPaul's Drag Race</a></em> or any other drag reality show, they're sworn to non-disclosure clauses until the cast is officially revealed. However, if the queen has a large enough following in her local scene and/or social media, her fans <em>will</em> note that she has suspiciously gone missing during the months that the season is filming. Even queens who weren't selected will sometimes go dark during that time, just to drum up hype that they <em>might</em> be appearing on the show.
</li><li> The existence of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_with_limited_recognition">unrecognized states.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> For all diplomatic purposes, it's not "The Republic of China in Taiwan," it's "Chinese Taipei," and it's not "The Republic of Kosovo," it's "Kosovo, the state within Serbia." For pretty much every other meaningful purpose, Kosovo and Taiwan are independent countries and have been for decades: they negotiate on their own terms, have their own governments, embassies, and militaries, are not meaningfully incorporated in the governments of Serbia and China, and Taiwan even competes in the Olympics separately from China. But because certain powerful countries refuse to acknowledge them and other powerful countries don't want to torpedo their relationships with those countries, most official negotiations and maps refer to them as if they're incorporated territories. (For a few decades, the situation with China and Taiwan was even reversed; the UN treated Taiwan as the true Chinese government and ignored that 95% of its landmass and population was under control of a different power.)
</li><li> The Hitachi Wand is one of the most famous vibrators in the world, but for decades it was officially "just" a personal massager, as the Japanese company didn't want to be known for making sex toys. For a brief period in 2013, Hitachi ceased production of the Wand altogether for this reason. Eventually their North American distributor, Vibratex, convinced them to continue making the product and to simply omit the Hitachi name from the packaging, at which point Vibratex became a lot more straightforward in marketing the Wand as a sex toy.
</li><li> The "Inspector Sands" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CodeEmergency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CodeEmergency">PA system codeword</a> used at British football stadiums to alert staff that the fire alarm had been set off. It was originally devised so that people wouldn't run for the exits and potentially cause a crush, but it wasn't terribly hard to guess what it meant<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note133m72');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note133m72" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note133m72');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">at least at the time; before proper fire extinguishers came down in price, the go-to emergency firefighting equipment was buckets of sand</span> and most of the time the alarm would be traced to somebody ignoring a "No Smoking" sign anyway.
