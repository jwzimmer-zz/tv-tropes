<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheTwelveKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheTwelveKingdoms">The Twelve Kingdoms</a></em> has a truly weird reproductive system involving marriage but apparently no sex: when you get married, a fruit called Ranka grows on a tree, and out of it pops your baby. What makes it far weirder is that sometimes the Ranka fruit gets blown across the sea and is implanted in a Japanese woman - this is how the central character of the anime, Youko Nakajima, would have been born, though she thought she was a normal Japanese girl until she was taken by force from her high school. In addition, royalty and other immortals can't marry - and since Nakajima becomes a queen, that includes her - and so they can't have children unless they were married before they become immortal. While it's established that they DO have sex it's apparently only done for fun, with no connection to the reproductive process at all.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> the Nameks have only one gender (Males). They reproduce by puking eggs containing their offspring out of their mouths. This greatly confuses Bulma. She gives Dende a lesson that's very reminiscent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTalk">The Talk</a>, only for him to ask what a woman is.
<ul><li> Whis alludes to this during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> when he comments that he thought pregnancy was only carried by the female in humans (which it is), but he could easily be misremembering. This implies that other methods, like Namekians, are not uncommon.

</li><li> Transformers in IDW's <em>Transformers</em> comic have a truly bizarre reproductive cycle that doesn't even involve sex of any kind. There are "hot spots" on Cybertron and its moons where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent">sparks</a> form and are then "ignited" by an energy pulse from Vector Sigma, the life-giving core of Cybertron. This is known as 'forging'. Once the sparks are lit they are carefully removed from the ground and placed within a special kind of incubator known as the 'protoform', which it merges with. It then begins to take a form usually based on the person whom it has the most contact with as a protoform, and rapidly begins to develop the parts it needs for its future alt-mode. This all takes less than an hour, and the development from 'sparkling' into a full-size adult takes about two weeks.
<ul><li> They can also artificially reproduce through "cold construction," which involves surgically removing a portion of the spark from another cybertronian and using it to grow a new one. There was much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">bigotry</a> towards cold constructed bots in Cybertron's old days (to the point of there being a cybertronian apartheid) as they were seen as blasphemy towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotReligion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotReligion">Primus</a> but it's more or less died out after the Great War.
</li><li> This trope is also deconstructed; this form of reproduction is so bizarre and impractical that when the life-creating pulsewaves from Vector Sigma started dwindling to a stop, it put the cybertronian race in serious concern about the future of their existence. By the time of the comics all of the hot spots on Cybertron have stopped creating sparks (there <em>are</em> hot spots on some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostColony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostColony">metrotitan-created colonies</a> but it's not said if they're still working). This, alongside the Great War, has greatly reduced the cybertronian population, making them an endangered species in galactic terms.
</li><li> We later learn in <em>More Than Meets The Eye</em> that cold construction <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">actually involves taking essence from the Matrix (an ancient artifact) and using it to grow sparks in a lab, making transformer biology even <em>weirder</em>.</span>
</li><li> The G2 comics feature an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> who wants to return Transformers to their original reproduction method of budding off of each other.
</li></ul></li><li> In an issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlueBeetle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlueBeetle">Blue Beetle</a></em>, Jaime Reyes, having been teleported to Reach space, hitches a ride back to Earth with a space smuggler called Moonrunner. He suggests that they shake hands and agree not to betray each other, but Moonrunner refuses because he doesn't "like [Jaime] that way", at which point the scarab informs Jaime that Moonrunner's species reproduces by shaking hands.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Venom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Venom">Venom</a>'s species, the Symbiotes, reproduce asexually by having each individual spawning a child once in its life. Venom gave birth to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Carnage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Carnage">Carnage</a> that way, while Carnage himself gave birth to Toxin later. However, Venom had several additional "seeds" capable of producing more Symbiotes which were artificially extracted and grown from it by the Life Foundation to make Riot, Phage, Lasher, Agony, and Scream. It's currently unknown if reproducing with these seeds naturally is possible.

Unfortunately for the raging misogynists their natural ability to change sex later in life means that cloning a man might result in a girl.

<ul><li> Several <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> fan works posit that elves have bizarre reproductive anatomy. The women have tiny, tube-like tentacles that suck the sperm out of the males — and this is compatible with human anatomy, making the fics fit seamlessly into the Tolkienverse. It also gives a somewhat disturbing explanation as to why there is no fertile male elf-female human couple known in the history of Middle Earth.

Vector Prime produces Protoforms (a.l.a. Beast Wars) which have to be initialized by one to five other Cybertronians, taking on aspects of all the parents. Alternatively, female Cybertronians (called Makers), which are very rare, can interface with a male Cybertronian, splitting off a part of each partner's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent">Spark</a> and gestating it until it becomes a new complete Spark, at which point is is transferred into a new body built by the Maker.

Also, Ichigo is slated to have three parents: Kaien, Masaki, and Isshin, with Kaien as one of the third-sexers. The other characters who are going to go through second puberty are Kougaiji, Juushirou, Yumichika, and Retsu; those are just the ones who are known by this point.

<ul><li> The Xenomorph lifecycle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Alien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Alien">Alien</a></em> goes roughly as follows:
<ul><li> Queen lays eggs
</li><li> Egg waits for host (Human, Predator, Dog Etc) to come by
</li><li> Egg hatches, facehugger crawls out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceFullOfAlienWingwong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceFullOfAlienWingwong">jumps on host's face</a>.
</li><li> Facehugger hangs on to host's face for day or two, host unconscious, facehugger keeps Host alive but tightens tail around neck if attempt to remove facehugger is made.
</li><li> Facehugger lets go and promptly dies.
</li><li> Host acts normal for another day or two (may/may not be aware of pregnancy).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chestburster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chestburster">Chestburster</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">bursts out of chest</a>, with some of host's DNA (eg; Chestburster from dog becomes quadripedal drone instead of bipedal drone).
</li><li> Chestburster quickly grows up into either Drone or Queen.
</li><li> If Queen, cycle starts again.
</li></ul></li><li> Although not actually alien, the creatures from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tremors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tremors">Tremors</a></em> series have a bizarre life cycle that qualifies for this trope. Eggs hatch into baby "Graboids" the size of large rodents called "Dirt Dragons", which grow into full grown bus-sized Graboids; three to six large dog-sized "Shriekers" (each capable of rapid parthenogenesis) burst from the mature Graboid at the end of it's cycle, killing it; mature Shriekers pupate, then emerge as winged "Ass Blasters", which lay eggs and are roughy the same size as Shriekers. It is shown that the entire process is asexual, with Ass Blasters developing a new Graboid egg within a matter of hours.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KPax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KPax">K-PAX</a></em>, K-PAXians are known to have a very painful mating experience, "like having your nuts in a vice, but all over". The process also involves nausea and a terrible smell.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> movies show the über-orc Uruk-Hai growing out of weird pit full of presumably magical mud stired by regular Orcs, the Uruk-Hai is born fully grown and even some times kills the stirer. This is movie-only, as reproduction of Orcs is never established in the books (and is still today subject of a lot of fan debate) but is presumably a way to represent how the Uruk-Hai were created by Saruman.

(Occasionally one grub will turn into twins.) The Yeerk parents die in the process.
</li><li> The Skrit Na are even stranger. The "Skrit" look sort of like giant roaches and are fairly stupid. At some point during their lives they spin a cocoon, die, but then out of their dead body a Na (basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys">a Grey)</a> pops out. It's never explained where new Skrit come from, but the Na certainly have a weird way of coming into this (or some other) world.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves">Lo'ona Aeo</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikhailAkhmanov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikhailAkhmanov">Mikhail Akhmanov</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArrivalsFromTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArrivalsFromTheDark">Arrivals from the Dark</a></em> series have four sexes. Their approximate names are male, female, half-male, and half-female. Half-females are sterile and don't participate in the reproductive process. Males and half-males join their minds with females, which starts the "mental contamination" process and impregnates the female without actual physical contact. The resulting child's personality is based on all three parents. Until their maturity, Lo'ona Aeo can artificially induce a slightly different sex on themselves using medical means (e.g. an immature half-female can make herself a female). Reproduction is directed by the heads of extended families in order to prevent unwanted genetic branches. Thus, they may force a female to become a half-female in order to cut off any possible offspring from that line. <br/>The novels describe a unique case of a human male (descended from a human-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAlien">Faata</a> hybrid) using his latent telepathic abilities to accidentally "mentally contaminate" a Lo'ona Aeo female. Her son ended up lacking the extreme xenophobia that all Lo'ona Aeo have and becomes an adventurer (a quality inherited from his father). Since Lo'ona Aeo live for over 1000 years, he has encountered several of his father's human descendants.
</li><li> Though they can breed perfectly fine with humans, Martians in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Barsoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Barsoom">Barsoom</a></em> series lay eggs for some inexplicable reason<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1utcs');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1utcs" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1utcs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">well, it's <em>explained</em> as an evolutionary adaptation; what's <em>not</em> explained is how they can interbreed with humans despite this fairly fundamental reproductive incompatibility, how the egg <em>increases in size</em> during its five-year incubation period, and why on Barsoom the females still have mammaries</span>. Yes, even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Half Human Hybrids</a>.
</li><li> The alien city dwellers from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BlindLake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BlindLake">Blind Lake</a></em> have two stages in life. The sentient adult form is neuter and has a special feeding apparatus which the parasitic larval form require in order to survive. It's the larvae that actually do the breeding. On occasion, a larva is infected by the virus present in the adults and will transform into an adult itself.
</li><li> The mantis-like Ki! from <em>Chess With a Dragon</em> are hermaphroditic parasitoids, who implant eggs in "host-grubs" of various non-sentient species <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> including feral human children they only think are dumb animals</span>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheColorOfDistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheColorOfDistance">The Color of Distance</a></em>'s Tendu hatch in great numbers as tadpoles or narey. Eventually they metamorphize into froglike tinka, and live in the forests for a time until going into a village and acting as servants. Some tinka are chosen and treated to transform into bami, able to speak and reason and somewhere between children and apprentices. Bami, when those they were chosen by die or are exiled, are transformed again into sexually mature elders. Rarely elders will choose to become enkar, but this last stage is more a cultural than physical change. All levels eat some of the plentiful fertilized eggs and narey, and few tinka are chosen so that most die of animal attacks or old age, in order to help keep populations down.
</li><li> The Nac Mac Feegle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> has one female to a tribe, who is the Kelda and is married to the most powerful warrior. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser">It's her job to do the thinking for the entire tribe</a> and, although she's their ruler, she's also, in a way, a prisoner. Female births are very rare and girls are expected, upon reaching adulthood, to either find a tribe whose Kelda has recently died or collect a few men from nearby tribes to form a new tribe. In either case, she takes some of her brothers with her to keep her company until she gets to know her new people. Incidentally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a> was quite interested in bees and their swarming behaviours.

The kicker is that <em>all this is done unconsciously on instinct.</em>

</div><ul><li> Between their advanced knowledge of the universe, their shape-shifting nature and the wide range of powers they are able to borrow from each other, the Gods and Demons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DivineBloodNovels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DivineBloodNovels">Divine Blood</a></em> are capable of this even if it's not their normal choice.

Each Loom weaves Family members according to a common template, ensuring that they're related; every Family member is a genetically a cousin to each other.
</li><li> The Fire-lizards of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern">Dragonriders of Pern</a></em> series (and consequently the dragons that were engineered from them) have two kinds of female and three kinds of male, though only one male and female of any of the types is required to produce offspring of all types. Further, these are typically of one specific set of types (gold and bronze) as they are respectively the most intelligent and best endurance flyers of the different types. How exactly this system came about is never explained, nor does it appear to be shared by any other native species on Pern.
</li><li> In the world of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEggMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEggMan">The Egg Man</a></em>, pregnancy results in the birth of a myriad of "fetus flies", tiny humans with wings, who fly off and live like wild animals across the urban landscape, with most of them dying before they're old enough to walk. The ones who do grow to the point where they resemble regular children are caught by one corporation or another and raised to become corporate citizens.
</li><li> The Hosts in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Embassytown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Embassytown">Embassytown</a></em> have a cycle that's skimmed over, but there is an initial aquatic phase of life, where the young Hosts are referred to a "elvers", a terrestrial phase where young play and fight, middle age and sapience, and their final phase, lumbering and nonsentient. They evolved to reach that phase and wander mindlessly after younger Hosts who at the time would eat them, but modern civilized Hosts, with no need of that, abhor the idea and treat elders kindly until they drop.
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Everworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Everworld">Everworld</a></em>: Male Hetwan, though usually little more than perfectly obedient drones for their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">deity</a> Ka Anor, will immediately go nuts and mate with any female they see, which looks like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">living collection of guts</a>. A collection of eight to ten offspring are born immediately — which is good, because the males rip the females to pieces <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex">while having sex</a>.
</li><li> The Rozes, troll/giant hybrids from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GarrettPI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GarrettPI">Garrett, P.I.</a></em> series, claim to be "triplets with different mothers". Garrett has never been inclined to ask for details, so we don't know if it's this trope or a cultural thing.
</li><li> The Phagors from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Helliconia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Helliconia">Helliconia</a></em> trilogy have a cyclical libido, such that males are compelled to mate once every few days. They barely ever think about sex otherwise, yet the fact that such matings are conducted without any pretense of privacy, just as a human might sneeze in public, leads most humans to consider them lustful perverts.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertJSawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertJSawyer">Robert J. Sawyer</a>'s <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IllegalAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IllegalAlien">Illegal Alien</a></em>, the Tosoks' females have four wombs, so that group sex is the norm for them, with four males impregnating each. Half-siblings are also far more common as a result. Occasionally though just one male inseminates all four of a female's wombs. Their term for God possibly even reflects that - one human, learning about all this, reflects how they thought the Tosoks were saying "Foremother" but it may have really been "<em>Four</em>mother".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven">Larry Niven</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnownSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnownSpace">Known Space</a></em>
<ul><li> When asked, the Puppeteers say they have three sexes, but its not quite accurate. What they have is a "sperm depositor" male, an "egg depositor" male (really a female), and a non-sentient "female" (actually a different species that reproduces among themselves in a different way) called a "Bride". The Puppeteer ovum is deposited in the flesh of the Bride, the egg is then fertilized, and when the egg hatches, the infant puppeteer eats its way out of the body of the "female". In the <em>Fleet of Worlds</em> novels, it's revealed that this is <em>invariably</em> fatal to the Bride. This is based on real-life parasitoids, though these instead have the male fertilise the female who then lays fertilised eggs in a host.
</li><li> Actually, pretty much all species in Known Space other than humans (and other hominids) and dolphins have a pretty thin time of it when it comes to sex. It's kind of Niven's trademark. It's likely that the Moties, who die if they don't get pregnant, were Niven's idea rather than Pournelle's.
</li><li> The hominids of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ringworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ringworld">Ringworld</a></em> kind of make up for it by having robust interspecies sex a regular part of trade and politics.
</li><li> See also the Fuxes (below).
</li></ul></li><li> The mental patient "prot" from the novel series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KPax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KPax">K-PAX</a></em> describes the K-PAXians' mating process as being extremely unpleasant, involving profound pain, nausea and a potent terrible smell. The books tie this in with a kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalProcreationClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalProcreationClause">Immortal Procreation Clause</a> — since the K-PAXian lifespan is over a thousand years, combined with the unappealing mating process, there's no problem with either under OR overpopulation.
</li><li> Gethenians in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLeftHandOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLeftHandOfDarkness">The Left Hand of Darkness</a></em> are usually asexual and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBiologicalSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBiologicalSex">genderless</a>, but go through a stage each year called kemmer, lasting about 25 days. While in kemmer a Gethenian will become either male or female with no control over which sex they take, unless they use certain chemicals. During kemmer their body is essentially in a state of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MateOrDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MateOrDie">Mate or Die</a>, so incest during this time is generally not frowned upon, certainly during pubescence, unless it becomes a romantic attachment. They might "keep kemmer" (have a long-term partner) or "vow kemmer" (the equivalent of marriage), but the vast majority of Gethenians are polygamous during kemmer, and most openly visit kemmer-houses to mate with whoever else happens to be there.

</li><li> <em>Medea: Harlan's World</em> was a collaboration between a number of major SF writers to create a single setting, and a series of short stories set on the titular moon. In <em>Flare Time</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven">Larry Niven</a>, the reproductive cycle of the native sentients known as fuxes is described. They start off as six-legged females. At around seven they have their first litter, during which their rear body segment tears off, leaving them as four-legged females. The hindquarters contain the eggs, and function as a nest which the newborns eat their way out of. Around seventeen they have a second litter, leaving them as two-legged <em>males</em>, with the male organs exposed through the loss of the second body segment. The male guards the nest until the young are born, then goes into heat for about three years, and eventually ends up a 'post-male'.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MyTeacherIsAnAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MyTeacherIsAnAlien">My Teacher Is an Alien</a></em> series makes mention of a species that requires "five genders to produce an egg, and another three to hatch it". It's a kids series, so we aren't given any details on how this works.
</li><li> The main alien race in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregEgan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregEgan">Greg Egan</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Orthogonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Orthogonal">Orthogonal</a></em> trilogy is a gold mine for this trope.
<ul><li> Sex immediately induces reproduction; there is no gestation period.
</li><li> Sex consists of two of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shapeshifting">Shapeshifting</a> aliens melding the flesh of their chests, through which the male transmits a light-based signal into the female's body to induce the reproductive process. No actual matter or bodily substance is exchanged; genetic diversity is ensured through the infrared transmission of "influences" by <em>every</em> individual to <em>everyone around them</em> — which, incidentally, is also how diseases spread.
</li><li> Females reproduce by splitting into four children; two sets of male-female twins respectively referred to as cos, who are genetically ideal mates for each other. The children who are not cos to each other are referred to as brothers and sisters, but the same terms are generally not used to refer to cos, probably to avoid implying that the relationship between cos is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">BrotherSister Incest</a>.

The Grdoch lack any paternal feelings towards their young and frequently used them to distract larger predators or even as a light snack. In space, small, chaotically bouncing shapes can prove to be a hazard on any ship, but the Grdoch haven't found any way of preventing that, especially during battles, where the stress causes such "births".

<ul><li> The Vulcans have "Pon farr", a mating season every seven years, where they must mate or die. Alternatively they can beat another competitor to their desired mate to death, which is just plain weird.
</li><li> Xyrillian females can impregnate human males without the human noticing. The one time this happened in the show she hadn't been aware this was possible. They technically reproduce asexually; the "male" Xyrillians don't contribute any DNA to the process, they just carry the female's child.

</li><li> The Varro mate for life, and to ensure this they intermix their body chemistry, causing symptoms of physical withdrawal if a mate leaves.
</li><li> All we know about Klingon sex is that it's not uncommon for both partners to break bones. Ow. A broken collarbone on the wedding night is a sign of good luck. Of course, given how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Klingons tend to act</a>, that might simply be a cultural tendency towards <em>very</em> rough sex.
</li><li> 90% of Taresians are born female. They claim to reproduce by implanting embryos in the wombs of females of other species, but the child will be fully Tersian. The truth is even weirder: They spread a retrovirus that turns males of other species into pseudo-Teresians, and then he's driven to return to the planet where they'll extract his DNA, fatally.
</li><li> Female Ocampa go through "Elogium", a puberty-like stage where they can successfully conceive a child (in a growth on their back), but it only happens once. Also leads to a very large bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a>, every Ocampa female can only conceive once, and multiples births seem to be rare to non-existent... so if every female Ocampa can only produce one child in their entire life... how is the species not extinct already? The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> factor of Ocampan reproduction goes far further than that: Despite only being able to reproduce once and only living for nine years, the females have constantly engorged breasts. The reason why humans have breasts and dogs don't is because we can reproduce whenever we feel like it - there is no biological reason why they should grow breasts a good <em>four</em> years before they can conceive. Secondly, they reproduce through a bizarre system of massaging feet and gluing their hands together <em>for an entire week</em> using a thick, sticky mucus - in the wild no creature could do this without being eaten by predators. This would logically mean both the males and females have nothing between their legs and are around about the same size - if this was real life and not being played by human actors and actresses the only way to determine a male from a female would be those anomalous breasts.
<ul><li> The "one mating = extinction" dilemma, at least, can be resolved if Ocampa are a sperm-sequestering species, such that one mating provides the male genetic contribution for multiple pregnancies over the female's lifetime. If said subsequent pregnancies happen in quick succession, the constantly-engorged breasts would make sense too: they don't have time to shrink between babies. However the only example we have of an Ocampan family is the alternate future from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekVoyagerS3E20BeforeAndAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekVoyagerS3E20BeforeAndAfter">one episode</a> where Kes had one daughter in her lifetime and the daughter also had only one child.
</li></ul></li><li> The J'naii are supposed to be genderless (although they all look similar to female humans). However, nothing about J'naii reproduction makes any sense, as the script muddles together three totally different kinds of genderlessness. The asexual cast to their society would make sense if they reproduced by cloning, but they do reproduce sexually, in which case being a One-Gender Race should make their interactions more sexual, not less. The persecution of those who prefer a gender would make sense for a race of hermaphrodites (where everyone is both sexes simultaneously) but their sex act is described as a precisely symmetrical affair (i.e. the J'naii are all one single sexthey're isogametes.) An isogamete preferring one sex over another makes about as much sense as a Cyclops preferring one eye over another.

His comments imply the ring becomes more complete as the pregnancy progresses.
<ul><li> In a sense, this is Bizarre in how normal the reproduction was. The Visitors are reptiles from another world posing as humanoids (presumably mammalian). Somehow Robin was impregnated through what appeared to be intercourse, just like it would be between humans.

<ul><li> Illithid Elder Brains (composed of the disembodied brains of dead illithids) asexually produce eggs in pools of water. The eggs hatch into tadpoles that cannibalize each other until the survivors reach maturity. Mature tadpoles are inserted into living adult humanoids to devour and replace the nervous system. This results in an adult illithid. Just to be clear, if an illithid tadpole somehow survives for long enough without a host, it doesn't die. Instead, it grows up into a Neothelid, which resembles a dragon-sized, slime-caked worm with a mass of tentacles for a face, psychic powers, and the ability to breathe acid. Illithids prefer not to talks about them.
</li><li> Beholders also asexually reproduce. After becoming pregnant, they gorge themselves until the fetuses become too large and pinch the esophagus shut. When the children come to term, the parent vomits up its entire uterus (which does not regenerate). <em>Volo's Guide to Monsters</em> gives us another explanation: sometimes, a Beholder may create another Beholder (or some other creature) by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">dreaming</a>.

According to Galkan beliefs, a magnificent light will appear and grant that Galka a new younger body, and seemingly fragments of the memories of their past life. No one else has witnessed this miracle, and no Galka recalls their personal experience of the matter, so there's some who believe it is simply folk lore. But there appears to be truth to it, because after a Galka leaves for their final journey, a new Galkan child arrives to the same Galka village within less than a year latter. No one however, is sure how Galkan's then replenish their numbers, due to death from violence or illness.

<ul><li> The only exception is Manaphy, which will always produce an Egg conatining a Phione (which cannot evolve into Manaphy).
</li></ul></li><li> Some species are male-only or female-only. The male-only species can only reproduce other members of his species with the help of Ditto. How these Pokémon propagate without Ditto's help is unexplained.
<ul><li> The only exceptions being the Nidoran-line and Volbeat/Illumise, where male and female are regarded as different species, but the female can produce offspring of the male species, even if her male is of a different species.
</li></ul></li><li> Some species are genderless and only able to mate with Ditto. Much like Male-only species, how they do it without Ditto isn't explained.
</li><li> Some species cannot reproduce in-game, but some of them are seen to have eggs or babies in other media. An event in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a></em> allows you to get a Cosmog by bringing a Solgaleo or Lunala to a different "version" of Alola and allowing them to meet with the Lunala/Solgaleo of that world. The Cosmog instantly appears after the "meeting" but the player doesn't get to see the exact details of what happens.
</li><li> And the daycare-owner still doesn't know where the eggs come from. Some dialogue with NPCs even suggest that Pokémon eggs aren't even eggs in the biological sense and are more like "cradles"... No explanation is given as to what this is supposed to mean.

When a Glitch couple decide it's time to start a family, they retreat to their bedroom. They then enter a trance-like state and proceed to a secret workshop none of them are consciously aware of, where they assemble their new offspring. Upon completion, they leave the workshop and return home, after which they snap out of the trance. They will have no memory of the event, but are convinced that it was "very pleasant".
</li><li> The Floran are a race of plants and are technically genderless beyond cosmetic details. While nothing canonical is clarified about their reproduction, their respawning animation shows a seed sprouting into a pod that opens to release a reborn Floran. Early beta versions also had "Floran pods" planted in fields. Presumably, the Floran reproduce by pollination leading to seeds that are planted and produce offspring without internal gestation.

<ul><li> The Orphe are a vaguely insect-looking species that reproduce asexually. The method is by sprinkling some "senirapa" water upon themselves (even a single drop will suffice), which causes their body to spontaneously generate two new Orphe. The children possess all the memories of their parent. It is common for dying Orphe to do this as their final act, to ensure that their memories and experiences will not be lost, but the game suggests that they can do it at any time they please, as long as they have some of the water on hand. And this is before one Orphe randomly undergoes a mutation that leads to the sudden birth of the first female of their species.

</li><li> In "Body Shifters Universe", the aliens are human sized bacteria that shapeshift into whatever form a person finds most attractive, absorbs the DNA and divides into two more shifters who continue to mate with the nonshifter parent.
</li><li> The two-headed vertebrate-analogues of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/Snaiad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/Snaiad">Snaiad</a></em> have their first heads contain their genitalia. Mating is accomplished by "kissing", and young are "vomited" out by the parent at birth.
</li><li> ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/Serina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/Serina">Serina</a>
<ul><li> All life on Serina is descended from Earth organisms, but that doesn't stop one clade of birds from evolving this. An early clade are the vivas, birds that give birth to live young by retaining their eggs inside the mother's body until hatching.
</li><li> The changelings, or metamorphs, reproduce more like a fly than a bird: the mother lays tiny delicate eggs in a carcass or larder of meat and abandons them. These hatch into near-embryonic young with only a head and forelimbs developed at all, like newborn marsupials. The "larvae" eat and grow continuously until they secrete a mucous cocoon, from which a wholly normal-looking tropical bird emerges. Later forms have more specialized larvae, some which are skin-breathing and aquatic, while others are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandWorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandWorm">Sand Worm</a>-like predators.
<ul><li> The changelings' descendants the ornimorphs take this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. Instead of forming a cocoon, it gradually grows from a tadpole-like aquatic larva through amphibian- and reptile-like juvenile stages, before becoming arboreal, growing feathers, becoming first a glider and then a true flyer and eventually coming to resemble a mostly-typical bird.
</li><li> The placental birds are another group of changelings that pass their early larval stages inside the mother, attaching to the wall of the uterus and continuing much of its development within, until it's born live in a much more developed and independent state, often precocial at birth.
</li></ul></li><li> Bloons and Birdwhales are fully marine birds descended from pelican-like seabirds that have adapted to carry their eggs in their throat pouch. After millions of years of evolution this pouch has fully separated from the digestive system and become highly vascularised in order to provide heat and oxygen for the egg, effectivly becoming a pseudo uterus.
</li><li> The bumblets evolve the ability to give live birth by retaining their egg internally and oxygenating it by... flatulence.

While in the episode in question the biological parentage gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtraParentConception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtraParentConception">mixed up</a>, the <em>smizmar</em> is considered the "true" parent.

</li><li> Futurama plays with this trope a bit by having aliens be unaware of human reproduction. Human noses are harvested as an aphrodisiac under the incorrect assumption that the "human horn" is the main reproductive organ. Lrrr is surprised to discover that humans have a "lower horn" hidden in their pants.
</li><li> Even the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechanicalLifeforms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechanicalLifeforms">Mechanical Lifeforms</a> have a bit of this going on. The main difference between the "ill-defined robot sexes" is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots">the male has an antenna which transmits information used to create a baby robot, while the female has an internal drive that receives the transmission</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">So far, so analogous</a>, but <em>everything</em> about this process is treated as indistinguishable from the process it obviously resembles, which means that Bender having his antenna on the top of his head is exactly what it sounds like. (Females have antennae too, but without anatomical associations.)

When the Draags wish to reproduce, they go into a meditative trance, which causes a spherical forcefield bubble to form around a small representation of themselves which then float up into the sky toward their planet's moon. Upon reaching the moon, they land on gigantic, headless Greco-Roman statues, which proceed to dance the waltz (no, really, that's all they do). In all fairness, that could have just been foreplay — the Oms (humans) did sort of start destroying the statues mid-dance. Also, despite the Draags exhibiting sexual dimorphism (there are Draags with breasts and ones without), all Draags form pink bubbles and land on the female statues. The male statues have blue bubbles which are stated as coming from some other species "from other galaxies". It's implied in one of the history lessons that there have been Draags for longer than there has been meditation, so the entire thing may really just be literally foreplay with aliens before they actually reproduce amongst themselves.

<ul><li> Gems are manufactured from non-living minerals using special machinery, with the new gems literally popping out of a hole in the ground. The Classroom Gems short "How Are Gems Made?" elaborates on this procedure: the Gems <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornAsAnAdult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornAsAnAdult">pop out fully grown</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but the procedure also drains life from the soil and nearby plants and leaves the ground barren and withered</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansThroughAlienEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansThroughAlienEyes">Viewed from the opposite direction</a>, Rose Quartz found <em>humans</em> had bizarre reproduction methods, finding the idea of growing up so weird that she thought adult and child humans were different species.

<ul><li> Many of the above scenarios were based on the life cycles of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> organisms.
</li><li> Certain parasitic barnacles go through a ridiculous number of life stages, all radically different from another. Most notably, there is the <em>ypsigon</em>, a truly bizarre crustacean that resembles a barnacle larva and is superficially shrimp-like, but despite its common presence in seawater, the adult form has never been seen. Experiments in laboratories have attempted to force-metamorphose the y-cyprid stage using barnacle hormones, but instead of rooting itself in place and maturing into a sessile adult like a typical barnacle, the cyprid larva instead molted into essentially a <em>slug</em>, with no limbs, exoskeleton or digestive system of any sort and losing all resemblance to an arthropod. Unfortunately, all force-metamorphosed ypsigons die within days, so it still remains a mystery just <em>what</em> its final form would be like (though given the "slug" phase's lack of a digestive system, it's very likely a parasite of a yet-unknown host).
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitoid">Parasitoids<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> are species with a strange life cycle that involves putting their offspring in (for endoparasitoids) or on (for ectoparasitoids) a host organism. Parasitoids are strictly dependent on the host to survive and reproduce (like a parasite) and (almost) inevitably kill it (like a predator, though predators need to eat more than one prey animal throughout their lives). An example are <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichneumonoidea">Ichneumon wasps<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which typically use caterpillars as hosts. They inject their eggs into the hosts along with a polydnavirus that suppresses their immune systems to protect the eggs. The wasp larvae consume the least essential portions of the host's anatomy first, keeping it alive as long as possible. Once the larvae are mature, they emerge from the still living host and weave cocoons. Certain species produce mind-altering chemicals that causes the host caterpillar to guard and protect the cocoons until they hatch.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusociality">Eusocial insects<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> have a reproductive caste (which makes up a small proportion of the group) and a sterile worker caste (which makes up the majority).
<ul><li> In honeybees, sex is usually determined by males being haploid (one set of chromosomes) and females being diploid (two sets of chromosomes, like humans). Female larvae fed royal jelly become the reproductive "queen" caste, otherwise they become workers.
</li><li> In termites, all castes are split between male and female but, depending on the needs of the hive, can change caste. If any of the queens or kings in a colony dies, another will change to take their place.
</li><li> Eusociality isn't limited to insects, either. Naked mole rats are eusocial mammals.
</li></ul></li><li> As mentioned above, some insect species have haploid males and diploid females. For them, a mature female can reproduce without mating. The resulting offspring are always male.
</li><li> Prokaryotes physically merge when mating, in a process called <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_conjugation">bacterial conjugation.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Mating also has little, if anything, to do with reproduction; they reproduce asexually. As a result, traits and genes can jump species and ever across <em>kingdoms</em>. This is why the non-eukaryotic parts of the evolutionary tree are more like a tangle of roots.
<ul><li> Not just the prokaryotic parts either; some major clades of protists, such as ciliates, likewise reproduce through cell division but exchange genetic information with one another independently of this.
</li></ul></li><li> Plants <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternation_of_generations">alternate generations.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> In the case of flowering plants, the equivalent would be a human becoming pregnant, then having sex which fertilizes their fetus, and then the fetus gives birth to the offspring.
<ul><li> A similar process can be seen in aphids, which alternate generations between parthenogenic females and sexual reproduction.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jellyfish#Life_history_and_behavior">Jellyfish<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> basically have sexual reproduction producing larvae, which then settle down as a polyp, which in turn buds and produces new medusae asexually, and the cycle begins anew.
</li><li> Internal parasites, such as <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicrocoelium_dendriticum#Life_cycle">liver flukes,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> make <em>all</em> the above examples seem routine.
</li><li> The male anglerfish is tiny compared to the female. The sole purpose of the male in life is that once he gets the scent of a female, he swims to her and bites down on the side of the female. At the same time he excretes an enzyme at the mouth which causes it to physically fuse to the side of the female, and his body starts to atrophy. With time he is functionally reduced to a pair of balls hanging from the side which the female can use to impregnate herself when it is most convenient. When anglerfish were first studied, the males were thought to be a completely different parasitic species. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">Some females even have multiple males fused into them.</a>
</li><li> Subverted with most polygamous birds; the actual process of reproduction for them is strange from a mammalian standpoint, but also pretty vanilla, being just them touching their genitals together (a process appropriately and adorably referred to as a "cloaca kiss"). However, the ways the male attracts the female to mate with him can be <em>very</em> weird. Temminck's tragopan, for example, has a bright blue wattle that he expands and starts flailing about whilst making clicking noises. The frigatebird has an inflatable red throat pouch that he blows up like a balloon before warbling loudly to females that fly over him. The buff-breasted sandpiper displays his <em>armpit</em> (wingpit?) to the females. And perhaps the strangest example, the ruff bird often attracts females by essentially having <em>gay threesomes</em>. Yep, an entire species of birds wherein the females think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuyOnGuyIsHot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuyOnGuyIsHot">Guy-on-Guy Is Hot</a>.
</li><li> Because mating in water can be awkward if you have no grasping appendages and your spine isn't flexible enough to entwine around your partner, dolphins resort to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExoticEquipment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExoticEquipment">Exotic Equipment</a> to maintain a grip on their mates. Female dolphins' vaginal walls constrict to hold on, and males have a <em>prehensile penis</em> to cling to convolutions inside the birth canal. Both sexes occasionally use their genitals to grasp objects other than mates, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>-Centauri style: if you visit a Swim-With-Dolphins attraction, you can count on all the animals being females, because males have a bad habit of grabbing tourists' wrists or ankles with their you-know-whats.
</li><li> Many polychaete worms follow a mating strategy called epitoky, where entire segments of the worm transform into reproductive organs, which then detach from the worm and seek out other such segment to mate. Sylldiae worms, however, take this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">a step further:</a> their reproductive segments are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExoticEquipment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExoticEquipment">fully mobile,</a> and when they meet their counterparts, they friggin <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb">explode</a></em> in a blast of egg/sperm cells.
</li><li> Some invertebrates engage in a partly gruesome type of mating known, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">quite explicitly</a>, as "traumatic insemination", where the male will stab the female with a blade-like penis rather than through the conventional hole. This is the method in which bedbugs reproduce, and is indeed quite harmful to the female although it certainly discourages her from wanting to encounter other males soon.
</li><li> Some species of fruit flies have poisonous semen, and after mating (which, similar to bedbugs, may be traumatic insemination), the female will be less likely to seek out and mate with other males.
</li><li> In a few species of butterflies, the males will spray a pheromone on the female after mating with her that makes her smell like another male, so no other males will attempt to mate with her afterwards. This is actually beneficial for all parties, as repeated matings may disrupt the development of the eggs inside the female.
</li><li> <em>Neotrogla</em> is a genus of cave-dwelling barklice in which the normal genitalia and typical animal gender roles are swapped between sexes: the males are choosier and the females are more aggressive with mating, and the females have penises and males have vaginas. The female mounts the male and uses her spiky penis (or technically, a gynosome) to scoop semen out of the male's genital chamber, a process which takes <em>two to three days</em>.
</li><li> Many species of land-dwelling hermaphroditic gastropods have an organ known as a "dart sac", which contains arrow-like structures known as "love darts". Before two snails/slugs mate, they begin with a courtship dance that can last several hours and concludes with both parties attempting to spear their partner with a love dart. The dart is coated in a special mucus which increases sperm intake in the female sex organs, but are of considerable size (at up to three centimetres), and can be fired with such force it pierces <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice">right through the entire snail</a></em>.
</li><li> Most microorganisms have no gender and reproduce by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTheManHeUsedToBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTheManHeUsedToBe">splitting in two</a>. The cells that make up any multicellular do the same for the organism to grow.
