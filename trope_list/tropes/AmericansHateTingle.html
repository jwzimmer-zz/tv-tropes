</p><p>The most common reason for this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>, as things that seem normal or relatable in one culture can be seen as offensive, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries">baffling</a>, or just plain <em>stupid</em> in another. Aesthetic dissonance can also be at play, i.e. different cultures have their own standards of cuteness and attractiveness. Another reason for it can be that a character is supposed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainEthnic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainEthnic">represent the nation</a> that hates them, and this character is seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EthnicScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EthnicScrappy">offensively stereotypical</a>.

</p><p>When this is taken far enough (i.e. a work, or an entire genre, is rejected everywhere <em>except</em> its homeland), it can produce what's known as <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galapagos_syndrome">"Galápagos syndrome"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, in reference to the bizarre species that evolved in isolation on the Galápagos Islands that heavily informed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesDarwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesDarwin">Charles Darwin</a>'s theory of evolution by natural selection. The term was coined in Japan to describe their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CellPhone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CellPhone">Cell Phone</a> technology (<em>garakei</em>, from Galápagos and <em>keitai denwa</em>, the Japanese term for "mobile phone") and how it evolved on a completely separate track from that of the West, producing high-tech flip phones that could send and receive email, surf the web at 3G speeds, and play sophisticated games in a time when Western cell phones (apart from the BlackBerry, which was seen mostly as a business tool) were considered high-end if they could take pictures. They were the envy of the world in the 2000s, but due to lagging infrastructure outside Japan, they couldn't be exported, and so the Japanese cell phone industry ignored non-domestic markets almost entirely. As such, it was painfully slow to catch on to the smartphone revolution in the '10s, with foreign <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MacOS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MacOS">iPhones</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Google" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Google">Android</a> phones, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MicrosoftWindows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MicrosoftWindows">Windows</a> phones catching the <em>garakei</em> makers completely off-guard and snagging massive market share. The term has since been applied to other fields of Japanese technology, including its ATMs, its cars, and <a class="urllink" href="http://digitalchumps.com/gamingnews/318-latest-news/the-state-of-the-japanese-gaming-industry.html">its video games<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

<ul><li> A lot of Indian animated series tend to not be very well-liked outside of the country, usually due to the low quality of their animation, jokes, voice acting, etc. Case in point: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/MotuPatlu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/MotuPatlu">Motu Patlu</a></em> is one of the most popular kids' shows in its home country, but outside of India, it got several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">memes</a> made out of it, most likely due to it being considered mediocre.

<ul><li> While not exactly beloved in America, Neil Hamburger seems to be hated by British audiences, possibly because Jerry Sadowitz has been playing a similar character on the UK comedy circuit for years before. In his earlier American tours, Hamburger usually opened for rock bands or much bigger comedy acts. Which meant trouble in front of audiences who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody">didn't get the joke</a>. If you looked up reviews for the shows he opened up, chances are you'd see complaints about him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertoBenigni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertoBenigni">Roberto Benigni</a>'s show <em>Tutto Dante</em> was very popular in Italy. It had a very lukewarm reception when performed in Paris, not helped by the fact that Benigni kept performing it in Italian <em>without subtitles</em>, so non-Italian speaking audiences were left without a clue of what's going on.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AlphaFlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AlphaFlight">Alpha Flight</a></em> never became popular in Canada, where the team is supposed to originate from. This might be because the characters seem to have been inspired by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh">stereotypes</a> of Canadians. Which is ironic when you realize the team was created by Canadian artist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnByrne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnByrne">John Byrne</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin">Tintin</a>:</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">Universally popular, even in places you might not expect like Africa, the Middle East, China</a>,... Except in North America, especially the USA, where it is still more a cult strip. Case in point is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>'s 2011 movie adaptation, which was a box office success across the world, except in the United States where the media attention and public interest were very low.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix">Asterix</a></em>: Very popular in Europe, where the time period of the comic (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientRome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientRome">Ancient Rome</a>) is more prominent in the culture, architecture, and landscape. Still, it has been universally translated and sold. Only in Japan and in the US it never caught on (you can find the comics pretty easily in the US; just don't expect anyone else to be familiar with it unless they're a Europhile). It's more popular in Canada (which has stronger European, especially French, cultural connections) but still isn't anywhere near mainstream (except in Québec).
<ul><li> Part of the reason might be that a lot of jokes in the comics are commentaries on culture and modern life, which are way easier to understand for Europeans, e.g. the running gag that fish sold in a coastal village is delivered from the antique equivalent of Paris.
</li><li> Another big part is that a lot of the humour is based around transplanting modern stereotypes about European countries to their historical equivalents - jokes about Belgian tribesman eating mayonnaise and Corsicans having switchblade swords are funny if you're a continental European, but nonsensical if you're American. Even nations that Americans do have stereotypes about (France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Spain, Scotland) get treated from the French point of view, or from an unusual angle to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny">making jokes Goscinny thought would be considered more offensive than playful</a>. <em>Asterix</em> dealt with American stereotypes in <em>Asterix Conquers America</em>, where the added racial elements of having Native Americans act in stereotypical ways come off as just not funny to American readers (the jokes were heavily reworked for the film version to avoid alienating American audiences); <em>Asterix and The Falling Sky</em> has likewise been seen as horrendously racist against the Japanese.
</li><li> Europeans have a long history of stereotyping and making fun of each other, and such humour is not considered particularly offensive in Europe so long as you're not referencing old wars or making fun of genocide. In America, a melting pot where immigrants from various European countries attempted to keep a personal cultural identity while living with others doing the same, many experiencing serious class oppression due to coming from the wrong 'old country', it comes off as much more mean-spirited.
</li><li> The crows'-nest pirate was recognised by the comics' original French audience as a parody of a character from a serious pirate <em>bandes dessinée</em>, so his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackface" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackface">caricatured features</a> were a way of swiping at comic books taking themselves too seriously.

</li></ul></li><li> Allegedly, one of the major reasons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan">Iron Man</a> is usually given leadership of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a> in TV adaptations (such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes">The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes!</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvengersAssemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvengersAssemble">Avengers, Assemble!</a></em>) is because focus group data indicated that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> (the traditional leader of the Avengers) is extremely unpopular in countries like the United Kingdom. Downplayed with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheFirstAvenger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheFirstAvenger">Captain America: The First Avenger</a></em> — although international markets were offered the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarketBasedTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarketBasedTitle">alternate title</a> "The First Avenger", only three nations opted for the other title, and most of its box office was international (it probably helps that the MCU's version of Captain America is often the butt of jokes for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor">Patriotic Fervor</a> and occasional lameness, like scolding Iron Man for swearing).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DeKiekeboes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DeKiekeboes">De Kiekeboes</a></em> is a cultural phenomenon in Flanders and even in Wallonia, it has gained somewhat of a following (something that is rare for a non-Dupuis comic). In the Netherlands, it is one of the most obscure comic books ever made. This is a diversion from the norm as other comic books by <em>De Standaard</em> (such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuskeEnWiske" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuskeEnWiske">Suske en Wiske</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Nero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Nero">Nero</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Urbanus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Urbanus">Urbanus</a></em>), while not always blockbusters, are still very recognizable names in the Dutch community.
</li><li> In 1905, a French newspaper began publishing a comic strip about a young housemaid called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Becassine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Becassine">Bécassine</a>. This strip was popular across most of France and is widely considered to be the founding of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrancoBelgianComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrancoBelgianComics">bande dessinée</a> (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBook">Comic Book</a> tradition of France and Belgium that gave us the aforementioned <em>Tintin</em>, <em>Astérix</em>, and <em>De Kiekeboes</em>). However, it was deeply unpopular in one region of France: Brittany. You see, Bécassine was supposed to be Breton, but she didn't really act like a Breton woman; where the portrayal of her wasn't stereotypical, it was ludicrously off-the-mark. The comic ended up being so hated in Brittany that when a Breton man in Paris saw a giant statue of her, he destroyed it.

In America, however, the movie was widely panned by critics, who saw the movie (and its characters) ripping off from other animated films. The movie's also a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb">Box Office Bomb</a> that barely made any money during its opening weekend.

Many explanations have been raised; the less imaginative is that not many people there had seen the other two films because of economic troubles right after the fall of Communism in the 1990s, resulting in <em>3</em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityPorn">Continuity Porn</a> lacking appeal.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013">Frozen</a></em> was badly received by Norwegian critics and got very poor initial reviews there, with the general consensus being that of "generic plot and characters" and "forced and obnoxious musical numbers", while one particular review criticized the setting for "not really looking like Norway". It did better in smaller magazines, though, and ended up becoming <a class="urllink" href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/norway/yearly/?yr=2013&amp;p=.htm">the third biggest film of 2013<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the country. It's further exacerbated with the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/2014/09/17/disneys-frozen-ride-controversy/">news<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that Disney is replacing the Norway-themed Epcot ride "Maelstrom" with a Frozen-themed ride. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">Park purists and Norwegians</a> are pretty unhappy that their former ride meant to honor Norway is being replaced with a new ride based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013">Frozen</a></em> and Arendelle.

It was so hated that the short was removed just a week after release. A big factor of this was because <em>Olaf</em> wasn't actually a short, but a 20-minute Made-For-TV special that, according to Disney, was put in because they felt the short was "too cinematic" for TV. A few people have suggested, though, that it was put in as an attempt to lessen a blow of this trope elsewhere.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicRoundabout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicRoundabout">Doogal</a></em> is probably one of the most notorious examples of this in animated film history. Based on the British-French stop-motion children's show from the '60s, the CGI film was originally released in Europe in 2005. Even though the original series and franchise is practically unknown outside of its native France, Harvey Weinstein himself after watching the original film felt it would be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">brilliant idea</a> to release the film in America in 2006. This was done by recasting all but two of the original British cast with well-known American stars, rewriting the film by inserting obnoxious pop culture and fart jokes and reediting the film to accommodate all the script changes. The results turned <em>Doogal</em> into a critical and commercial nightmare in the United States, continuing to baffle and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BileFascination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BileFascination">intrigue</a> film enthusiasts and critics to this day.

</li><li> Historically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero">Superhero</a> movies had a reputation for underperforming outside of the U.S. However, the box office successes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises">The Dark Knight Rises</a></em> began to turn this trend around. Since 2012, the only superhero movies to make more money domestically than internationally have been <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WonderWoman2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WonderWoman2017">Wonder Woman (2017)</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther2018">Black Panther (2018)</a></em>, and even then, it was mainly because both films did <em>extraordinarily</em> well in the U.S., with the latter becoming the highest grossing superhero movie of all time domestically until it was surpassed by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame">Avengers: Endgame</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> movies <em>still</em> have problems turning in decent box office numbers in Japan, as the first Batman media brought to Japan was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966">the old campy Adam West TV series</a> and thus this became the Japanese mainstream's first impression of him. Later movies, like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989">Batman (1989)</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherNolan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherNolan">Christopher Nolan</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy">trilogy</a>, which depict darker, more serious stories, mostly confused Japanese audiences expecting to see colorful camp. Surprisingly however, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Joker2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Joker2019">Joker (2019)</a></em>, was a success in Japan, grossing over $46 million.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989">Batman (1989)</a></em> was a flop in Norway. After three weeks in theaters, it was removed, even though the movie got a lot of advertising in the country.
</li></ul></li><li> Superhero movies altogether have a relative niche appeal in Japan. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame">Avengers: Endgame</a></em> is the highest grossing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> movie in that country, and that movie didn't gross more than $52 million. <a class="urllink" href="https://kotaku.com/a-theory-why-marvel-movies-dont-dominate-japan-1835115836">Some journalists<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> suggest that American superhero movies star middle-aged adults who don't fit the mold of the teenage and young adult heroes so prevalent in Japanese media. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> movies are the rare exception largely because of how Peter Parker is younger everyman who resonates more with Japanese audiences. Most notably, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManFarFromHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManFarFromHome">Spider-Man: Far From Home</a></em> is the highest grossing solo MCU movie in Japan and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManTrilogy">Spider-Man Trilogy</a></em>, which pulled particularly above-average numbers in Japan even without adjusting for inflation.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron">Avengers: Age of Ultron</a></em> caught flak in Eastern European countries for the portrayal of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania">Sokovia</a>. The random mishmash of shallow (exaggerated accents, tracksuits, names that varied from German to Italian to Polish to Romanian), offensive (Pietro stealing a dress to impress a girl) or misplaced (Soviet fur hats in a country modelled after former Yugoslavia) stereotypes were seen as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeParkVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeParkVersion">Theme Park Version</a> which should have stayed in the comics and shouldn't appear in an age where information is a click away. The role it had as a throwaway place to be wrecked, and the general disregard toward anything related to the place ("nowhere important on the way to everywhere important") and even its location wildly varying within a single <em>panning shot</em> of a map in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar">Captain America: Civil War</a></em>) also didn't go unnoticed. It doesn't help that "important" nations such as Germany and Russia in the same movies weren't replaced by fictional stand-ins.
</li></ul></li><li> As beloved as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> may be around the world, there are two notable films that aren't well received outside of Britain.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieAnotherDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieAnotherDay">Die Another Day</a></em> is hated both North and South Korea. The North Koreans weren't amused for making the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed">pastiche of Kim Jong Il</a>. The South Koreans were outraged by the fact that their defense forces were ordered by Americans and that the theatrical cut included a love scene near a statue of the Buddha.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre">Spectre</a></em> was extremely successful in its native UK<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note45kbl');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note45kbl" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note45kbl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">though it still caught flak from some Classic Bond fans who felt, among other things, that the rebooted Blofeld was a great disappointment compared to the classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldPleasence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldPleasence">Donald Pleasence</a> portrayal</span> but received a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">mixed reception</a> in the US. Some American critics disliked how the film tried to tie together the events of the previous Daniel Craig movies, making it seem like a poor attempt to form a cinematic universe. Likewise, they also criticized <em>Spectre</em> for lacking originality since it blatantly copied ideas from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier">Captain America: The Winter Soldier</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MissionImpossibleRogueNation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MissionImpossibleRogueNation">Mission: Impossible  Rogue Nation</a></em>, and previous Bond movies. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticProof" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticProof">Not that their opinions stopped the movie from grossing over $200 million in the US</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Argo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Argo">Argo</a></em> was a major box office success in the U.S. and won the Academy Award for Best Picture but was not well-liked in Canada, Britain, or New Zealand for minimizing the work of those countries' embassies to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericaSavesTheDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericaSavesTheDay">make the Americans out to be the sole heroes of the rescue</a>. The film even got such a poor reception at the Toronto Film Festival that director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenAffleck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenAffleck">Ben Affleck</a> had to go back and recut some of the film (less than a month before opening) to give a fairer portrayal of the Canadians.
</li><li> The makers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Braveheart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Braveheart">Braveheart</a></em> were very nearly <em>sued</em> by the Scottish government over its depiction of national hero Robert the Bruce (even though he really did waffle back and forth on the conflict several times). The movie is generally regarded with varying degrees of embarrassment and annoyance in Scotland. It's even less popular in England, which isn't surprising since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilBrit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilBrit">literally every named English character in the movie is evil.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla2014">Godzilla (2014)</a></em>:
<ul><li> While this is easily averted for the film itself in the Japanese market (Toho themselves heaped praise upon the movie), it's played straight with Godzilla's redesign, which a decent portion of the audience over there consider to be weaker, or, for some people, fatter, than the original.
</li><li> The movie has gotten a pretty bad rep in places where <em>Godzilla</em> hasn't been established as a pop-culturally relevant franchise, and so most people have grown up with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1998">previous American reboot</a> instead. Being that one of the main focuses of the film was to approach it from a "fan perspective" and distance it as much as possible from the '98 movie, it's easy to see why this strategy backfired in places where audiences harbored no love for the Japanese Godzilla, especially since reviews agreed that its faithfulness to the source material was one of the movie's main selling points. Basically, the two movies' receptions are inverted compared to countries where the brand has had a history.
</li><li> The film did really poorly in the South Korean market. Box office analysts have compared the South Korean market for this movie with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PacificRim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PacificRim">Pacific Rim</a></em> and noticed how it was an unusual outlier considering <em>Godzilla</em> did better than <em>Pacific Rim</em> in every other territory.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaKingOfTheMonsters2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaKingOfTheMonsters2019">2019 sequel</a> showed an even stronger regional divide. It underperformed in most of the world, bringing back less than half or less than a third of the original's audience, depending on the country. Many reasons have been thrown around, ranging from competition with other blockbuster films, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysSpoil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysSpoil">overly spoiler-heavy advertisements</a> to viewers feeling disillusioned over the first film's subversive nature and Godzilla just not being a popular brand name. But the movie was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">reasonably successful</a> in Japan and China, who helped push it out of total flop territory.
</li><li> The entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">brand</a> qualifies. Although it had a rough history even in its native country, it's considered a cultural and commercial mainstay that still produces <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShinGodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShinGodzilla">successful films</a> every now and then. <em>Godzilla</em> movies have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">cult following in the United States</a> as well, and they have their share of fans in other territories too, such as Germany (one thing these two places have in common is that they released classic Japanese monster films back when they were still relevant and there weren't a whole lot of Western effects-films to give them competition, which means there's a lot of nostalgia for them). In the rest of the world, it's mostly the American adaptations that got any lasting attention (with a few people also recognizing the significance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1954" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1954">the original</a>), whereas the other ~30 films are pretty much seen as the epitome of low-grade schlock due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">lack of</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadExportForYou">or terrible exports</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> is also in effect, since most audiences find the characterful and fantastical Japanese monsters unappealing and silly, especially combined with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManInARubberSuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManInARubberSuit">rubber suit effects</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Bollywood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Bollywood">Bollywood</a> film <em>Gunday</em> is a footnote in most of the world, did well enough in its home country of India, and got okay critical reviews. In Bangladesh, it's generally viewed to be worse than Hitler, for some major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory">Artistic License  History</a> taken with the Bangladesh Liberation War in a brief prologue sequence. The film was actually rated #1 on the IMDB Bottom 100 for about a year, for exactly this reason, with thousands of angry Bengalis one-starring the film for that prologue.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnQ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnQ">John Q.</a></em> did alright in the US (i.e. covered its cost and made the equivalent of it again), but hardly raised interest overseas. Almost every foreign critic began his review of the film with the statement that, for better or worse, the premise of a man taking an ER at gunpoint after being denied life-saving surgery was something that could only happen in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland">American movie</a>.
</li><li> The Holocaust documentary <em>'<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shoah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shoah">Shoah</a></em> was critically acclaimed almost everywhere, winning several "best documentary of the year" awards and being voted #2 of all time by <em>Sight and Sound.</em> In Poland, however, the movie is utterly loathed, including by the Central Polish-Jewish Committee who <a class="urllink" href="http://wyborcza.pl/1,76842,7694169,25_lat_sporow_o__Shoah_.html">filed a letter of protest<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with the French Embassy in Warsaw in response to the film. It was never going to be popular, considering it's about Poland's assisting in the Holocaust. But the film's refusal to acknowledge the many Poles, who <em>did</em> save Jews <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note516pm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note516pm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note516pm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There were far more Polish Righteous Among Nations (gentiles who helped Jews) <a class="urllink" href="https://www.ushmm.org/information/press/press-releases/collaboration-and-complicity-during-the-holocaust">than any other nationality in the world.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Despite the fact that Poland was the one country where the Nazis order the death penalty for anyone helping Jews. </span> or who suffered ethnic persecution under the Nazi regime, was a pretty heavy nail in the coffin of Poles ever appreciating the film.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges">The Three Stooges</a>: In the U.S., they are an institution. Broadcast for decades and very popular with all ages to the point that almost every American comedy will have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeStoogesShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeStoogesShoutOut">Three Stooges Shout-Out</a> at one point. In the rest of the world, especially Europe, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurelAndHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurelAndHardy">Laurel and Hardy</a> have always been far more famous and popular. A major reason for this is that Laurel &amp; Hardy lost their popularity in the U.S. during the 1940s because the quality of their movies went down due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6w92v');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6w92v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6w92v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> This is also the reason why Laurel &amp; Hardy's movies of the 1920s and 1930s are the only ones still shown on television </span> although they still made millions, and they stopped producing new movies ca. 1945, except for <em>Atoll K</em> (1950), which due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a> ended up as a very undignified finale for the duo. Newcomers such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AbbottAndCostello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AbbottAndCostello">Abbott and Costello</a>, The Three Stooges, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BobHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BobHope">Bob Hope</a> took their crown as a result. Meanwhile, in Europe, where the Nazi occupation had cut off the import of Hollywood movies, the new acts did not even get a proper chance to make an impact before VE Day. Laurel and Hardy on the other hand almost immediately started touring through Europe with a small stage show, getting back in contact with their old fans and continued to do so until 1954. As a result, Europeans were far more interested in Laurel &amp; Hardy than any of the comedians they never heard about. It didn't help that comedians like Abbott and Costello and Bob Hope lacked the charm of Laurel &amp; Hardy and their comedy was mostly verbal, which translated badly in non-English countries. While the Three Stooges did rely more on slapstick comedy, many Europeans have always felt it was too lowbrow and unsophisticated compared to Laurel &amp; Hardy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheMarxBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheMarxBrothers">The Marx Brothers</a>. Though the Marx Brothers' comedy is also very verbal they had a few good foreign dubs at the time, especially in Italy where they have always been very beloved. Harpo was also a link with silent comedy, which crossed all language barriers. And much like Laurel &amp; Hardy, the lesser Marx Brothers movies of the 1940s were never seen by Europeans during the Nazi occupation, thus their reputation also remained intact.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSoundOfMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSoundOfMusic">The Sound of Music</a></em> is one of the most popular musicals of all time... except in Germany and Austria. Most people in both countries have never watched the movie and those that have seen it despise it.
</li><li> As noted in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/can-til-schweiger-beat-germanys-816751">this article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>, Germany is a notoriously poor market for action movies. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TilSchweiger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TilSchweiger">Til Schweiger</a>, the nation's biggest movie star, is known outside Germany for films like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InglouriousBasterds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InglouriousBasterds">Inglourious Basterds</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LaraCroftTombRaiderTheCradleOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LaraCroftTombRaiderTheCradleOfLife">Lara Croft: Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life</a></em>, but audiences back home know him for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticComedy">romantic comedies</a>. German action filmmakers like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RolandEmmerich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RolandEmmerich">Roland Emmerich</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WolfgangPetersen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WolfgangPetersen">Wolfgang Petersen</a> often have to leave for Hollywood to get recognition.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrNobody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrNobody">Mr. Nobody</a></em> was a hit in Belgium, where it grossed nearly one million dollars, which is rather high for a Belgian box office and loved by critics, who still to this day think that it is the best Belgian film ever made. In France, the response was more mixed by critics, but it nevertheless managed to gross 1 million dollars there as well. In the United States, it also had a mixed critical response, but it only managed to gross $3600 there, which makes it a candidate for the award of "lowest grossing film in the U.S. as of 2013".
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PacificRim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PacificRim">Pacific Rim</a></em> was a modest hit in the U.S. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">but much more popular throughout most of Asia and Oceanic areas</a>), the film did poorly in Europe, partly because most of the action happens only by the Pacific Rim. The U.K. (due to highly-respected actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IdrisElba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IdrisElba">Idris Elba</a> playing one of the main characters) and Russia (due to the popularity of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">the couple that pilot</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Cherno Alpha</a></em>, and that Russia is the only European country with a Pacific coast) are exceptions to the rule. Ironically, the movie did not do well in Japan either, despite being a love letter to the Kaiju and Mecha genres.

Once they market researched the idea in China, they scrapped the project because big budget movies almost have to open in China to make their money back these days and it just wasn't worth the risk to sink that much money into it. </span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a></em> was as divisive in China as it is in America. Not only did the movie suffer from a 77% weekend drop (compared to the 69% drop domestically) but it was also trashed by a number of bloggers and professional critics with some describing the film as "intellectually insulting" and compared it to "facial paralysis". Much of the backlash stems from the misleading marketing as audiences expected a straightforward action-packed popcorn movie only to learn that the film is overstuffed with subplots and plays out more like a political thriller. Furthermore, many of the heavy-handed Christian symbolism and references to classical humanities were lost on Chinese audiences, many of whom aren't familiar with such concepts and ideas.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shazam2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shazam2019">SHAZAM!</a></em> also similarly failed to catch on in the normally superhero loving Chinese market. According to reviews on their IMDB equivalent, Douban, where it has a pretty terrible score of 6.9/10, the story didn't translate well culturally. In a society that reveres its elders, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledButCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledButCute">Troubled, but Cute</a> protagonist Billy came off as a brat for disrespecting his foster parents. There's also not really an equivalent of growing up in a foster home there. It is also a bit more lower stakes than other superhero movies and spectacle translates better than a "talky", very American humor-filled movie with less action than its genre peers. Its $43 million performance is especially terrible compared to its immediate predecessor in the franchise, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aquaman2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aquaman2018">Aquaman</a></em>. With its spectacle and universally understood story of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace">King Arthur underwater</a> snagged a 7.6 <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8xl5l');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8xl5l" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8xl5l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> It was in the mid 9s upon release </span> on Douban and almost $300 million at the Chinese box office.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieChan">Jackie Chan</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">beloved throughout the West</a>, and sells well within China. However, he has become <em>rather</em> unpopular in Taiwan (and even to an extent his own home town, Hong Kong), due to very pro-Mainland opinions. During some of his publicity tours, he has repeatedly praised Beijing's leadership, suggested that Taiwan be returned to mainland Chinese rule, and even accused democracy of leading to only protest and problems.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens">The Force Awakens</a></em> made some headlines for fizzling out in a number of foreign markets. Its domestic box office is the highest ever, but in non-English-speaking markets, its performance was fairly average<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9qd4u');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9qd4u" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9qd4u');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">with the notable exception of France, in which it has outgrossed every Marvel Cinematic universe movie to date</span> and didn't exactly break any records. Some analysts believe that this resulted from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityLockout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityLockout">story that wasn't accessible to newcomers</a> and the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny">other Star Wars imitators had already stolen its thunder</a>. For example, it did middling business in Japan<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10dpj9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10dpj9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10dpj9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It didn't do badly by any means, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnedByFaintPraise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnedByFaintPraise">it just wasn't the record breaker that it was in the US</a></span>, largely due to coming out the same time as the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YoKaiWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YoKaiWatch">Yo Kai Watch</a></em> film. This has rankled many fans, due to <em>Yo-Kai Watch</em> being an example of this itself in both anime and video games.
</li><li> The same was true with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RogueOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RogueOne">Rogue One</a></em> and <em>especially</em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi">The Last Jedi</a></em>, which both landed with a thud in China despite being smash hits in the US, the latter having the second highest-grossing opening weekend in the history of the American box-office at the time of its release. <em>The Last Jedi</em> in particular was eviscerated by both audiences and critics alike, with the most upvoted review on popular aggregator Douban (China's own Rotten Tomatoes) calling it "an insult to intelligence" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">not that there aren't plenty of people in the rest of the world who would agree</a>). It was <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sixthtone.com/news/1001531/chinas-die-hard-star-wars-fans-respond-to-last-jedi-flop">noted<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that <em>Star Wars</em> in general just does not appeal to Chinese audiences, especially with the earlier films having never been released there, the franchise being only a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic">niche property</a> in that country. It got to the point that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Solo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Solo">Solo</a></em> got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarketBasedTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarketBasedTitle">Market-Based Title</a> change to "Ranger Solo" to downplay any <em>Star Wars</em> connection. It didn't work.
</li><li> The franchise isn't popular in India either. In general, most Hollywood films struggle in India due to competition from local movies and state-imposed restrictions. Just like in China, the Indian melodrama and pop-culture cinema still uses many of the melodramatic and epic tropes that <em>Star Wars</em> repackaged in science-fiction dressing, thereby removing most of its freshness for the Western audience. It's rather notable that among Indian movie audiences, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord">Harrison Ford</a> is more well known for his turn in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AirForceOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AirForceOne">Air Force One</a></em> than as Han Solo.
</li></ul></li><li> In general, sci-fi space stories almost always flop in China. <em>The Last Jedi</em> was the biggest box office bomb of 2017 in China, but the second-biggest one happens to be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ValerianAndTheCityOfAThousandPlanets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ValerianAndTheCityOfAThousandPlanets">Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets</a></em>, the year's other high-profile movie set in space. No one is entirely sure why, not even the Chinese, although possible explanations range from the futuristic feel of space being anathema to the traditions-focused culture of China to the country's lack of any major space programs (<em>Dongfanghong 1</em> and <em>Jade Rabbit</em> notwithstanding, both of which had more attention from other countries than China) resulting in a lack of interest in outer space among the Chinese as a whole.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EnemyAtTheGates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EnemyAtTheGates">Enemy at the Gates</a></em>: Russian audiences hate this movie, and two successive Russian Culture Ministers along with the Russian Military Historical Society have classified this movie as "deliberately anti-Russian propaganda". The main reasons for that are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">weird behaviours of various characters</a>, the fact that Russians consider this movie too lighthearted and how they feel the Red Army is depicted as evil and incompetent (a general problem Russians have with Western-made productions about them).
</li><li> While much of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulVerhoeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulVerhoeven">Paul Verhoeven</a>'s Hollywood works are beloved in America, with many of them seen as the epitome of satirical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn">Gorn-fest</a> action movies, his homeland-made films are practically unknown outside of the Netherlands (and Europe to an extent). Even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zwartboek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zwartboek">Zwartboek</a></em>, his first return to Dutch cinema in nearly two decades, performed exceptionally well back in the Netherlands, but barely made a blip in North America. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> also plays a role, due to a large amount of sex and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleFrontalNudity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleFrontalNudity">Male Frontal Nudity</a> in his Dutch films, which would earn an NC-17 rating in America. (Especially since one of his American movies, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Showgirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Showgirls">Showgirls</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreKiller">ended up killing the NC-17 rating in America</a>.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDayAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDayAfter">The Day After</a></em> is well-known and loved in the US (in no small part due to its role in helping end the Cold War), but when it was released theatrically in Europe it got hit with a lot of flak for supposedly downplaying the horrors of nuclear war. So much so that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Threads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Threads">Threads</a></em> was made in response. The reason for this is likely because Europeans didn't know that <em>The Day After</em> originally aired on television, meaning it had to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">watered down to pass network censorship standards</a> (a fact that's even lampshaded at the end of the film).
</li><li> While already a polarizing franchise in most countries, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Descendants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Descendants">Descendants</a></em> was a complete flop in Australia. This comes from one of the central premises of families being banished to an island ghetto with no access to modern technology or decent food for committing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual">any sort of crime</a>, and having their children be shunned and mistreated by those in Auradon for the sole reason of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinsOfOurFathers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinsOfOurFathers">being related to them</a>. Australia's early history <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SentencedToDownUnder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SentencedToDownUnder">was very similar</a>, but their descendants pride themselves on their convict history, and some settlements have no connections to convicts (e.g. Adelaide). Seeing children being subjected to extreme racism because of their parents' crimes is just too hard to swallow for many Australians, and even its Disney Channel hardly shows the film and its two sequels. It doesn't help that Australia has its <em>own</em> Isle of the Lost in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nauru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nauru">Nauru</a>, where children have been locked up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CrazyRichAsians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CrazyRichAsians">Crazy Rich Asians</a></em> is a box office success worldwide and received critical acclaim which many, particularly Asian-Americans, considered it a movement for diversity due to the entire cast being Asian. However, China and Japan are not too crazy about it because they are already used to seeing an all-Asian cast in their media and the film's premise of a middle-class woman entering the elite society of her rich boyfriend is nothing new to them. For the Japanese audiences' case, the lack of well-known Hollywood actors didn't get their attention while for the mainland Chinese, they dislike the Western interpretation of their culture which is considered bland or cliche.
</li><li> If the reception of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hellboy2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hellboy2019">Hellboy (2019)</a></em> is already divisive in its native U.S., the reception outside America is even worse, being the most notable case Mexico, partly because being the home of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GuillermoDelToro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GuillermoDelToro">Guillermo del Toro</a>, the director of the previous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hellboy2004" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hellboy2004">two</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HellboyIITheGoldenArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HellboyIITheGoldenArmy">films</a>, which for obvious reasons both him and his films are deeply revered there, and also because the film was defeated in box office by a local Mexican film, (<em>No Manches, Frida 2</em>) something that's rather unusual there. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0b0uv');"><sup>Explanation </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0b0uv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0b0uv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">With some very venerable exceptions, most Mexican films since the end of the golden era of Mexican cinema (1920s to 1960s) rarely were able to compete, much less lead, the local box office against either Hollywood or other foreign films, partly because of either lack of advertising or because most of these films past the 1960s were terrible shlockfests unable to even make a earning, and while the Mexican movie industry did managed to do very good films at later 1990s, most Mexican films were and are still unable to compete against foreign productions. The fact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalCringe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalCringe">Cultural Cringe</a> is prevalent in Mexican culture doesn't help.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hostel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hostel">Hostel</a></em> got absolutely slated by Czech and Slovakian critics and audiences, which is understandable given how the region is inaccurately portrayed in the film as a poverty-stricken, crime-ridden hellhole permanently stuck in the 1980s.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay">Independence Day</a></em> has a fairly large fanbase in its native United States, but in basically every other country, it's unpopular due to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericaSavesTheDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericaSavesTheDay">incredibly exaggerated nationalistic themes</a>, which doesn't exactly travel well to other nations. However, nonetheless, both the film and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDayResurgence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDayResurgence">its sequel</a> made the majority of their box office revenue overseas, suggesting there's <em>some</em> international audience for it.
</li><li> Although <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoungEinstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoungEinstein">Young Einstein</a></em> was generally well-received in its native Australia, the reaction from North American critics was mostly negative. This has largely been attributed to its style of humour not translating well overseas.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Revolution1985" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Revolution1985">Revolution (1985)</a></em> got negative reviews in most countries, but American critics were especially harsh to it. To wit, it's a historical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicMovie">Epic Movie</a> about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">The American Revolution</a>... <em>made by British filmmakers</em>, meaning that its very non-idealized portrait of the Revolution (despite it being told from the colonials' point of view) stood out that much more. The general reaction among Americans was that Goldcrest Films should have just stayed away from the subject, or at least written off the idea of this film making any money in the US.
</li><li> In the US, the film adaptation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnGrisham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnGrisham">John Grisham</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ATimeToKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ATimeToKill">A Time to Kill</a></em> got good reviews, was a solid box-office hit, and won an NAACP Image Award. In Europe, on the other hand, reviews were far more negative, with critics seeing its plot (about a white lawyer defending a black <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan">vigilante</a> who murdered his ten-year-old daughter's white rapists) as glorifying violence and extrajudicial murder and some going so far as to call it borderline fascist. French critics in particular were downright <a class="urllink" href="https://www.cracked.com/article_28650_the-wikipedia-page-a-time-to-kill-hides-bonkers-controversy.html">scathing,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with Didier Péron, the critic for the newspaper <em>Libération</em>, saying that the film "militates in favour of the black cause only to legitimize... the mentally ill gesture of the avenging father", and the French branch of Amnesty International calling the film disturbing. The French release even had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestioningTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestioningTitle">question mark added to the end of the title</a> (<em>Le Droit de tuer?</em>) in order to make the film's morality seem more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality">ambiguous</a> than it was. A lot of the controversy came down to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> over the morality of the death penalty; while Americans at the time of the film's release were overwhelmingly in favor of it (support reached an all-time high at 80% in 1994, just two years before the film came out), it is banned and extremely unpopular in most of Europe, where it is seen as a violation of human rights.

It is considered very distasteful because the name of Vlad III (The Impaler) Dracula, who is celebrated to this day as a hero for the cause of defending the independence of Wallachia (one of the predecessor states of Romania) from the invading Ottomans during the fifteenth century (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">even if it meant taking some brutal methods to so</a>), was used for that of the bloodthirsty, habitual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>-crossing monster. To put this another way, if a writer from another country were to write a novel featuring an American serial killer named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> or a British murderer named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill">Winston Churchill</a>, that would not be taken kindly by citizens of those respective nations. Granted, even though the Romanians' loathing for Bram Stoker's <em>Dracula</em> has ameliorated over the decades, and they have even been willing to capitalize on the fictional Count Dracula's association with the country by selling vampire-related souvenirs, it is still not wise to talk about <em>Dracula</em> or Bram Stoker at length with any random Romanian on the streets. Which is rather ironic since despite being based on the historical Vlad, the actual character is supposed to be Hungarian of Székely descent instead of Romanian as Transylvania would not be Romanian territory until World War I and the fictional Dracula feels very strongly towards his ethnic roots.

It was well-received in the US and its native UK, where it was seen as a welcome change from the traditional view of Quisling. Most Norwegians, on the other hand, hated it — they did not appreciate being vilified and saw the portrayal of Quisling as an attempt to whitewash the most infamous traitor in the history of their country. Its accuracy was criticized by figures from occupation-era Norway, with several outright calling it a falsification of history. One of them, Sverre Løberg, was sued for slander by its Norwegian translator... and ended up acquitted.

<ul><li> Due to differences in attitudes as opposed to the source material of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> has some elements that don't gel with American audiences:
<ul><li> The general rule is that <em>Super Sentai</em> works best while being silly, and <em>Power Rangers</em> works best when being serious. For this reason, the serious <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChourikiSentaiOhranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChourikiSentaiOhranger">Chouriki Sentai Ohranger</a></em> caused <em>Super Sentai</em>'s popularity to take a bit of a dive; but the silly <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GekisouSentaiCarranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GekisouSentaiCarranger">Gekisou Sentai Carranger</a></em> managed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinBackTheCrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinBackTheCrowd">Win Back the Crowd</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1107mt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1107mt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1107mt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The theory that <em>Ohranger</em> almost ended <em>Sentai</em> has been proven to be false. It was in fact <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChikyuuSentaiFiveman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChikyuuSentaiFiveman">Chikyuu Sentai Fiveman</a></em> that almost got <em>Sentai</em> cancelled and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChoujinSentaiJetman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChoujinSentaiJetman">Choujin Sentai Jetman</a></em> was originally intended to be the final season.</span> Inversely, when <em>Ohranger</em> was adapted into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersZeo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersZeo">Power Rangers Zeo</a></em>, it was and is a season that is well-regarded among <em>Power Rangers</em> fans; while when <em>Carranger</em> was adapted into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo">Power Rangers Turbo</a></em>, ratings got so low that the creators decided <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFauxnale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFauxnale">to wrap up the series</a> on a lower budget the following year. But <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace">Power Rangers in Space</a></em>, at the time the darkest and most serious season, was so popular that <em>Power Rangers</em> got renewed and is still going.
</li><li> Villains also get different treatment. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyukyuSentaiGoGoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyukyuSentaiGoGoV">Kyukyu Sentai GoGoV</a></em> had villainess Denus, who is well-regarded in Sentai fandom. When it was adapted into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLightspeedRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLightspeedRescue">Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue</a></em>, her equivalent, Vypra, was hated by fans, thanks in no small part to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XPacHeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XPacHeat">X-Pac Heat</a> leveled against Jennifer Yen. It got to the point where Linkara, in his review for his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/HistoryOfPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/HistoryOfPowerRangers">History of Power Rangers</a></em> series, all but cheered when Vypra was absorbed into Queen Bansheera later in the season.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KaizokuSentaiGokaiger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KaizokuSentaiGokaiger">Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger</a></em> is well regarded among both Sentai and Ranger fans, while its American counterpart <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMegaforce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMegaforce">Super Megaforce</a></em> is loathed by Ranger fans.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ZyudenSentaiKyoryuger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ZyudenSentaiKyoryuger">Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger</a></em> was not well received because it seemed to push aside its rather larger Ranger cast to focus on the Red Ranger. Meanwhile, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoCharge">Power Rangers Dino Charge</a></em> was very well received by Americans, having had a few years to work out the problems of the series and having had the first exclusive villain in ages. It also worked to shoot its own footage.
<ul><li> Even more so in Korea where Dino Charge's adaptation was so popular that a brand new series was commissioned with new villains and zords just to continue it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SamuraiSentaiShinkenger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SamuraiSentaiShinkenger">Samurai Sentai Shinkenger</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai">Power Rangers Samurai</a></em> are a bizarre case... Americans and Japanese alike love Shinkenger... but the Americans despise Samurai despite (or because of) the very similar plot. The <em>Power Rangers</em> series is typically given a pass because it was rushed to production and getting it over with was part of the problem with Super Megaforce.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EngineSentaiGoOnger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EngineSentaiGoOnger">Engine Sentai Go-onger</a></em> was never really loved in Japan and is seen as mediocre. Its American counterpart, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM">Power Rangers RPM</a></em>, is one of the best-loved series in the franchise. <em>RPM</em> had a lot got a lot of mileage out of pointing out some of <em>Go-Onger</em>'s unusualness, such as the mecha designs, and poking fun at some of the franchise's tropes altogether.
</li><li> Among American fans, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UchuuSentaiKyuranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UchuuSentaiKyuranger">Uchuu Sentai Kyuranger</a></em> is getting a nice following. Much of the love is owed to it being <em>Super Sentai</em>'s first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceOpera">Space Opera</a> plot, which has been the basis for two very successful <em>Power Rangers</em> adaptations. It's helped that this is also the first time that <em>Super Sentai</em> production has worked with <em>Power Rangers</em> production and that, despite the team starting at nine members, each of them seems unique, fleshed out, and fun. Until Hasbro took over the franchise, Bandai was apparently looking to skip <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DobutsuSentaiZyuohger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DobutsuSentaiZyuohger">Dobutsu Sentai Zyuohger</a></em> in favor of adapting <em>Kyuranger</em> for the next season of <em>Power Rangers</em>, since <em>Zyuohger</em> had a mixed reception among US Sentai and Ranger fans; and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">tie-in toyline</a> may be more appealing with a motif of space travel instead of blocky animals.
</li></ul></li><li> Somewhat tying into the general examples of Japanese character popularity above, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em> fans in the West tend to dismiss <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKiva" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKiva">Wataru Kurenai</a> (and, to a lesser extent, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDenO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDenO">Ryotaro Nogami</a>) for being 'weak' and 'unmanly' compared to many of the other protagonists in the franchise. Japanese fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderFaiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderFaiz">Kamen Rider Faiz</a></em> don't seem to mind Masato Kusaka. American fans almost universally despise him for being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevilInPlainSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevilInPlainSight">Devil in Plain Sight</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">While the practice of adapting manga series to live-action medium is nothing new in Japan</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionAdaptation">tv shows based on manga series</a> tends to get this reaction from anime fans in North America. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Misblamed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Misblamed">Even went far as blaming</a> this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">the company</a> that licensed the shows overseas rather than production companies behind them. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticLoser">Hence</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">"Netflix Adaptation" memes</a>).
</li><li> When MTV's American remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Skins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Skins">Skins</a></em> was cancelled and overall declared a critical and ratings flop, the creators invoked this, claiming that <em>Skins</em> was a "global phenomenon" that just wasn't catching on to Americans for whatever reason. But in fact, the original British show <em>does</em> have a strong cult following in the U.S., comparable to its popularity in other non-European countries, as the US remake was criticized for beings too <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">Bowdlerized</a> compared to the original UK version, even with MTV giving it a TV-MA rating.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em> is very much not liked in South Korea. This is based on the view that it portrays Korea as a war-torn, third-world country inhabited by prostitutes, criminals, and primitive morons. Many Koreans seem to see <em>M*A*S*H</em> as a symbol of everything that is wrong with Western portrayals of their country, which is now a first-world democracy and economic powerhouse.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy">Jeopardy!</a></em> is one of the most popular game show franchises in America. The original version ran from 1964 to 1975, and the current version has been on the air continuously since 1984, usually paired with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune">Wheel of Fortune</a></em>. However, unlike <em>Wheel</em> and most other American game shows, foreign versions of <em>Jeopardy!</em> are far fewer in number, and far less successful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">across the board</a>.
<ul><li> Sweden would be an exception to that, where a version of "Jeopardy" was a big hit for several years.
</li></ul></li><li> Everybody thought <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dallas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dallas">Dallas</a></em> couldn't miss in Japan, but it didjust about the only country in the world that could show it at the time where it did.
</li><li> Although the ITV show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UpstairsDownstairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UpstairsDownstairs">Upstairs Downstairs</a></em> was very popular in the United States, two early characters  Sarah the housemaid and Thomas the chauffeur  didn't share in the general plaudits. American viewers, who were at the time generally unaware of the "plucky little Cockney sparrow" trope but very aware of the "blackmail is sociopathic" trope, did not share British audiences' appreciation of the two, to put it mildly. Even today when shown in repeats, some American stations leave out most or all of the Sarah and Thomas episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoveHate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoveHate">Love/Hate</a></em> is tremendously popular in in its native Ireland, with one episode enjoying an unheard of 53% audience share. In Britain when it began airing on Channel 5, it attracted middling at best viewership figures.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow">The Muppet Show</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Swedish Chef is not liked by many Swedes, who find him insulting, or not Swedish. This is because of the Muppet not speaking actual Swedish, but a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsLongAsItSoundsForeign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsLongAsItSoundsForeign">completely unrelated mixed-up language</a> (officially termed "Mock Swedish") in an accent that is not Swedish either. The Swedish Chef is basically a polarizing phenomenon in Sweden. Swedes either feel annoyed by how inaccurate a portrayal he is, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MexicansLoveSpeedyGonzales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MexicansLoveSpeedyGonzales">laugh at him for the exact same reason</a>.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em> is considered one of the most popular children's shows of all time in the U.S. and has spawned many international co-productions (with local material and dubbed American bits), the success of the exports varies. In particular, the United Kingdom never really embraced the show, mainly because of a bizarre 1971 incident where the head of children's programming at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BBC">BBC</a> rejected the show in a very public way, accusing it of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotPolitical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotPolitical">"authoritarianism", "indoctrination" and "middle-class attitudes"</a>. Eventually it aired on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ITV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ITV">ITV</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Channel4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Channel4">Channel 4</a> and gained a modest following, along with the universally kid-friendly <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PlayWithMeSesame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PlayWithMeSesame">Play With Me Sesame</a></em> and direct-to-DVD programs. However, the new <em>Furchester Hotel</em> show on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBeebies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBeebies">CBeebies</a> has been doing very well.
</li><li> The urban American feel that kept it from being successful in the U.K. also made it hard for it to catch on in Canada. While the show was eventually re-worked as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Canadian Sesame Street</a></em> (with locally-produced segments interspersed with American episodes) and <em>Sesame Park</em> (an entirely local co-production), the original series was considered too grungy (particularly Oscar the Grouch, though his presence in later Canadian commercials suggests that perspective has changed). Canada has also historically had its own relatively large and domestically popular children's television presence, spawning such icons as Mr. Dressup and the Friendly Giant.
</li><li> In India, it was given a local version named "Gali Gali Simsim", (Street Street Simsim, a literal translation), which sounds more or less close to Sesame Street, the show was mildly popular among young audiences, only Elmo, Grover and the duo of Bert and Ernie retained their names and some screen time, others were either created from scratch. The show ran for five seasons.
</li><li> However, it was in Japan that the show was particularly panned, as the long-running dub of the original American series was replaced with a local dub that did little to translate the series' Western roots to Japanese audiences.
</li></ul></li><li> The TV miniseries <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnsereMutterUnsereVater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnsereMutterUnsereVater">Unsere Mütter, unsere Väter</a></em>, about five friends in World War II, was such a hit (albeit NOT uncontroversial) in Germany, that it was turned into a theatrical movie, <em>Generation War</em>, and distributed abroad. However, it had difficulties finding an audience outside of Germany, given that it's a movie that portrays Wehrmacht officers in a sympathetic light. It was particularly unpopular in Poland, as the series depicts the Polish resistance as anti-Semitic slobs.
</li><li> This type of reaction was the main problem Venezuelan network RCTV faced when they tried to sell their soap <em>Por Estas Calles</em> to the international market. In the country, the soap was so popular and the characters so loved, it was extended and extended until it finally ended after three years.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note125agj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note125agj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note125agj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> In fact, when the original scriptwriter tried to kill a popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> character and end the soap after the standard six months, the network fired him.</span> But the reason the soap was so popular was because it was basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanAClef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanAClef">Roman à Clef</a> of the current state of the country; when broadcast in other countries, they lacked the key, and since the romance plot was very slow and the overall atmosphere so bleak, the viewers did not care. Every country that broadcast it cancelled it after mere weeks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfAnubis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfAnubis">House of Anubis</a></em> is widely disliked in the Benelux countries. The main reason is that the show it was based on, <em>Het Huis Anubis</em>, had already lots of fans there before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Studio100" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Studio100">Studio 100</a> (which only publishes works in the Benelux due to their limited budget) decided to give the rights to Nickelodeon to make their own version of the show. When Nickelodeon announced to those countries that Nickelodeon was going to air it, many looked forward to the show in the hope that it would be <em>Het Huis Anubis</em> they all knew and loved, but what they ended up getting was a show with a completely different cast of characters, plotlines etc. and many disliked the (in their eyes) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalTranslation">Cultural Translation</a> (or de-Flanderization, as it were) that was done.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em> failed in Germany while being successful in most of the world. Main reasons are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> (the stand-up segments were left out; the dubbing had some weaknesses), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeAversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeAversion">Hype Aversion</a> and the fact that the kind of humor just did not catch on well. In its initial run, it only lasted one season.
</li><li> Many international Trekkies dislike the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> episode "The Omega Glory" because of how intensely it uses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland">Eagleland</a> trope, culminating with Kirk reading the U.S. Constitution aloud. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Not that there aren't a significant number of Americans who share the same view.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV">MTV</a> has been a phenomenon everywhere in the world, with the exception of France, where it is niche at best. This mainly has to do with the RTL group having already launched a music channel in France under the name of M6, which fulfilled the role that MTV already had and that launched on 1 March 1987, while MTV only launched there on 1 August 1987. Add in that US imported cable channels generally have limited access to the French audience (you already need a quite expensive contract to watch Nickelodeon or Disney Channel in that region) while M6 is available even in the cheapest cable contracts and you understand why MTV never had success in that region. Not only that, MCM is more or less seen as a French version of MTV and is actually more popular than MTV France.
<ul><li> Most MTV <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTV">Reality TV</a> series don't do well outside of Anglophone countries, leading to most international MTVs actually airing music videos (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkDecay">a feat now considered impossible on the original American MTV</a>), or even airing acquired scripted programming, and even some like the Italian and Russian feed airing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">Anime</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> There are plenty of Canadian television dramas that have aired in the U.S., but the first one that was actually is considered a hit in America is ironically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OrphanBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OrphanBlack">the least-viewed of them all.</a> This was also averted for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SchittsCreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SchittsCreek">Schitt's Creek</a></em>, which is just as big as it is in the US as it is in Canada.

It doesn't help that their previous live-action kids' show, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RichieRich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RichieRich">Richie Rich</a></em>, got just as bad a reception, if not worse.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Empire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Empire">Empire</a></em> was a massive hit in the United States when it debuted, but flopped in international sales, even in Canada, where most American hits succeed (though being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">Screwed by the Network</a> in Canada may have played a role). There have been a number of claims to why, but most comments say that subject matter (about the cutthroat hip-hop industry) doesn't really appeal to international audiences.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhoneInGameShows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhoneInGameShows">Phone-in Game Shows</a> may be a polarizing concept in many parts of the world, but in Flanders, they are universally considered to be a blatant case of fraud, only meant to extort money from unsuspecting viewers, since an episode of the Flemish investigative journalism series <em>Basta</em> exposed the story to everyone. Hell, the two television networks that aired them refused to do so afterwards because they feared a public backlash.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor">Survivor</a></em> was an absolute phenomenon in the United States in the early 2000s and widely credited for sparking the reality television craze there. Even two decades since its debut, it's still one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a>'s primetime hits and has recently gotten very popular in Australia, whose own version is a favorite with superfans in the US. However, the show never caught on in the UK, despite that country's massive market for reality TV. The two British <em>Survivor</em> seasons both flopped, and there hasn't been any attempt to reintroduce the series to the country ever since. For the most part, Britain sees <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother">Big Brother</a></em> as the originator of the "social chess" reality television series instead, causing <em>Survivor</em> to stand out more for its aesthetic gimmicks than anything else.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/UltraSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/UltraSeries">Ultra Series</a></em> suffers very badly from this almost everywhere outside of Japan. In its homeland, <em>Ultraman</em> is a massive pop culture icon, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise">Cash Cow Franchise</a>, and an influence on many creators. Elsewhere, it's viewed as idiotic and cliché crap, with lots of negative comparisons to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em> films. A lot of this is due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>, especially with monster design, but also because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TsuburayaProductions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TsuburayaProductions">Tsuburaya Productions</a>' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">limited distribution</a> caused by <a class="urllink" href="http://ultra.wikia.com/wiki/Ultra_Series/Licensing_Disputes">a long-running legal dispute<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with the Thai company that started the problem, Chaiyo Productions, over the international rights to the franchise.
<ul><li> Nowhere near as bad as mainstream perception of the franchise, but the <em>Ultra Series</em> isn't as big in the western <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Toku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Toku">Toku</a> fandom as other major franchises like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Godzilla</a></em>, or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em>. It still has lots of fans amongst western Toku lovers, but usually at second-rate, with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gamera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gamera">Gamera</a></em> often getting more attention. But in Japan, the <em>Ultra Series</em> is <em>enormous</em>, even dwarfing the others in sheer popularity at times (particularly <em>Gamera</em>, which though not obscure is not quite as popular in Japan when compared to the rest).
</li></ul></li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNoddyShop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNoddyShop">The Noddy Shop</a></em> was aired in the United Kingdom, not only did the show attract a lot of flak because of it being a re-packed version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/NoddysToylandAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/NoddysToylandAdventures">a beloved British series</a> and having what they considered terrible acting and music.
<ul><li> This also applies to any other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportationExpansion">Importation Expansion</a> show based off a British show, since British fans will often think it's inferior to the show its adapting. Besides <em>The Noddy Shop</em>, the most noteworthy example is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SaltysLighthouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SaltysLighthouse">Salty's Lighthouse</a></em>, to the point where it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine">Thomas the Tank Engine</a></em> fandom to deny that the show exists because of it being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Laconic/Macekre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Laconic/Macekre">Macekre</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tugs">Tugs</a></em> that mixed up clips from episodes that were unrelated to each other, changed character names and even censored some scenes.
</li></ul></li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyAndFriends">Barney &amp; Friends</a></em> was mega popular in North America, in other parts of the world it wasn't as big. It's notable in the United Kingdom and Australia, due to those markets already being crammed with various local preschool shows. In the case of Australia, they already had a similar show, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HeresHumphrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HeresHumphrey">Here's Humphrey</a></em>, that pre-dated Barney by almost 30 years by the time it premiered and had an established viewerbase.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chernobyl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chernobyl">Chernobyl</a></em> received universal acclaim around the world for its depiction of the Chernobyl disaster, its reception in Russia was more mixed. Many nationalists and the pro-Putin state media openly lambasted the series as American propaganda for depicting the Soviet government as corrupt and incompetent  prioritizing its ideology over facts  which contributed to the disaster and bungled the response. On the other hand, many survivors and responders, including retired General Nikolai Tarakanov, have praised the series for its startling accuracy and heroic depiction of the emergency response crew.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SexAndTheCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SexAndTheCity">Sex and the City</a></em> was considered to be very daring and groundbreaking for addressing issues of sex and relationships that other shows hadn't discussed before, especially from a female standpoint. Other viewers in the US watched it because they felt it was <em>hot and saucy</em>. In Europe the show was appreciated more for its comedy and camp value, because the fact that the main cast always have sex without removing their bras or with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModestyBedsheet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModestyBedsheet">sheets covering up their genitals</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie">still comes across as very prudish for a show with the word ''sex'' in the title</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Toku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Toku">Tokusatsu</a> is considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">something of an art</a> and a longtime tradition of both film and television in Japan. In most other parts of the world though (especially in places like Eastern Europe, where exposure was nonexistent until after the Cold War), it's usually ridiculed as "bad", "primitive", "cheap", or "lazy" and often called "<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> type shit that should be abandoned for Hollywood CGI". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> is strongly at play here due to the importance of tradition in Japan and that the priority of Toku is artistic interpretation, not realism; not to mention that Japanese movies and TV shows are usually made on comparatively lower budgets than American ones. Ironically, current Toku series do employ CGI, but only in parts where some moves would be impossible to be replicated by a suit actor.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a> series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EmilyInParis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EmilyInParis">Emily in Paris</a></em>, about an American woman employed by a French marketing firm, was well-received in the US but flopped in France, where critics and viewers felt that it relied too much on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayParee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayParee">French</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneLooksSexierIfFrench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneLooksSexierIfFrench">stereotypes</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyWhitey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyWhitey">Mighty American</a> storyline.

<ul><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball">pinball</a> was a huge hit in the United States, and is still seen as an icon of American arcades today, it has had a cult following at best in Japan, where <em>pachinko</em> is much more popular.
</li><li> Pachinko is as popular in the US as pinball is in Japan. For a lot of people in the US, playing pachinko means about as much as watching it, or rather, watching balls roll towards their destination. This only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">worsened</a> in 2015 when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami">Konami</a>, in the midst of their various scandals, announced a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService">Fanservice</a>-laden pachislot spinoff of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em> and recreated an iconic scene from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a></em> to promote a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> pachinko machine shortly after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain">Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</a></em>'s release (which was laden with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> that, among other things, resulted in <em>Metal Gear</em> series creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima">Hideo Kojima</a> leaving Konami), which seriously soured Western gamers' opinions of pachinko, causing them to condemn any and all pachinko spinoffs of video games going forward.
</li><li> Between 2007 and 2009, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Stern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Stern">Stern</a> attempted to market pinball to China. It ultimately flopped due to a combination of using franchises the Chinese were not familiar with (such as <em>Big Buck Hunter Pro</em> and the NBA) and a lack of familiarity with pinball as a whole, which to the Chinese equates with "not interested".
</li><li> For some reason, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Gottlieb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Gottlieb">Gottlieb</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/BoneBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/BoneBusters">Bone Busters</a></em> was roundly rejected by players in France.

He got over with them as the villainous Hollywood Hogan, but when he returned to Hulk Hogan, the fans still weren't impressed. This was largely because most WCW fans were fans of the old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance">NWA</a> and hated the WWF's campy, story-driven style compared to the NWA's hard action.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note137jcd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note137jcd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note137jcd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which was why wrestling ratings on TBS tanked for the brief time that the WWF was on there.</span> Ironically, the WWF/E tried to bring Hogan back as Hollywood in 2002 but had to revert back to Hulk Hogan because their fans refused to boo him, even after he <em>plowed a truck into an ambulance that had The Rock inside it</em>.

</li><li> Toru Yano of CHAOS is a skilled down on the mat wrestler, but not in any particular way that really helps him stand out from the many others of New Japan. He, in fact, had suspicion that he would be doomed to mediocrity, at least as a singles competitor, and took to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Drowningmysorrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Drowningmysorrows">drowning</a> his sorrows until it more or less was his gimmick and he became an almost always playful, smiling drunk. To long term fans, especially those in Japan, who think NJPW has often been too serious for its own good, Toru Yano was a welcome, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveToHate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveToHate">if not always embraced</a> source of comic relief. To foreign fans looking for more serious pro wrestling, Yano Toru is neither embraced nor welcomed. That said, he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">accepted warmly</a> by the live crowds when he debuted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess">Chess</a> is popular in most of Asia, with the notable exception of Japan, where it has never caught on; the Japanese prefer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shogi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shogi">Shōgi</a>.
</li><li> Due to the differences in format between cards in the OCG (Official Card Game, a term given to cards released in Japan and Korea) and the TCG (Trading Card Game, a term given to cards released everywhere else) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>, it is common to see a deck archetype being successful in the OCG format that never catches on in the TCG format.
<ul><li> The codifier for this has to be the TG Agent archetype. The format is so successful in the OCG format that some of its key cards are banned (and for them, rightfully so). In the TCG almost nobody plays it, to the point where people of the TCG wonder why those cards were banned and found it to be strange and unfair.
</li><li> Dino Rabbit, on the other hand, dominated in the TCG but mostly struggled in the OCG against the more popular Inzektors and Wind-Ups. In its case, this was due to a rules difference: the TCG still used the rules for priority (letting a Summoned monster activate its effect immediately upon being Summoned) at the time. Dino Rabbit relied heavily on this rule to work, which made it far trickier to stop in the TCG than in the OCG.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder11');">    Technology </div><div class="folder" id="folder11" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> EMV chips for payment cards, despite becoming common in Europe and Australia in the 1990s, still have yet to achieve widespread use in the United States, with many major banks taking as late as the 2010s to start offering chip-embedded cards to customers, in spite of magnetic stripe readers being notorious for vulnerabilities that allow card thieves to easily obtain and abuse unsuspecting users' card info. The cost to upgrade and activate chip readers (many businesses will have terminals with chip readers disabled and taped over) are a couple reasons for this; it's become something of a meme for customers and retail workers to get headaches trying to figure out how they should use their card and instruct customers on which part of the terminal to use, respectively. Retailers only started moving toward EMV when the card companies put them on the hook for fraudulent charges unless they upgraded. Needless to say, Europeans are nonplussed whenever they have to make payments in the United States due to having to go back to swiping their cards, especially with all the vulnerabilities of magnetic stripe readers (compared to EMV) that make card fraud so common in the first place.
<ul><li> This began to change in 2015. In October of that year, a change in the law went into effect that required merchants to eat half of the costs of any fraud that resulted from a man-in-the-middle attack that stole the card numbers from their systems (previously the banks had to absorb the costs). Major retailers began requiring customers to use the chip reader if they had chipped cards<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15eun1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15eun1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15eun1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">American Express had been issuing cards with chips since the early 1990s</span>, leading to all sorts of whining about why this was necessary<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16bqhb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note16bqhb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16bqhb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the reason for the change had not been widely explained</span> and that it took longer<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note17ihwd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note17ihwd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note17ihwd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Probably a perception created by the unease of having to let go of the card for a <em>few seconds</em> ... it really doesn't take any longer for the transaction to go through.</span>. By 2018 it seems that people have gotten accustomed to this and the backlash has faded. <br/><br/>Of course, to be fair to Americans, the US had jumped out way in front on credit-card security by the late 1980s, when the existence of a real-time network to verify cards and their credit status made the system much less fraud-prone. Americans thus never saw the credit-card system as much of a fraud risk (provided you took care of your own card and its security code) as Europeans always had.
</li><li> This is starting to repeat with contactless ("PayWave") cards in North America. This is largely due to tinfoil hatters claiming that it would be easy for hackers to clone their card and commit identity fraud without even touching their wallet, and is largely backed by studies by "privacy groups". Compounding to things is the competition from phone-based NFC payment systems, which is faring much better in the west, although the availability of multiple, incompatible standards (Apple Pay vs Samsung Pay vs Android Pay) does complicate things a little.
</li></ul></li><li> Nokia. In most of the world, they have a sterling reputation for selling <em>billions</em> of the most advanced and reliable cell phones ever made. But in North America, they are only remembered for some rather unimpressive, albeit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TonkaTough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TonkaTough">Tonka Tough</a>, low-end devices. Blame carriers, who wanted to <em>remove</em> features from their high-end phones to sell piecemeal (such as disabling wi-fi to make people use their expensive data plans) or develop bespoke phones for the likes of Verizon which are completely different from those used in Eurasian regions (BREW instead of Java ME as well as the CDMA wireless standard), and shunned Nokia when they refused to compromise. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Symbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Symbian">Symbian</a>, a smartphone OS co-maintained by Nokia, wasn't as popular as it was in the rest of the world either.
</li><li> The French automotive industry, while still very prominent in most parts of the world, has been completely nonexistent in the US and Canada since the early '90s. Although the big three French carmakers (Peugeot, Citroën, and Renault) were respectively discontinued at different times and for different specific reasons, the biggest factor for their loss of popularity in North America is that by the late 20th Century, French automakers had earned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">a lackluster quality reputation</a> compared to German and Japanese brands, leaving them in unprofitable competition against a fierce domestic market. Citroën specifically was destroyed because their SM model did not meet design regulations particular to the US. Although some Nissan models sold in the US and Canada contain parts manufactured by Renault, none of the French brands have consolidated any coherent attempt to return to those countries concretely since they first bowed out.
</li><li> Video telephony. In the US, the technology has failed to catch on with consumers (at least, until recently, and even then still not on a huge scale) and is widely only used in businesses- largely due to accusations of <em>invasion of privacy</em>. However, in Japan and South Korea, video-calling is <em>huge</em>. This is largely due to the social protocols and culture of the two countries, who see eye-to-eye contact while talking extremely important.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HighSpeedRail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HighSpeedRail">High Speed Rail</a> in the US. Because cities in the US are so spread out in combination with lower population density in many areas as opposed to Europe and Japan<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18albt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note18albt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18albt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is more or less because a good portion of Americans tend to live in suburbs and rural areas, and city infrastructure is built around long highways, which makes public transportation less convenient.</span>, most people taking trips longer than a reasonable driving distance will fly rather than taking the train. Consequently, most of the intercity rail lines in the country use slower diesel engines. This is one of the reasons intercity rail as a whole fell into this in America in favor of automobile and air travel after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. There is one exception: Amtrak's Northeast Corridor on the East Coast, where there are several major cities relatively close together: New York City, Philadelphia, Washington DC, and Boston, which are served by the Acela. Even then, the Acela is slower than the TGV or Shinkansen and caters to business travelers, as it has no coach class.
</li><li> Mechanical sawmills are as old as the Romans and had a period of rapid development in Western Europe from the 16th century on. In the early 17th century they were introduced to the British colonies in America by German immigrants, yet they remained so conspicuously absent from Britain itself that an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend">Urban Legend</a> arose, claiming that sawmills had been banned by an Act of Parliament at the request of sawyer guilds. Despite several authors denouncing that no such Act existed already in the 18th century, the British continued to rely on Medieval two-man saws to cut timber into the early 19th century, much to the bafflement of modern historians.
</li><li> Sony's MiniDisc format was popular in Japan and to a lesser extent in Europe, but failed to catch on outside of a cult following of audio professionals and audiophiles as a more portable, recordable alternative to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CompactDisc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CompactDisc">Compact Disc</a>. This has been attributed to several reasons: the lack of prerecorded minidiscs compared to CDs, the lack of stereo component recorders/players (most were portable), problems with ATRAC compression, and the high costs of players/recorders and blank media. Despite improvements in playback and smaller devices, the advent of CD burners, anti-skip buffers in portable CD players (a feature pioneered by MiniDisc), and finally the arrival of digital music players like Apple's iPod made the format less attractive to American consumers, though MD players did attract a cult following for their small size and the durability of the media, as the discs were enclosed in plastic cases similar to 3.5" floppy discs. They were largely relegated to professional work as an alternative to DAT for field recording and in recording studios, though even these were also superseded by solid-state recorders and computer recording software.
</li><li> The printing press in the Ottoman Empire. While it is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHistory">myth</a> that it was banned there for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">religious reasons</a>, it really was very slow to catch on and it was used only by non-Muslims for a long time, such as Iberian Jews (who introduced it in 1493), Armenians (who adopted it in 1567), and Greeks (ditto 1627), all of whom published in their own languages rather than in Turkish or Arabic. Muslims were reluctant to adopt the printing press because they held calligraphy as an art and considered printed books crude in comparison to handwritten copies. It wasn't until 1727 when the first Muslim printing house in the Ottoman Empire was created (although there had been imports of Arabic-printed books from the West in earlier centuries), and religious books continued to be copied by hand only until the reign of Mahmud II (1785-1839).
</li><li> The Germans and Austrians <a class="urllink" href="https://www.inverse.com/article/32886-google-map-privacy-variation">do not like Google Street View.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Given both countries' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">history</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheStasi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheStasi">authoritarianism</a>, they consider the right to privacy to be sacrosanct (then-West Germany passed the world's first data protection law in <em>1970</em>), and Google faced an enormous backlash when its Street View cars went out to photograph every street in the country, with people frequently petitioning for their homes to be blurred out in Street View — demands that Google was legally required to oblige, unlike in other countries. Google eventually just gave up in 2011 after only doing the twenty largest cities in Germany, and after having its Street View cars temporarily banned from Austria after it was learned that they were lifting data from unencrypted WiFi networks without authorization. (Street View eventually returned to Austria in 2017, but under very stringent rules; to this day, only a few places in Austria are covered.) <a class="urllink" href="https://i.imgur.com/hDo6ZGU.png">This map<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> illustrates it perfectly, with Germany and Austria conspicuous in their lack of coverage in Google Street View.
</li><li> This trope hits Apple computers really hard in the rest of the world outside US, averting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneOwnsAMac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneOwnsAMac">Everyone Owns A Mac</a> scene there:
<ul><li> Especially in developing countries, for example in Mexico: Not only Macs are more expensive in Mexico compared with even branded PCs (not to mention assembled PCs) the only places in that country you will find someone using Macs are music studios, TV and radio stations and universities and even in Mexican universities, the use of a Mac is <em>severely restricted</em> for specific degrees and work niches (like audio and video editing) and many times you will need permission from higher-ups for using one for something not related with its intended use, and sometimes you will need permission to <em>even</em> touch one. Because Macs are so expensive in Mexico and letting anyone who normally only knows how to use a IBM-compatible PC it's not a good idea. Just to get an idea, a regular, assembled, IBM-compatible PC with features similar to those of a Mac costs between 5,000 and 15,000 pesos in Mexico (Approximately 260 to 800 dollars to 2018, including taxes, since Mexico uses the value-added tax regime). On the other hand, a Mac costs in Mexico, already with taxes included, between 15,000 to (depending on the model, which in this case would be the iMac Pro) <strong>117,000 pesos</strong> (about 800 to 6,240 dollars at 2018). No wonder that many places restrict the use of these computers due to their high price, and the fact that Macs are integrated computers, the only way to fix or replace one is to take it with the manufacturer, at a very steep cost, while for a IBM-compatible PC the price of repairing one is relatively low, for reasons more than obvious.
</li><li> Even in developed countries like Japan, the prices for a Mac are insanely expensive compared to Windows-based computers. While Macs are ubiquitous in Western film and TV production, in Japanese anime and manga studios, as well as other media development in the rest of the world, the staff are happily using Windows PCs there. If you visit an Apple Store in Japan, the staff will be overwhelmingly American, since tourists from the US are their primary demographic.

<ul><li> <strong>France</strong>: For all the jokes about the "Frenchiness" of the company that originated in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh">Quebec</a>, after an initial, critically-roasted visit to Paris in 1990, Cirque didn't bring another show to the country until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Saltimbanco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Saltimbanco">Saltimbanco</a></em> in <strong>2005</strong>. The books <em>20 Years Under the Sun</em> and <em>The Spark</em> point out that circus has been a staple of French entertainment for so long that a) Cirque's style wasn't particularly new to them and b) it just takes a lot to impress critics there with so much competition.
</li><li> <strong>China</strong>: After 30 years, only <em>three</em> tours have even made it to mainland China: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Saltimbanco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Saltimbanco">Saltimbanco</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Quidam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Quidam">Quidam</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MichaelJacksonTheIMMORTALWorldTour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MichaelJacksonTheIMMORTALWorldTour">Michael Jackson The IMMORTAL World Tour</a></em>. (Another show, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Alegria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Alegria">Alegría</a></em>, visited Hong Kong in addition to the first two.) An attempt at a non-touring production there, <em>ZAIA</em>, limped through a four-year run in gambling resort mecca Macau, consistently playing to half-full houses. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a>'s enormous international popularity couldn't keep <em>IMMORTAL World Tour</em> from completely bombing in its Bejing and Shanghai stops (selling, respectively, only 28% and 41% of its available seats according to Wikipedia); that the show used a literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedInChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedInChina">Banned In China</a> image of the Tiananmen Square "Tank Man" in a montage didn't help. The company sold an 80% financial stake of itself to a Chinese firm in 2015, however, partially with the intent of finally gaining traction in the country, which will involve becoming more competitive with native troupes and overcoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>: As a <em>New York Times</em> article discussing the sale explained, Cirque's tendency towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot">Excuse Plots</a> about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEveryman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEveryman">The Everyman</a>'s journey (<em>ZAIA</em> was an example of such) don't play well to Chinese audiences who prefer to enjoy large, precision group numbers (think the 2008 Olympic opening ceremony).

For roughly two centuries, the French dismissed Shakespeare as a hack, and viewed the English embrace of him as one of their greatest writers as proof of England's boorish culture and lack of sophistication (and, to be sure, even by today's standards there is much in Shakespeare's plays that would generally be considered lowbrow). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Voltaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Voltaire">Voltaire</a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://triggs.djvu.org/global-language.com/ENFOLDED/BIBL/____HamFra.htm">for one,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> spoke of "dreadful scenes in this writers monstrous farces, to which the name of tragedy is given," describing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet">Hamlet</a></em> as being about "drinking, singing ballads, and making humorous reflections on skulls". It was only in the 18th century when translations of Shakespeare became successful in France (the first performance of <em>Hamlet</em> was in 1769), and even then, it took longer for his comedies to catch on.
</li><li> Disney Theatricals has several blockbuster Broadway musicals to its credit, and they tend to do well internationally  but across <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePond">The Pond</a> in the U.K., the West End has not been quite so hospitable. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeautyAndTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeautyAndTheBeast">Beauty and the Beast</a></em> ran for over 13 years on Broadway, but only managed a little over 2½ years in London even after winning the 1998 Olivier Award for Best New Musical. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaryPoppins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaryPoppins">Mary Poppins</a></em> <strong>began</strong> its life in the West End as a co-production with super-producer Cameron Mackintosh, yet ran for barely over three years while the subsequent Broadway staging ran for over <em>six</em>, only closing to make way for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin">Aladdin</a></em>.

One highly-promoted American production, according to George Jean Nathan, gave the show the rueful nickname "The Gone Dollars."

The reason why is a pretty simple cultural difference: international standards for women push them to be physically attractive and sexually appealing, while Japanese ones value youthfulness, cuteness, and innocence.
</li><li> Sindy, the UK's equivalent to Barbie, still sells particularly well in her native homeland, but an attempt to bring her to the other side of the Atlantic (with commercials starring Susan "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBradyBunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBradyBunch">Cindy Brady</a>" Olsen) was a dismal flop.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/CabbagePatchKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/CabbagePatchKids">Cabbage Patch Kids</a></em> is simply hated by many Japanese fans, due to the doll's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">grotesque nature</a> compared to the simplified yet cute face of the country's native <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HelloKitty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HelloKitty">Hello Kitty</a></em>.
</li><li> An interview with Forbes mentioned that while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/SHFiguarts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/SHFiguarts">SH Figuarts</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em> products are top-sellers in Japan, they barely register with customers in America (As these are mostly niche to some US fans). In the U.S., the brand's top sellers are things like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em> (mostly because of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> connection), albeit Star Wars is only through importing as its toys and SH Figuarts being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">No Export for You</a> due to Hasbro's monopoly regarding the franchise's merch.
</li><li> With the exception of video games, most major toy franchises in the rest of the world are niche at best in Japan (or outright hated, as is with the Barbie and Cabbage Patch Kids examples above). This is most likely because Japan already has a thriving toy industry full of huge domestic producers like Takara Tomy, Bandai, Banpresto, Good Smile Company (Makers of Figma and Nendoroid figures) and Sanrio, leaving little room for anything from other countries. A western franchise that catches on in Japan, like <em>Star Wars</em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013">Frozen</a></em>, will have stores predominantly selling merchandise made by these Japanese companies rather than imported goods.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a></em> hasn't been able to make a dent in Japan as it has in other countries. Japan has its own supply of home-grown girl's series such as <em>Jewelpets</em> and <em>Hello Kitty</em> that make it hard for international lines to become successful in Japan. Japan has had Japanese-geared G1 toys but they didn't help much, which may explain why <em>Friendship is Magic</em> never caught on in the region as mentioned below.
</li><li> Though <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em>' fanbase spans the world, it isn't as huge in most countries as in the US or Japan, which affects the sales of fan-targeted series like <em>Generations</em>, formerly called <em>Classics</em>. Most European territories <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">refused to sell them</a> during the early 2010s, reasoning that children don't care for complex, expensive toys based on the old cartoon and comic characters they never heard of, and old-school fans are too much of a minority to justify the import. Distributors focused instead on toys based on currently-airing cartoon series or the live action films, as well as simplified, generic sub-lines, "1 step-changers", <em>Kre-O</em> or <em>Construct-Bots</em>. This mentality has slowly been changing, but given their niche appeal, <em>Generations</em> figures can still be hard to find, and large retailer chains keep focusing on the more kid-oriented merch.
</li><li> While Gunpla (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a> Plastic Models) are beloved worldwide, the Western audiences hate one subset of these models - the MS Girl-types introduced starting with the Super Fumina in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildFightersTry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildFightersTry">Gundam Build Fighters Try</a></em> as well as the Petitgguys. While they're big in Japan, Western fans <em>really</em> hate them, as they refer to the MS Girls as a "poor man's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/FrameArmsGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/FrameArmsGirls">Frame Arms Girls</a></em>" and believe that making them and all of their variants just prevents Bandai from making popular non-<em>Build Fighters</em> Gunpla, and thus, making the hobby look bad for outsiders as they don't want the first thing they find when someone says "Gunpla" to be tiny bear toys or 14-15 year old girls <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">minus the older woman</span> in skimpy clothing and barely covering armor (with the exception of the Chinagguy).

Yuka (Satoshi's little sister) is very popular in Japanese polls. For the West, she tends to be either despised or seen with apathy. This is because while in Japan her childliness is perceived as endearing, for westerns it comes off as grating and obnoxious (she's 14, but she acts much more like a toddler or a 9-year-old).

A big part of this is that MTV Networks in many countries insist on their Nickelodeon being on upper-tier packages (which leads to similar unpopularity for MTV), which can be especially a problem in places where terrestrial/Over-the-Air (a.k.a. antenna method) reign supreme, like the Mediterranean countries, though Greece and Spain are launching their free OTA feed, which may mark an attempt to remedy this problem.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Episodes that take place in (and poke fun at) countries other than America don't tend to be popular in the given countries. While aware of this phenomenon, <em>Simpsons</em> writers have stated that they never consider how a new episode will be received by a non-American audience. One episode in particular  the one where Homer becomes a gun nut and breaks every safety rule in the book (plus rules that weren't known to need to exist before this episode happened)  was banned from broadcast in the UK, which normally <em>loves</em> the show, mainly due to being aired around the same time as the Dunblane Massacre (which set into motion the banning of handguns in the UK). It was eventually aired 4 years later. However, the ending was edited to further push the anti-gun stance.
</li><li> In non-Western countries, <em>The Simpsons</em> can only hope to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries">Widget Series</a> at best due to the overwhelming Westernness in its setting, humor, characters, and plots, leaving it incomprehensible to someone who isn't already knowledgeable in Western culture. In Thailand, for instance, <em>The Simpsons</em> is a late-night program, in its native English but with Thai subtitles, its audience consisting mostly of people who are already fans of American television.
</li><li> Bart was undeniably the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter">Breakout Character</a> early in the show's run in the United States, but he was loathed in Japan. This is because Bart's rebellious, loud nature clashes strongly against Japanese culture's emphasis on obedience and quiet politeness, especially due to how most authority figures in the show were powerless to stop him. The Japanese localizers knew their audiences would hate Bart, however, and downplayed him in favor of Lisa, whose studiousness and gentleness made her a more relatable protagonist than Bart (of course, she is tossed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassBall">Jerkass Ball</a> in a passive-aggressive way every now and then, but she's mostly mellow). Being more subtle in your snark helps in Japan. In a weird twist of this, Lisa has become one of the more controversial characters in the American fandom. Some fans actually blame it on the Japanese fandom, occasionally accusing the creators of centering too many episodes on Lisa to increase the show's marketability in Japan.

Not helping matters is that any attempt to air these types of preschool shows in Japan have been met with ratings lower than any domestic animation aired in the country. For example, when <em>Dora</em> aired on TV Tokyo, it was constantly the lowest-rated animated show on Japanese broadcast TV.

Only episodes 1-12 and 49 have aired on TV Tokyo. It has been rerun on the Japanese Cartoon Network, but only the same 13 episodes have ever aired. The fact that Japanese viewers wouldn't get the frequent American pop culture references could be a factor.

</li><li> With the exception of Quebec (where the books the show adapts were created), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Caillou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Caillou">Caillou</a></em> was never really huge in Canada. However, the show is notable for its' very large <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryHatedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryHatedom">Periphery Hatedom</a> in the United States, where most parents hate the show because of the titular character constantly having bad behavior in earlier episodes (this even extrends to those who have outgrown the show, who hate it just as much). It's gone to the point where many parents there will ban anything related to <em>Caillou</em>, even the later episodes that featured the titular character having good behavior.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpaceGoofs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpaceGoofs">Space Goofs</a></em>, despite being very well-regarded in its native France, has never made much of an international impact. What little English-speaking audience it has are more familiar with the Stupid Invaders game over the cartoon.

<ul><li> A Ufology example: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys">The Greys</a> are the most common alleged alien encounters in the USA and pretty much became part of popular culture, but in Europe and Latin America, the most common alien encounters are with the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_aliens">Nordic Aliens<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys">The Greys</a> are instead seen as evil.
</li><li> Possibly due to a combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/SuperlativeDubbing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/SuperlativeDubbing">Superlative Dubbing</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor">Patriotic Fervor</a>, it isn't uncommon for fans in France to dislike the (typically original) English versions of certain animated TV shows/movies and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGames">Video Games</a> if the French dub is well-known and widespread.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note26k40w');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note26k40w" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note26k40w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Live Action Film less so due to the nature of the medium.</span> If an installment in a long-running series usually dubbed in French is released without French audio (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubbingVersusDubbing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubbingVersusDubbing">even if there are French subtitles</a>), expect a backlash from the French fanbase, such as with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SouthParkTheStickOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SouthParkTheStickOfTruth">South Park: The Stick of Truth</a></em>; such reactions are typically stronger than how English-speaking fanbases react to Japanese products suddenly not being dubbed.
</li><li> For the US convenience store chain 7-11, the Slurpee is their iconic product to such a degree that 7-11 has dubbed July 11th "Slurpee" day and gives out the beverage for free. It's not unheard of for stores to run out of cups early into the afternoon rush hour. In Japan, where 7-11 is THE convenience store and is so popular that Japanese investors own the controlling interest of the company, the Slurpee never caught on and stores selling them are few and far between.
</li><li> Ben &amp; Jerry's examples:
<ul><li> A few years back, ice cream makers Ben &amp; Jerry's attempted to sell their Chunky Monkey-flavored ice cream in Japan. It was a flop, though the company was baffled why. They discovered during a blind test that the Japanese actually loved the flavor which confused the company even further. Eventually they discovered the reason the flavor flopped: "Chunky Monkey" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiteTheWaxTadpole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiteTheWaxTadpole">literally translated in Japanese means</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAteWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAteWhat">"Chunks of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Monkey"</a>.
</li><li> Their Black And Tan flavour was immediately reviled in Ireland, as it shared the name with a notorious British militia outfit from during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheIrishRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheIrishRevolution">The Irish Revolution</a>, who were responsible for several atrocities.
</li></ul></li><li> Germany doesn't have any Wal-Marts since 2006, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> in job ethics and some <a class="urllink" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-macaray/why-did-walmart-leave-ger_b_940542.html">very odd... rituals.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> They also failed to compete on price. In addition, the market niche for "big box department store" never was as big in Germany as in the US and it was already mostly filled by the time Walmart arrived (by companies that took over the physical stores when Walmart threw in the towel).
</li><li> As a general rule, it is <em>damn near impossible</em> for any films or TV series in languages other than English to gain any mainstream traction in the United States. Whereas Europe comprises many interconnected countries with multiple major and minor languages spoken, the United States is effectively monolingual from sea to shining sea<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note27u590');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note27u590" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note27u590');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The only major exception is parts of the Southwestern United States, home to large, mostly immigrant Spanish-speaking populations — and even there, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MeltingPot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MeltingPot">Melting Pot</a> is a powerful force, with Latino Americans <a class="urllink" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2017/12/20/hispanic-identity-fades-across-generations-as-immigrant-connections-fall-away/">usually speaking only English<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by the third generation.</span>, leading to a common (and not entirely unfounded) stereotype that Americans will instantly turn off any movie or TV show that has subtitles. As such, non-English-language films and TV series often have to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignRemake">English-language remakes</a> before Americans will watch them. Only <em>one</em> foreign-language film has <a class="urllink" href="https://www.imdb.com/list/ls070106228/">made more than $60 million<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> at the US box office — and that film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CrouchingTigerHiddenDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CrouchingTigerHiddenDragon">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a></em>, was a high-flying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wuxia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wuxia">wuxia</a> action flick where viewers didn't need to speak Chinese to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustHereForGodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustHereForGodzilla">appreciate the main attraction</a>. Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho made <a class="urllink" href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/film-tv/article/47346/1/parasite-director-bong-joon-ho-golden-globes-subtitles-foreign-language-films">note of this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> when collecting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GoldenGlobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GoldenGlobe">Golden Globe</a> for Best Foreign Language Film for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Parasite2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Parasite2019">Parasite 2019</a></em> (which managed to collect a respectable $52 million thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Usefulnotes/AcademyAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Usefulnotes/AcademyAward">Academy Award</a> recognition), referring to subtitles as a "one-inch-tall barrier" and saying that Americans were missing out on a lot of great films because of it. It was even worse in the past, as even English-language TV series from the UK and Canada faced strong headwinds in the US market, though this has lessened in the 21st century with the rise of BBC America and the explosive trans-Atlantic popularity of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackMirror">Black Mirror</a></em>. The phenomenon is less pronounced with pop music, as Spanish-language pop has a huge following in the US (albeit with roots in Spanish-speaking immigrant communities), as does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KoreanPopMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KoreanPopMusic">Korean Pop Music</a> to a lesser extent, but even here, songs not sung in English tend to be novelty hits at best (e.g. the Macarena, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Psy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Psy">"Gangnam Style"</a>), and singers who want a chance at long-term American success usually have to sing in English to do so. The main exception is anime, which has a cult following in the US and whose fans seem to prefer the original Japanese.
</li><li> Pizza in China is a simultaneous case of both this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">Germans Love David Hasselhoff</a>. Pizza Hut became an overnight success and is now a part of the landscape of urban China. Domino's, on the other hand, flopped <em>hard</em> and soon left the region with its proverbial tails beneath its legs. The reason was that pizza, as it exists in Europe and the United States, is generally unpalatable to the Chinese due to them containing cheese, which is rare in Chinese cuisine in addition to lactose intolerance being very common in China; and tomatoes, which while well-known in China (lots of Chinese dishes use tomatoes—tomato and egg is a popular combo—and tomato products like ketchup), are still unfamiliar in combination with cheese. Pizza Hut, in a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">Shown Their Work</a>, downplayed the cheese and tomatoes and offered toppings or substitutes familiar to the Chinese. Domino's, on the other hand, brought over the company's recipes unchanged and were soundly rejected. In other words, at least at the time, pizza was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignQueasine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignQueasine">Foreign Queasine</a> in China and had to be modified to avoid this trope.
</li><li> Taco Bell is one of the most important fast food franchises in the world. Born in the United States and inspired by Mexican cuisine (Tex-Mex for connoisseurs), Taco Bell has had strong popularity in the United States and moderate success in other countries. However, in Mexico, Taco Bell is universally hated. Mexicans saw Taco Bell as a vulgar attempt at cultural appropriation, plus the franchise came at a time when U.S.-Mexico relations were not well regarded, mainly due to the Free Trade Agreement and the anti-immigration speeches of Barack Obama and Donald Trump. The few Mexicans who were able to try a Taco Bell product said at one time that it was anything but a taco. Taco Bell tried twice to enter the Mexican market, without any success.
<ul><li> Taco Bell has also had a hard time in the Latin American market. Although Taco Bell has franchises in several Latin American countries, the success has not been as expected. Taco Bell is also hated in Ecuador. During the time the franchise was in the country, they had moderate success. However, several factors, among them quality and poor service, served to discontinue the franchise in the country in 2013.
</li></ul></li><li> International fast food chain industries such as McDonald's and Burger King failed to reach success in Vietnam compared to other Asian countries with only a very few restaurants opened. This is due to the country having a well established local fast food market that you can buy for very cheap and easily shared to the family that international chains can't compete.
<ul><li> Despite hamburgers being a popular fast food in Israel, American burger chains have all but failed there. They were initially adopted with great enthusiasm, primarily due to a trendy desire for American brands. Nevertheless, around the year 2000 local entrepreneurs realized that they could sell much-higher quality char-grilled hamburgers at almost the same price, causing an explosion of premium burger restaurants all across the country. The significant gap in quality resulted in the American chains rapidly disappearing over the course of only a few years. McDonald's, the only surviving chain, is now considered an unbearably-inferior product by most Israelis. And despite being the country's largest restaurant chain by far, it's considered a last-resort option, and most of its locations are located in rest stops where there isn't much choice food-wise.
</li></ul></li><li> McDonald's has a rather curious case in Latin America. While in virtually every Latin American country, McDonald's has been tremendously successful, becoming the most successful food franchises next to Burger King, the company failed horribly in Bolivia. Due to economic factors, the low purchasing power of Bolivians, and a thriving and important Bolivian cuisine that costs much less (and is much healthier) than a McDonald's burger, the franchise ceased to operate in 2002. This case has been studied in some documentaries and analyzed within the marketing case studies.
</li><li> Southern Californians have soundly rejected Papa Murphy's, a pizza chain that only does take-and-bake, meaning you buy the pizza not in a fully cooked state, and you take it home to bake it until it's done. None of the Papa Murphy's locations in Southern California had ever turned a profit the entire time they were there, and the company withdrew entirely from the region in May 2019 when it was evident that they were tanking so hard, the <em>rest of the company</em> was being brought down in the process. Restaurant market analysts and fans of Papa Murphy's agree that the most likely reason is because Papa Murphy's business model is inherently inconvenient and time-consuming but costs less. This runs counter to Southern Californian culture, which values convenience. This was the region that pioneered modern fast food, after all. The wild success of delivery services like Postmates and GrubHub, and of pizza chains that can serve ready-to-eat pizza very quickly like Little Caesars, Blaze Pizza and MOD Pizza, indicate that Southern Californians tend to prioritize options where they don't have to do as much, even if it costs more (or, in the case of Little Caesars, is of lower quality). The chain is more successful in its home region of the Pacific Northwest, where the slower pace of life, reverence for fresh food, and possibly cooler climate in the Northwest making it more comfortable to have a hot oven running for long periods are likely factors.
</li><li> The local culture in New York City is similarly responsible for why national pizza chains, most of which are headquartered in the Midwest, tend to do less well there. New Yorkers are devoted to their local pizzerias, and admitting to liking pizza from chains is tantamount to admitting to cannibalism. New York Jets quarterback Bryce Petty found this out the hard way, <a class="urllink" href="https://time.com/4015967/new-york-jets-bryce-petty-pizza-controversy/">having to issue an apology for liking Domino's pizza<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Starbucks failed in Australia similar to the reasons that hamburger chains failed in Israel: Australia had its own culture of espresso-based coffeehouses dating back to the wave of Italian immigrants to the country in the 1950s. Australian coffee culture did rub off on Starbucks, as the chain introduced the flat white, an Australian creation, in its U.S. stores.
</li><li> While Subway is an incredibly popular chain of fast-food elsewhere, they are completely non-existent in Indonesia with the few attempts to establish it in the country ended up performing horribly. Much of this can be attributed to the fact that Indonesians are unused to sandwich-based meals and prefer to eat their meals with rice which the fast-food lack. While other fast-food like Mcdonald, Burger King, Wendy's and KFC adapt by adding rice to their menu as well chicken for the former two, Subway unfortunately didn't.
</li><li> The Canadian doughnut and coffee chain Tim Hortons has struggled to expand in the U.S., despite having a similar market in its southern neighbor. The usual reason given is that Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts are too entrenched in the American market, similar to how Starbucks failed to expand in Australia. Its more successful American locations tend to be close to the Canadian border or near concentrations of Canadian expats (e.g. their location in Somerville, N.J., which is close enough to New York that the not insignificant population of Canadians living in New York will drive the hour from NYC and pay all the tolls on I-78 to get their Timmy's fix).
</li><li> Dunkin' Donuts itself is largely this in Japan, as local doughnut chain Mister Donut is far more successful in the region with Dunkin' Donuts only being found at designated US patrol bases scattered across the country. By contrast, Mister Donut is exceptionally rare in the U.S., with only one currently operating out of Godfrey, Illinois. Ironically, Mister Donut was founded by an American and only became a Japanese chain on account of its immense popularity there (and because Dunkin's parent company bought out Mister Donut and, ahem, <em>encouraged</em> American Mister Donut franchisees to convert to Dunkin').
</li><li> Hersheys chocolate has minimal presence in Europe since the continent has its own long tradition of chocolate.
</li><li> Straight-pull bolt action rifles are quite popular among hunters around the world but just haven't taken off in the enormous Canadian and American gun markets. Both the availablility of semi-automatic rifles and cultural affinity for lever action guns have already occupied the niche for rapid fire hunting rifles.
</li><li> Dasani, Coca-Cola's brand of bottled water, has done well in the Americas as a safe source of hydration by taking mains water and filtering out most of the impurities before adding in some electrolytes, but in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UnitedKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UnitedKingdom">United Kingdom</a> the product flopped spectacularly. This is because mains water in Europe is typically safe to drink no matter where you are, people in Britain hold higher value for natural spring water that contain greater quantities of minerals and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritCom">Brit Com</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnlyFoolsAndHorses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnlyFoolsAndHorses">Only Fools and Horses</a></em> had used the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllNaturalSnakeOil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllNaturalSnakeOil">fundamental idea</a> of Dasani ten years before its release. It didn't help that one batch was discovered containing excessive levels of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TamperingWithFoodAndDrink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TamperingWithFoodAndDrink">bromate</a>, with the resulting economic fallout leading to the "Sidcup Spring" closing down.
