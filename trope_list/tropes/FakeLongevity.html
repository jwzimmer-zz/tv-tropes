The claim that a game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplayValue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplayValue">contains 50, 100, or more hours of gameplay</a> is often a sign of this.

</p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedLevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedLevelGrinding">Forced Level-Grinding</a>: Some RPGs force you to level up your characters several times before you can move on to the next area.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrop">Random Drops</a> which may result in a player lingering in an area for a long period of time trying to get the drop.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses">20 Bear Asses</a> quests which consist of little more than farming randomly-dropped gewgaws. Common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG">MMORPGs</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassMonsterSlaughterSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassMonsterSlaughterSidequest">Mass Monster Slaughter Sidequests</a> which consist of hunting for and killing the same type of enemy over and over again.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongFightingAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongFightingAnimation">Overly Long Fighting Animation</a> (just extending each battle by ten seconds can add hours to a game).

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterSelectForcing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterSelectForcing">Character Select Forcing</a>, primarily when it's tied to specific objectives that can only be done with certain characters, <em>especially</em> when the game uses switch points to change characters and they are far from the objectives, or when it's possible to get far into a mission before you need to switch, and the game doesn't make it readily apparent that you need a specific character for it.

</li><li> Has very few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckPointStarvation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckPointStarvation">checkpoints</a>, forcing the player to play through large amounts of game they've already played.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingSecret">Missing Secrets</a>, intentional or otherwise, when the game puts a large focus on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>, so you don't know what's really left to collect.

</li><li> Adding a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SprintMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SprintMeter">Sprint Meter</a> that serves no purpose other than to force you to move across the game world more slowly than you would like to.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaitingPuzzle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaitingPuzzle">Waiting Puzzles</a>, which are situations when the best result can only be obtained by doing nothing for a set period of time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuicksandBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuicksandBox">Quicksand Box</a> wide-open worlds that don't mark objectives, leaving you to aimlessly wander around the (beautifully-rendered) 20+ square miles of game world for five hours until you accidentally stumble face-first into a steaming pile of story-quest or desperately look up a walkthrough in your frustration because dammit, you have to get some sleep before work tomorrow.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyModeMockery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyModeMockery">Rewards that are dependent on difficulty level, and only unlock when playing on a particular difficulty but not the ones above it.</a> While negligible for players who choose to start on the easiest difficulty settings, a player aiming for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a> and chooses to skip Easy mode to play Normal or Hard mode will have to go back to the lower difficulty level(s) to get all of the rewards, even if they've demonstrated that they are far more than good enough for those easier difficulty modes. Achievement systems are particularly guilty of this.
</li><li> Forcing you to beat the game once to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnlockableDifficultyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnlockableDifficultyLevels">unlock</a> a difficulty that's required for rewards.
</li><li> Requiring multiple playthroughs to experience all the content regardless of difficulty, whether by making you choose one challenge/reward or the other or by unlocking certain rewards, challenges or endings only on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> (or "second loop").
</li></ul><p>The common thread in most of these is repetition; the player is given the same challenge or experience several times.
</p><p>Extremely common, especially in early video games where limited data storage and short development cycles with small teams limited the amount of actual content available to the product, forcing the developer into such techniques in order to draw more modern play times out of what what be a scant few hours (if not minutes) otherwise. And then you have genres like RPGs where game length is almost a contest, and we're so used to it that games that avert it can seem ridiculously short, when in fact they have as much content as anything else in the same genre (the 2D <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden">Suikodens</a>, for instance).

Even if you're only going for the Pieces of Heart to complete your life meter, you have to contend with two in each game that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrop">Random Drops</a>, requiring a lot of either running around killing enemies for more chances or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a>. Getting all the rings, however, is the real issue. Not only are there more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrops">Random Drops</a>, including randomly-dropped exclusive prizes for some fairly difficult minigames, but there are also a couple of rings that are exclusive to playing the games in each order, meaning that even if you collect everything possible you still need to play through each game twice to collect everything.
</li><li> The Triforce Hunting segment of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a></em> is notorious for being very time consuming but not particularly fun. Particularly since it costs so much to have Tingle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon">decipher the maps</a> that you have to <em>increase your wallet size</em> to even start this part, as you can only carry 300 Rupees and he demands 398 per chart. The HD remaster reduces the longevity by having only three fragments collected via the maps, as the other five are collected directly in the chests that pointed to their maps in the original. It also bumps your default wallet size to 500, so it can carry what you have to shell out for Tingle (although it's still not very efficient to use it).
</li><li> <em>The Wind Waker</em> also has a very long figurine side-quest. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheMinishCap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheMinishCap">The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap</a></em>, figurines are collected by taking part in a lottery that can be done over and over again through collecting shells that are very easy to find. In <em>The Wind Waker</em>, the player has to take a photograph of the NPC/enemy they want a figure of, take it to the figurine maker, who only makes one per game-day (so you'd better get to love the Song of Passing, which moves time forward twelve game-hours, should you want to complete this sidequest; you'll be playing it over and over and over...) Also, your camera only holds three photos. Also, the figurine maker will reject photos if they're not "good" enough. With some photos (such as Tetra's), you only have a single opportunity to take them, and you can't be certain if they're "good" enough until you show them to the figurine maker. Don't save in the meantime. Though still time consuming, this sidequest is significantly improved in the HD remaster; Carlov now accepts as many pictures in a single game-day as you can give him, the camera can hold up to 12 pictures, and the camera puts a stamp on pictures he'll accept so you know whether they'll work ahead of time.

There's only a handful of waypoints around the temple, so there are levels you will constantly revisit. And no, they don't stay opened, so you have to re-do the puzzles each time (although most, but not all, can be skipped or become much easier with newly acquired items). A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">Downplayed Trope</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks">The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks</a></em>, though, since the Tower of Spirits is frequently revisited but allows you to skip floors.
</li><li> In both <em>Spirit Tracks</em> and <em>Phantom Hourglass</em>, collecting train and boat parts can take an absurd amount of time, as in <em>Spirit Tracks</em> you need to collect a large amount of rare treasure — simply getting the Golden Train can take a while, depending on luck.
</li><li> For <em>The Wind Waker</em>, <em>Phantom Hourglass</em>, and <em>Spirit Tracks</em>, the sheer amount of time spent on sailing/riding the tracks may have taken up most of the gameplay hours.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</a></em> is sometimes criticized for this as well, largely due to the vast distances between locations in the Sky and the final Spirit Realm challenge near the end. It doesn't help that the game employs a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SprintMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SprintMeter">Sprint Meter</a> that serves <em>no</em> purpose at all other than making you move from point A to point B more slowly than you'd like, as areas that require you to sprint will be peppered with Stamina Fruit that guarantee it won't run out. There's also a point where you must go through the first dungeon again with new enemies to get Sacred Water to heal the Water Dragon. You can't even skip it by getting the water during your first visit; it will inexplicably be regular water if you try to scoop it up before you're tasked with getting it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em> downplays the tradition of "go to dungeon, beat boss, get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartContainer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartContainer">Heart Container</a>" by having only four dungeons that give said Heart Containers. To find the rest, you have to seek out Shrines and solve the puzzles within to get a Spirit Orb and collect four of those to exchange them for a Heart Container or Stamina Wheel. Since most enemies can hit like trucks, cautious players will do their best to get more Heart Containers, but that requires the player to stop doing side quests and the main story in order to find a shrine. While the shrines themselves don't take very long to complete (unless you get stumped on a puzzle), the act of finding a shrine or getting access to one can take quite a while and it adds up when you have to do it multiple times. <em>Breath of the Wild</em> also has an armor system where you can upgrade your gear if you have the right materials. Most materials are either found in the wild (plants, bugs, etc) or are from monsters directly. Some of said monsters may only appear in specific areas and/or specific times of the day, thus you'll have to do a lot of traveling or waiting around. Due to RNG, a specific material you need may not even drop.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors">Hyrule Warriors</a></em>: Though the Adventure Mode is largely optional if you only care about the story, completing it tends to take disproportionately long: this is mainly due to the fact that most stages take five to ten minutes to beat at their shortest, there're 128 of them, and any of them with Skulltulas in them need to be beaten at least twice to collect both of them. Combine this with the fact that you often need to beat an additional stage or two in order to gather the items to make the enemies visible and/or reveal the stage reward (in the original and Legends versions, anyway; Definitive Edition lets you just buy most of them once you've collected at least one of each), and you'll need to beat most stages two or three times on average even if you manage to somehow A-rank them on the first playthrough.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControlII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControlII">Star Control II</a></em>, hours and hours of flying through hyperspace so you can try to mine a few more metals? Seriously, some hyperspace "jumps" took upwards of ten minutes of just watching your ship fly in a straight line. Of course, once you get the Portal Spawner you can skip around 90% of that (and save a fortune in fuel). Experienced players are sure to do so early on, and it streamlines the entire game. But like many of the sidequests in that game, you will only find out the thing even exists if you investigate cryptic hints and gossip from the dialog trees.

<ul><li> Games based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a></em>'s Riddler Challenges are this. They're not at all necessary, except for the introductory riddle, but give nice juicy chunks of experience to buy upgrades with, and that extra health tank would be useful against those damn stun baton guys that keep popping up. Plus they unlock interview tapes of the villains and character profiles. Many of these require you to backtrack with new gear to older areas just to be able to get them, or require some pixel hunting armed with some fairly obscure Bat-trivia.
</li><li> The sequel game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity">Batman: Arkham City</a></em>, is just as bad, if not worse than the original. 400 different collectibles to be gathered with Batman alone, including physical Riddler Trophies to find, riddles/puzzles to solve, and combat challenges to complete. Without having all 400, you can't complete one of the bigger sidequests in the game. Some of these are genuinely engaging and fun to hunt down or do, but it can be argued that there's a great deal of tedious filler involved as well.
</li><li> There are also the balloons and security cameras that can be destroyed. This is somewhat mitigated by the fact that you can get Riddler information on your map by interrogating specially marked green-hued thugs for Riddle information, and TYGAR security terminals give map information on where the cameras are.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamKnight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a></em> has only 312 collectibles, but it makes things worse by forcing you to get all them <em>if you want to see the game's full ending</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> You had to collect a certain number of "hero points" in between chapters of the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderMan2">Spider Man: the Movie</a></em> game. This translates to a <em>lot</em> of purse- and balloon-retrieval. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em>, as Venom, there's a kid holding a balloon in his tutorial; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">you're supposed to absorb the kid's life</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TronEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TronEvolution">TRON: Evolution</a></em>: Most of the game is <em>excruciatingly</em> long sections of running around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopyAndPasteEnvironments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopyAndPasteEnvironments">Copy-and-Paste Environments</a>, using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeParkour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeParkour">Le Parkour</a> to run up and across walls over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits">Bottomless Pits</a>, and fighting an unnecessary number of enemies when you actually get somewhere. The controls are kind of finicky, meaning you'll fall (and die) several times most likely. Boss fights are usually some form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>, and that's if you're NOT looking for the extremely out-of-the-way collectables (mainly, the Abraxas Shards) in an otherwise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Railroading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Railroading">linear game</a>.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes">No More Heroes</a></em> suffered from this: In order to enter into ranking fights with opposing assassins, you have to first perform side jobs and miscellaneous assassination requests to work up the cash needed to enter the fights. It didn't help that most of these side quests were quite tedious. Thankfully, this was improved in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes2DesperateStruggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes2DesperateStruggle">No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle</a></em>, where you didn't need to pay to partake in ranking fights.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestVI">King's Quest VI</a></em> has a very mild form of this. At the beginning of the game, you can spend a coin at the Pawn Shoppe on one of four items, and you can always trade in the item you've chosen for one of the other three items. Naturally, throughout the game you'll have to use all four of them, necessitating some walking back and forth to the Pawn Shoppe.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Great Maze in <em>Brawl</em>. By this point, you fought a good portion of the Smash Bros. crew and all of the bosses. Done? Nope! Now you have to travel in a maze that consists of all the areas you went through and have to beat ALL Smash Bros. characters AND the bosses (again!) before you're even allowed to fight the final boss. That one level comprises about <em>31%</em> of the completion total.
</li><li> Also in <em>Brawl</em>, the challenges for beating certain modes with every single character in the game. To 100% the whole thing, you need to beat Classic Mode, All-Star Mode, Boss Battles, Home Run Contest, all five Target Smash levels and 100-Man Brawl with all 35 characters. The Target Smash levels in particular are worth mentioning since previous games had one level for each character, but this one has all characters doing all of the exact same 5 levels.
</li><li> In <em>Super Smash Bros. for 3DS</em>, you have to beat several modes with every single character to beat all the challenges like above. This means beating Classic Mode, All-Star Mode, 10-Man Smash, 100-Man Smash, participating in Target Blast, and placing first in Smash Run with all <em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">48</a></strong></em> characters. Fortunately, the Mii Fighters and DLC characters don't count, but that's still a tall order.
</li><li> The <em>Wii U</em> Challenges are more difficult and still include a few "all characters" objectives (including clone characters), such as clearing Classic on 7.0, and All-Star (no continues) on Hard.
</li><li> In both the Wii U and 3DS versions of the game, unlocking all of the custom moves and gear takes <em>forever</em>, since it's comprised mainly of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops">Randomly Drops</a>, and things you've already collected will keep popping up.
</li></ul></li><li> Want the full gamerscore from the 2011 reboot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat9">Mortal Kombat</a></em>? Among other things, you need to have played each character — of which there are 27 without DLC — for 24 hours in total. Two of them can only be unlocked by playing through the campaign, which takes another couple of hours.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters">The King of Fighters XIII</a></em> gives you two options to unlock all the available colors for customization: use each playable character 40 times — and there are over 30 characters — or pay for a unlock key. Other feats, as unlocking the gallery and two additional playable characters, also have requirements as obnoxious as that one, and of course can be unlocked by purchasing a DLC unlock key.
<ul><li> <em>KOF: Maximum Impact 2</em> is another offender. Each character has two costumes with eight color palettes for each of them, but only the first four are unlocked for each costume. Unlocking the other four on each costume (eight in total) requires you to beat any of the 1P modes with every character. While there are plenty of modes to go around (most of them packed inside Challenge Mode), there are also plenty of characters to do this with: you start with 24 and unlock 14 more along the way, for a total of 38. And the requirements are the same for the secret characters too. You only unlock one color at a time, and only for the costume you choose each time, and by the way, grinding them in Mission Mode is useless: you won't unlock anything by completing a mission you already completed with another character.
</li></ul></li><li> Getting everything in the story mode of the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy">Dissidia: Final Fantasy</a> ultimately grinds down to having to do every scenario (of which there are nineteen of them) about three times each for a majority of them. You have to clear it in the first place to unlock the bonuses, interact with every single thing on each map (fight the battle pieces and take the potions, chests, and ethers), and collect all the prizes on the reel in order to reach 100%. Especially for a player who has already played the game, it turns into a whole lot of busywork, and at times basically mandates overleveling in order to be able to wreck everything the way the game expects you to.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonballXenoverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonballXenoverse">Dragon Ball Xenoverse</a></em> 's MMO based structure brings an unfortunate level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">Random Number God</a> into the Parallel Quest design. Sometimes you can't trigger an Ultimate Finish even if you fulfill all the requirements for it. Even when you do, it's not a guarantee you'll get that Ultimate Skill or Super Attack you were farming for. Even worse for clothes and Z-Souls, which may also come with certain conditions before you get lucky enough to acquire them. This makes getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a> much longer than it needs to be.

</li><li> All games in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeTrilogy">Metroid Prime Trilogy</a></em> series feature a search for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon">Plot Coupons</a> that open the way for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">The Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a>, which are accused of only existing to make the game longer. Only the third game made an attempt to shorten the task by putting the coupons along your path as you travel the game normally and not requiring every single one to pass to the final area.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2">Halo 2</a></em> implemented a new mechanic for its "Legendary" difficulty setting. While the foes in Legendary are nowhere near invincible (they're just a bit more challenging), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bungie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bungie">Bungie</a> decided to give co-op mode a 'status link' between the two players; basically, if one of you dies, the game resets you back to your last continue point. In the past the remaining player could retreat and allow his comrade to respawn back in (if they could make it a fair distance from local enemies without being killed themselves), but this is no longer a viable option. Naturally, this means that any blunders can cause you to replay the same room over and over and over again, made much worse by the new health system.
</li><li> After considerable backlash from fans, Bungie restored the old mechanic for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3">Halo 3</a></em>'s Legendary difficulty setting. It (and subsequent games) also have fake longevity via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">Fake Difficulty</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry2">Far Cry 2</a></em> , nearly every single mission in the game is set faaaaar from where you actually receive the missions from, amounting to seemingly endless driving (occasionally spiced with gunfights every time you cross through a guard post) in the process. And while there is Instant Travel possible in the form of Bus Stops, these are so few of those in between they don't do much to cut out the filler.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands">Borderlands</a></em>:
<ul><li> The DLC <em>Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot</em>. Rather than actually create a challenging new clump of story, the designers scratched together three small arenas using leftover textures and models from the game, and make you fight out five rounds in each of them, each round consisting of five waves of about 20 enemies each. So that's 75 waves of enemies to pass a quest that gives you relatively little experience, a paltry amount of new guns, and 10 gamer points.
</li><li> If you want the other 115 gamer points you paid for, you have to sit through over THREE HUNDRED waves in the advanced challenges - which still take place in the same three arenas. Even worse, it holds you back with multiple examples of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">Fake Difficulty</a></em>, like taking you back to the start of the PREVIOUS wave if you die, and throwing in random modifiers that inevitably leave you with no shields and your health draining away facing an enemy which can only be injured with headshots. Oh, and the waves start 'doubling up' later on, so once you've cleared five of the enemies, another five spawn in. Towards rounds 15-20 it seems like there are about two to three times the amount of enemies per wave compared to the starting waves.
</li><li> It's been estimated that overall, the DLC pack takes 12-15 hours to complete (assuming you cheat, in which case it's boring - if you don't cheat it's almost impossible), for 3 maps that each take about fifteen seconds to do a complete lap of. The longevity on this is about as inflated as it can get without bursting.
</li><li> <em>The Secret Armory of General Knoxx</em> doesn't fare much better. You spend hours (literally) driving down highways, occasionally leaving the car to infiltrate copy-pasted Crimson Lance toll outposts to deactivate their roadblocks... with the pull of a single lever (<em>Good thing they'll never think about flipping the switch again!</em>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> ensues as you are requested to "remove" two of these roadblocks. If you have to leave your vehicle and take a walking detour between said roadblocks because the road is blocked entirely by debris, how are the rebel trucks supposed to pass through anyway?
</li><li> The <em>real</em> Fake Longevity in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands">Borderlands</a></em> is the amount of time you will spend walking between locations because your car is made of paper and got blown up <em>again</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock2">BioShock 2</a></em> infamously extended the time it took players to harvest ADAM by asking them to perform a prolonged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission">Escort Mission</a> for every single little sister they find in the game. Rescuing/harvesting little sisters (whether you perform to escort mission or not) is literally the only way to upgrade the player's character. And to make matters worse, you are forced to fight a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBoss">Goddamned Boss</a> after rescuing the last little sister in every level, in addition to the ones <em>guarding</em> every little sister.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder5');">    MMORPGs </div><div class="folder" id="folder5" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> used to do this pretty shamelessly.
<ul><li> If you wiped in a raid dungeon, you often had to walk for ten minutes only to get back in<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0er9y');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0er9y" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0er9y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Originally you were ported to a graveyard outside the instance/dungeon and had to walk all the way back to the instance portal. Have you ever walked to the actual instance entrance of Deadmines in Westfall? Yeah, brand new level 15 Alliance players (most of whom followed someone else in in the first place and so they had no clue which way to go when they were by themselves) had to do that EACH TIME THEY DIED</span>, and then another thirty to get back to the last boss. Unless the normal enemies started respawning, in which case you have to wait for most people to get back in and kill all of them again. And after some real life days, the entire raid would reset. To say nothing about the "attunements", increasingly elaborate quest chains <em>every</em> player needed to complete to even enter the raid, or the pains of having to buff 40 people individually as a paladin with buffs that only lasted 5 minutes. However, in the expansions these timewasters were reduced severely to make raids more accessible.
</li><li> A similar development took place with ingame cutscenes becoming more commonplace even in normal dungeons. Culling of Stratholme contains nearly 8 minutes of talking, most of it at the very beginning, as well as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission">Escort Mission</a> segment with a rather slow NPC. Trial of the Champion had a similar introduction but was soon changed so players could choose to skip through the majority of it, with Stratholme being changed to the same concept in the next patch. Newer instances changed the design completely so that you can generally just do your thing while the NPCs talk, though some bosses still have some pre-combat banter you need to sit through before you can actually engage them. Even more notorious than Stratholme was the final boss in Tempest Keep during the Burning Crusade. This boss was considered incredibly complicated even by World of Warcraft standards, and featured a 15 minute scripted opening that had to be repeated every time you attempted the fight, even if it was your 10th time seeing the same fight that day.
</li><li> Travelling in World Of Warcraft is another form of fake longevity. For the first few levels, you are restricted to base movement speed (most but not all classes get some form of foot-travel aide such as Blink or Ghost Wolf form these days; though they used to come much later). You can buy your first ground mount at Level 20, increasing your speed by 60% of base. You can upgrade it at level 40 to a 100% speed increase. You can buy your first flying mount at Level 60, which is +100% on the ground and +150% in the air. Flying is the quickest and safest form of travel, but Flight Masters often use elaborate, scenic routes. In the past you even had to stop at each Flight Master to pay for the next flight. While some of these problems have been straightened out, even if you're using your own flying mount and the auto-run key it can still take up to an hour to fly the length of a continent, munching scenery all the way. And pray the server doesn't disconnect you for inactivity. It's made more noticable by the way that Zeppellins and Hearthstones are almost instant travel, as are long-distance ships, but you still have to wait for the ship to arrive at the dock (up to ten minutes if you don't want to miss your flight), then wait for it to leave.
</li><li> The guild perk which let someone summon anyone in their raid/group to their location has been replaced with a perk that slightly increases the speed when using the aforementioned flight masters. Another guild perk that was removed does this indirectly by halving the duration of flasks thus doubling the number of cauldrons that need to be made for a raid.
</li><li> There are also the legendary weapon quests, which often require you to repeatedly kill raid bosses in order to collect quest items they drop (and depending on the quest, it might not be a 100% chance). And then once you complete that quest, you might get <em>another</em> one that requires to you farm even more raid bosses. It's not uncommon for a high end raiding guild to spend <em>months</em> getting a legendary weapon.

<ul><li> The game shipped with at least a couple of notorious bits of Fake Longevity. The first is the infamous Tatooine Jawa balloon, which requires at least 30 minutes riding a balloon to get to a couple of stat-increasing items. This 30 minutes does not include the wait time for the balloon to show up at the one location you can board it. The second problem is the orbital station found at many planets. Instead of being able to land directly on the planet, you're forced to stop at the orbital station and run to a shuttle that will actually take you to the surface. This doubles the number of loading screens you have to sit through to reach your destination. Fan outcry has been sufficient enough to get Bioware patch the game so that players can return to their ships directly from the planet surfaces as well as speeder travel on the orbital stations.
</li><li> They also had a special spin on the random loot system with assigned drops in the Normal Mode operation (raid) difficulty. The boss would drop a set amount of loot (2 pieces in 8-man) that on top of being randomly decided, also was pre-assigned to a person who could use it. This was supposedly to prevent loot drama in pick-up groups, but the normal setting was a natural part of the learning and gearing process for organized groups too. This meant guilds could have their tank inquisitor get his third loot token for pants in three consecutive weeks that they had nothing to do with but sell to a vendor, while the healing inquisitor was unable to loot it.

When the game was rebooted for 2.0, the majority of the problems were axed, but the relic quest lines were purposely designed to take as long as possible so that players could get their relics at their own pace without worrying about needing to clear difficult end game content.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostsNGoblins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostsNGoblins">Ghosts 'n Goblins</a></em> is one of the biggest offenders, if not <em>the</em> biggest. The game is insanely hard, with a lot of elements that make the game absurdly frustrating and prolonged, but the worst is this: the first time you beat it, you get a fake ending, and you're sent back to level one on a higher difficulty. You're actually forced to beat the game two times <em>in one sitting</em> to see the real ending, which at that point <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWinnerIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWinnerIsYou">is likely to feel even less rewarding than the fake one</a>. As if that's not enough, pretty much <em>the entire series</em> has this!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Braid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Braid">Braid</a></em> has its stars, the first two stars in particular. The first star requires you to wait at least thirty minutes before you can jump on a cloud, then wait another hour and a half before you can get the star. Yes, that's two full hours of doing nothing but letting the game run. You cannot save or restart the level during this time or you'll have to start over again. The second star must be obtained before you complete the second world or else <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">you must restart your game to get it.</a> Even worse, the stars are so well hidden they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">could double as Easter eggs.</a>
</li><li> The indie/freeware game <em>Billy Bob the Cactus Blob 0.5</em> parodies this with its "crappy invisible maze to extend gameplay".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IWannaBeTheGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IWannaBeTheGuy">I Wanna Be the Guy</a></em>, the Koopa Clown Car boss is actually three fights in a row. The third boss is on par with the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">usual difficulty</a>. However, the first two forms are trivial to beat. Essentially, it's an unskippable two minute cutscene every single time you fight the boss. And given how many times you'll need to do that before you finally manage to defeat the third form, those two minutes add up <em>very</em> quickly. There is a save point beforehand which requires you to get the sphere first THEN jump back into the room with the save point which alleviates this a bit.
</li><li> A good number of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> games are guilty of this trope:
<ul><li> In order to unlock the Last Story in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicHeroes">Sonic Heroes</a></em>, you must complete each Team's individual story, which is standard enough and has been Sonic Team's standby since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure">Sonic Adventure</a></em>. The problem is that each different story consists of four almost-identical playthroughs of the same 14 levels and 7 bosses, with the main differences being different arrangements of enemies and "longer" stages that often amount to extended repetitions. (<em>e.g.</em> in the Egg Fleet stage, Team Rose must merely reach Eggman's first battle ship, while Team Sonic must reach and destroy <em>two</em> battleships, Team Dark <em>three</em> and although Team Chaotix don't have to destroy any battleships, they have to contend with their second and final <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission">Stealth-Based Mission</a>).
</li><li> Playing the Last Story in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowTheHedgehog">Shadow the Hedgehog</a></em> requires you to see all 10 endings of the main story. This means playing through the levels of each possible path <em>again</em> and <em>again</em>, having to play the final levels at least twice and choosing the opposite mission to face the other final boss of that level, and having to play Westopolis <em>10 times</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006">Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)</a></em> contains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading">thirty-second loading screens before and after cutscenes or new areas</a>, the first of which may take less than four seconds; backtracking through almost every level with every team; spacious hub areas; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">Fake Difficulty</a> puzzles (billiards, anyone?) and generally schizophrenic controls which add much onto the twenty hours of gameplay.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed">Sonic Unleashed</a></em> does away with the load screens (to an acceptable degree), and has fair gameplay, but the Fake Longevity comes in with the differences in the versions.
<ul><li> The 360 and PS3 versions take the completely optional collectible medals in <em>06</em> and makes them mandatory to unlock new levels. Collecting 120 Sun Medals to play the final day stage will require either excessive replays, slow sleuthing level runs, or doing a ton of sidequests. Oh, and you'll also need over 100 Moon Medals as well. And Werehog levels may take 20 minutes to beat, each. And don't even mention <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel">Eggmanland</a>. Most of the medals were usually on alternate pathways or required some tricky movements in either type of level. However, given how backtracking is usually impossible, missing an opportunity to get a medal usually means having to replay a level.
</li><li> Meanwhile, in the Wii and PS2 version of the Werehog stages you would get two medals for collecting (almost) all the rings/experience points (nothing too hard for most levels)... and the third medal for completing the level within a time limit, which depending on your playstyle could require at least two playthroughs (though still doable with luck on a first run). The daytime stages, meanwhile, tie medal acquirement to how fast you can complete the level in a time limit alone, meaning a first run would usually net you two of three and then numerous repeats learning the stage and shortcuts to get that coveted S-Rank and final medal. There are also numerous side missions for day and night stages that would provide one Medal of the type upon completion. However, the fake longevity is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted">averted</a> because medals are only used to open the Secret Areas in the Gaia Gates to unlock collectables, extra missions, and increase the maximum live counter Sonic has for stages (he starts out with three and unable to restore them with rings if lost).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicColors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicColors">Sonic Colors</a></em> has mercifully pared back much of the fake longevity. Yes it can take excessive replays to get the Red Rings and the S ranks to unlock the Game Land levels and, subsequently, Super Sonic, but they are completely optional. In fact, you can't use Super Sonic in boss battles. Unlike Unleashed (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations">Generations</a>), Colors didn't allow the player to acquire most of the collectibles on their first run through a stage since Wisps needed to access most of them were unlocked as they progress through the game, forcing players to return to previously beaten stages. This did sometimes allow for different paths to be taken, however.
</li><li> The Chao Garden in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2">Sonic Adventure 2</a></em> (including the Gamecube version). The amount of rings needed to buy things to improve your Chao are staggering. Even if a 0 was lopped off the end of each price, they would still be too expensive. Got an A-Rank on all five missions in <em>every</em> level of the game? You probably still don't have nearly enough rings. As <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/gamecube/533012-sonic-adventure-2-battle/faqs/34152">this FAQ writer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> says, thank goodness for glitches.

The first <em>Sonic Advance</em> requires you to beat the game with all four characters and get all the Chaos Emeralds to unlock the true final boss and get the true ending. In <em>Sonic Advance 2</em>, you not only have to beat the game with four characters like last time, you must also get all the Chaos Emeralds for Sonic only, and you must get 7 Special Rings in one life in each zone to be able to get each Chaos Emerald, and you have to do this with every other character if you want to unlock extra content such as Amy. In <em>Sonic Advance 3</em>. you have to scour each zone for Chao, get a Special Key and complete an act of each zone while carrying it, and then attempt increasingly-difficult Special Stages to get the true ending (though unlike <em>Advance 2</em> the Chao are permanent collectibles and you aren't required to collect them with every character, although there are several that require <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterSelectForcing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterSelectForcing">someone specific</a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicRushSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicRushSeries">Sonic Rush Adventure</a></em> has you do plenty of sailing and replaying levels to be able to accumulate enough materials for upgrading your vehicles, getting the Chaos Emeralds from the Johnny races and for getting where you need to go. The fact that obtaining higher ranks on main levels increasing the number of material obtained does make the grind a little less annoying, however.

This is a marked change from (and an improvement on) the game it's adapted from, <em>Doki Doki Panic</em>, where each character's progress is tracked separately and all four characters have to defeat the final boss for the credits to roll, meaning you have to beat the entire game <em>four times</em>. Since it's a disk-based game, that's not taking into account the frequent disk flipping and loading times going on in-between, dragging things out even longer. Fortunately, Warp Zones are allowed.

In this game, 100% completion requires obtaining a sufficiently high score, and your progress is reset back to 0 if you left the stage - requiring you to rebattle monsters that you defeated.
</li><li> The browser-based <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tetris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tetris">Tetris</a></em> clone <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.blockboxgame.com/Blockbox">Blockbox<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> requires you to complete 15 levels of Classic Mode before you can play any of the <em>Tetris: The Grand Master</em>-like modes. But a player who is good enough to survive for long in the TGM modes will have this licked well within a half hour.
</li><li> The <em>Uru</em> expansion pack <em>The Path of the Shell</em> included a teeth-grating age named Ahnonay, in which a player had to constantly link between the Age's four states of existence (each displaying a greater degree of decay). If that wasn't bad enough, a Relto page hidden in this Age required MUCH more linking than a typical playthrough would. Not to mention, <em>Shell</em> includes, erm, "brilliant" puzzles such as standing in one place for fifteen minutes until a ladder appears. (Thankfully, <em>Myst Online: Uru Live</em> removes a number of the more ridiculous puzzles from "Shell" Ages.)

Castles like Tannenbaum or Carpathia have one-time puzzles in rooms, while others like Baskerville or Romania require the player to visit a room multiple times just to solve its puzzle. Baskerville is particularly bad about this, since to cycle through that castle you often have to <em>re-solve</em> puzzles you already solved once before.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart7">Mario Kart 7</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart8">Mario Kart 8</a></em> pad out the requirements to unlock kart parts to the extreme. Every part requires you collecting coins to unlock them. Some parts only need a few hundred coins while other parts can only be unlocked every few <em>thousand</em> coins. One of the final parts will force you to get 10,000 coins or more. Have fun playing the same tracks over and over again since you can only hold 10 coins max per race. The only consolation is that a few select parts can be unlocked (or at least be unlocked a bit faster) by winning races online and successfully connecting to another player with the StreetPass feature in <em>7</em>, and by playing local multiplayer with three other players as their coins will be added to your total in <em>8</em>. If you lack Wi-Fi and/or don't live in a dense city where you can run into someone who also has their StreetPass turned on, or you don't have friends to play with, then you will have to resort to coin collecting.
</li><li> For most games, if you want <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">all of the gold trophies</a>, you have to 1st-place every cup on every engine class. This means if you go straight into 150 cc mode and get all of the golds for that class, you <em>still</em> need to go down to the easier classes for their trophies. This applies to star rankings as well. <em>Mario Kart 8</em> finally alleviates this by giving you star and trophy credit for the class you earned them on <em>and all classes below them as well</em>, so that 150 cc 3-star gold trophy clear will now count for 50 cc and 100 cc too.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ForzaMotorsport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ForzaMotorsport">Forza Motorsport</a></em> pads out 100% completion with its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes">Driver Titles and Badges</a>, which are snippets of text and avatars displayed next to the user's name in game lobbies. Some are easy, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture">reaching 88 miles per hour in a Delorean</a>, while others are obnoxiously long, such as driving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop">1000 miles in a Toyota Prius</a>.
</li><li> <em>R4: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RidgeRacer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RidgeRacer">Ridge Racer</a> Type 4</em>:
<ul><li> The game advertises itself as having 320 cars to unlock. However, there are only about 16 unique car designs in the entire game (4 tiers of cars * 4 manufacturers), and the number of cars stems from there being four teams with different tuning properties that have access to the same cars and the fact that for the first three tiers, you get one of three variants of a particular tier-manufacturer combo, all of which look exactly the same as each other. Moreover, finishing first in each race grants you only the best car unlocks; to unlock the rest, you have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWellButNotPerfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWellButNotPerfect">Do Well, but Not Perfect</a> and place 2nd or 3rd in some races. And finally, to unlock the final car and final BGM, you need to get all of the other cars first!
</li><li> Opening up Classes 2 through 5 of <em>Rage Racer</em> is quite straightforward: Finish the prior class with 3rd place or higher on every track. Class 6, however, requires going through the Extra GP, which is <em>Classes 1 through 5 all over again except with the tracks in reverse.</em> Oh, and the reward for clearing the standard GP, which consists of maxing out your eg counter, as well as all those nice and shiny cars you spent millions of eg purchasing? None of them carry over to Extra GP; back to the basic Gnade Esperanza for you!
</li></ul></li><li> Two of Criterion's racing games are offenders:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BurnoutParadise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BurnoutParadise">Burnout Paradise</a></em>, there is an event located at every traffic light intersection, and completing a certain amount will upgrade your license. However, the upgrade will also reset the events you completed to get there and allow you to play them again to contribute to the next license upgrade. This is great if you find a few events you're really good at and/or enjoy, but the final two licenses have such a high count to acquire that you'll almost certainly replay many events multiple times over the course of the game (getting the final license requires you to complete <em>every single event</em> once again).
</li><li> The 2012 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeedMostWanted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeedMostWanted">Need for Speed: Most Wanted</a></em> takes this a step further with the <em>cars</em> strewn about the city as well, with events that are associated to the cars themselves. Unfortunately there aren't enough events for a truly diverse pool of events, so completionists will replay the same collection of events up to six times or more on their way to 100%. Despite introducing brand new events, DLC events fall suspect to this as well with the cars they are introduced with.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashTeamRacing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashTeamRacing">Crash Team Racing</a></em> and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashNitroKart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashNitroKart">Crash Nitro Kart</a></em> took this trope and ran with it. Every track has three modes: Normal Race; CTR/NK Tokens, which require you to collect three tokens on the track while racing other opponents; and Relic Races, which place you alone on the track with a timer counting up and boxes that stop the timer for a certain amount of seconds. However, you only need to win the normal races and race all four bosses to race the final boss... But if you beat him, he then tells you that it didn't count and you now have to go and collect ALL of the Time Relics so you can race him again and actually beat the game. And considering the Time Relic Races can be downright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> at times, it'll be a while before you manage to beat the game.
<ul><li> And that's only half of the story! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleUnlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleUnlock">In order to unlock the final racetrack for Relic Races</a> (The Turbo Track in CTR and Hyper Spaceway for CNK) you need to collect all five Gems. How is it that you get the gems, you may ask? Remember those token races? You have to go through what's otherwise a typical race while also collecting obtusely placed letters on the track and then finish in first place. This is oftentimes JUST AS <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> as the Relic Races, as you almost always have to go out of your way to get some letters and then claw your way back up to first in time to finish the race and that's only with FOUR sets of tokens. The fifth, purple set requires you to do a teeth gnashingly frustrating Crystal Challenge where you have to collect 25 crystals sprawled out across one of the four battle tracks and protected by literal mazes of nitro crates and the like. Finally, after collecting ALL of a set of tokens, you unlock it's respective Gem Cup, a series of four races against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">plainly unfair computer opponents.</a> Once you've done all of THAT, you can FINALLY unlock that final track, get that final relic, race the final boss again and win the game for real-real. Thankfully for those playing <em>Nitro Kart</em> (unless it's the GBA version), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">a glitch in the unlock system means</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass">the game only checks if you have the BLUE gem before granting access to the Hyper Spaceway.</a> You'll miss out on the bonus characters unlocked through the gem cups, but when you just want to wrap things up(Especially if you've already beaten the game once with one team and are on your second playthrough with the opposite team to unlock True Velo), that glitch can save you HOURS of replaying races to get those stupid tokens. Those playing CTR have access to cheat codes on the title screen to immediately unlock all of the game's content.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WanganMidnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WanganMidnight">Wangan Midnight</a> Maximum Tune</em> may as well be called <em>Fake Longevity: The Racing Game</em>, and here's why:
<ul><li> In order to have a car that's fully-tuned and thus viable for competitive play, you need to complete Story Mode, which depending on the game consists of 60, 80, or <em>100</em> stages. And each stage uses up one credit. Given that one credit of the game typically costs <em>at least</em> 100 Japanese yen or 1 USD, that's enough money to buy a typical console game! Many unlocks require you to beat all of Story Mode without losing a single stage. In <em>Maximum Tune 2</em> (until the <em>Ver.B</em> patch), this is required to earn the final tuning point for your car. In <em>Maximum Tune 3</em>, you do this to unlock the <em>Wangan Midnight R</em> soundtrack. Did you lose on the final stage? Time to do it all over again!
</li><li> Some other unlocks require you to beat Story Mode multiple times. From <em>Maximum Tune 4</em> onwards, you unlock one soundtrack for in-game use per playthrough, and in <em>4</em> there are three to unlock in this fashion (<em>Maximum Tune 3</em>, <em>Maximum Tune 1</em> and <em>2</em>, and <em>Wangan Midnight R</em>). Even though <em>4</em>, <em>5</em>, <em>5 DX</em>, and <em>5 DX+</em> only have 60 stages per playthrough, that still means you have to play 240 credits at the bare minimum to unlock all the soundtracks. <em>5 DX+</em> revised the soundtracks so that <em>Maximum Tune 4</em>'s soundtrack is now part of the unlocks, pushing the number of stages needed for a full soundtrack collection to 300. And that's before getting into <em>Maximum Tune 6</em>, which has 100 stages per loop. Hope you have a deep wallet and a lot of time!
</li><li> <em>And then</em> there are unlocks that require <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs">multiple no-loss loops of Story Mode</a>, namely the special tachometers. There are four to collect at the least, and of course losing a Story Mode stage at any point means having to play another 60 stages to unlock the remaining ones. <em>Maximum Tune 6</em> slightly alleviates this by only requiring you to win enough stages in a row even if the win streak carries from one loop to the next. Problem is, "enough stages" equals <em>100 stages</em>.
</li><li> All of the unlocks and tuning, by the way, only apply to the car you get them on. If you make a new car, you have to start from scratch to get it to full tune and to get its unlocks. The only relief you get are a "Discarded vehicle card" that you can get from other players to get a 20-stage head start, and, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadExportForYou">in Japan only</a>, a Full-Tune Ticket you can unlock that, when used, immediately gives you a full-tuned car of your choice, and <em>even then</em> that does not unlock anything else.

</li><li> Some RTS games, like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starcraft">Starcraft</a></em>, have missions which require you to defend a base for a set period of time.

This was very frustrating for those experienced with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Beatmania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Beatmania">beatmania</a></em> or <em>O2Jam</em>, which the 5- and 7-key modes, respectively, played very similarly to.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GitarooMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GitarooMan">Gitaroo Man</a></em> has long, unskippable cutscenes at the start of many stages, which you must watch each time you lose and retry.
</li><li> Each <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HatsuneMikuProjectDIVA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HatsuneMikuProjectDIVA">Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA</a></em> consumer game forces you to play songs on Normal difficulty in order to unlock their Hard charts, and Hard charts to unlock their Extreme charts. Difficulty unlocks don't carry over from game to game, so players accustomed to Hard or Extreme difficulties have to slog through the two-buttons-only Normal charts all over again to play the four-button charts. Fortunately, this isn't the case in <em>Project DIVA Arcade</em>, where you're free to jump straight to Extreme off the bat as long as the song is unlocked.
<ul><li> <em>Project DIVA Future Tone</em>, the port of the Arcade version for PS4, takes this back a step. Easy through Hard difficutlies are unlocked at the start, but if you want to play songs on Extreme, you have to complete them on Hard first.

This might not be a problem for those who started with the easiest charts in the game, but it can be aggravating for players who jump straight to Hard due to prior rhythm game experience.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder11');">    Roguelikes </div><div class="folder" id="folder11" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack">NetHack</a></em>, this is Gehennom. A pain beyond comprehension to map-out the standard way due to the presence of maze-like levels on almost every level, demons and even worse monsters than what was fought above, few lit rooms, the worst traps in the whole game everywhere, all of your good strategies start falling apart (pray for nutrition? hah!), and it just keeps going on for a good half of the dungeon. There are many tricks to making it to the bottom quickly but, once you're done with your business down there, you have to <em>climb back up the hard way</em>. On the soft side, Gehennom is behind a rather long series of random generated dungeons with plenty of interesting stuff, so at least it doesn't have to be tackled too often. On the hard side (that is obviously related to this trope), when trying to climb up from the bottom, one should be carrying the amulet that causes random level teleportations downwards - among other nasty things.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder12');">    Role Playing Game </div><div class="folder" id="folder12" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The DS versions of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigimonWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigimonWorld">Digimon World</a></em> games take this to rarely seen levels. The games are extremely straightforward, following a pattern of running throught simple areas, defeating a boss, then go back to the city and talk to certain characters, follow with a short cutscene and unlock a new area to explore. However, the games have a extremely high random encounter rate, and the bosses will prove to be too strong to the player if he doesn't take a good hour grinding on the areas before the boss. The later areas also have a maze-like design with several dead-ends with no reward whatsoever, wich become extremely tedious and time-consuming to navigate due to the random encounters that can't be avoided.
<ul><li> Missions that involve talking with more than one NPC in the areas become very tedious because you must talk to them in order, and NPC B will not appear until you have met NPC A. This is especially frustrating if NPC B is set to appear at a point before NPC A, since the first time you go throught NPC B's spot, it will be empty.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> battles, especially in the later generations, are so <em>flippin' slow</em> it boggles the mind. It's not even that they take that long — once you get further along in the game, most of your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mons">Mons</a> can destroy any basic enemy in one or two hits. And it still takes a frustratingly long time to beat any battle.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightWoosh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightWoosh">Fight Woosh</a> is particularly obnoxious, since it can't be disabled and easily accounts for half of the time you spend in caves or tall grass.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Diamond and Pearl</a></em> were the biggest offenders, to the point that one of the main features of <em>Platinum</em> is that the game <em>is notably faster</em>. The battles were insanely slow, even when disabling the animations, and you couldn't skip anything with the buttons. In fact, if you wanted to use the buttons instead of the stylus, you had to press them <em>twice</em>. If that's not enough for you, remember that Surfing was as slow as regular walking. In a water route with loads of trainers with several Pokémon each, you could easily get your whole team knocked out in desperation. Thank goodness for Repel...
</li><li> And <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Black and White</a></em> FINALLY address this by having HP drain being near instant, so battles are now so fast it's been compared to taking a battle in <em>Diamond</em> and <em>Pearl</em> and putting it on fast forward several times over. And without animations, battles are practically just as fast as you can read and push buttons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonStadium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonStadium">Pokémon Stadium</a></em> eases the pain by having unlockables that can double and quadruple your game speed when you play in the Game Boy Tower.
</li><li> In Generation I, you had to spend a few minutes watching the credits roll through (after beating the Elite Four) before the game was saved. Changed in later games so the game would save before the credits, but every time you would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">level grind</a> a little against the E4, you would still <em>have</em> to listen to their speeches, which is mindnumbingly <em>boring</em> after, well, once.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonFireRedAndLeafGreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonFireRedAndLeafGreen">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</a></em>, in order to get the National Dex to reach islands 4 through 7, rebattle the Elite Four, and trade with Hoenn you need to obtain 60 of the 151 Pokémon found in Kanto. Nowhere in the game is the number 60 implied<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1it8l');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1it8l" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1it8l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">except here, obviously</span> and without trading with another remake, or catching as many as you can as you go, it will still take a good hour or two to get 60 darn species.
<ul><li> Of course, 60 is relatively easy if you've been catching things the entire game. You'd have to be trying, or doing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">challenge run</a>, to not have 60 or close to that by the end.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>DPPt</em> you need to see every Pokémon in the Sinnoh Dex to activate Pal Park, which lets you retrieve your old Pokémon from the GBA games. This task basically amounts to "realize which Trainer battles you skipped and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">spend hours trying to find them</a>.
<ul><li> One of the Pokémon, Drifloon, can only be seen twice in the game: Once in an optional trainer battle that is lost forever by the time you get to the end of the game, and a wild one that only appears on Friday. In other words, if you don't want to cheat, you could end up waiting six days to open up Pal Park.
</li><li> Combee was almost as bad as Drifloon; found on only one optional trainer outside Veilstone City, or you have to take the time to do the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic">Scrappy Mechanic</a> of slathering Honey on Honey Trees in the hopes that Combee appears after waiting up to six for the tree to start shaking.
</li></ul></li><li> There is also Repel so you can avoid most wild battles. However, Repel works based on the level of your Pokémon on top of your party list VS the general level of the wild Pokémon in the area. If you really want to get someplace without any encounters, put your highest level Pokémon in the top slot. The way Repel works does have an advantage that ends up saving time, however — starting with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">Pokémon Gold and Silver</a></em>, some legendary Pokémon would roam the overworld among randomly encountered Pokémon and using a Repel would make it easier to encounter them if they end up in an area with lower-level Pokémon if the top party member was at a level higher than regular random encounters but lower than the roaming Pokémon. Until <em>Diamond and Pearl</em> added the ability to see where they were before running into them (originally they could only be tracked if they're seen once, they run away, and their location is checked in the Pokédex), this made finding them easier.
</li></ul></li><li> To summarize the endgame of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII">Final Fantasy III</a></em> (both DS and NES version):
<ul><li> Last Inn, Long Dungeon, Last Save Point, Long Dungeon, Long Cutscene, Difficult Boss, Long Dungeon with 4 bosses, Difficult Final Boss. Die at the final boss and you've wasted 3-4 hours! (you cannot backtrack to the savepoint any time after the first boss in the sequence). It's even worse when you actually <em>get</em> to the final boss and discover it has <em>one</em> attack: Flare Wave (Particle Beam in the remake), which does 2000+ damage to all your characters <em>every round</em>. If you're level 50 (which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">takes some time</a>), that's more than <em>half</em> your max HP.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em> gives you a lot of access to endgame spells at, well, the end of the game, along with one of them that's not accessible until midway through the final level. Many players are tempted to spend time grinding them out to learn on multiple characters, and due to the low learn rate of these spells, this can add hours and hours of additional playtime. Not to mention making a variety of chains of bets in the coloseum, learning Strago's blue magic spells (most of which are in the final dungeon as well), learning Gau's various rages which are heavily influenced by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">Random Number God</a>, and you can easily spend 40-50 hours to beat the game when it's reasonably doable in less than 30 as the final boss is rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimaxBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimaxBoss">easy</a>.

</li><li> Mark hunting, though (almost) entirely optional, can be prone to this.

Even <em>finding</em> some of the marks can be a hassle (Montblanc's wonderfully vague information on the whereabouts of "Belito" come to mind).

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em> manages to combine this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedLevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedLevelGrinding">Forced Level-Grinding</a> by having achievements for maxing out each individual class. It can take months to achieve level 75 with one class, there are 20 of these achievements. There's also a 30G achievement for completing a relic weapon, which takes <em>years</em> to do, requiring millions upon millions of in-game currency (or real money, if you're that desperate). All of the achievements, when the game was released, required at least one 75 job to achieve (things like gaining maximum rank for all three nations, completing expansion story lines, clearing several endgame areas), and it can easily take a year for a new player to reach the maximum level, let alone clear all the missions. <br/>The problem was slightly alleviated when the <em>Wings of the Goddess</em> expansion brought with it 250 more points, most of which for things that were actually attainable in a reasonable amount of time for the average player (acquiring a subjob or getting a chocobo license - levels 18 and 20, respectively). Even still, it takes insane amounts of dedication if you <em>really</em> want that 1250/1250 score for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em>. Probably the worst part is that <em>every</em> achievement is secret, meaning that nobody who hasn't already done the things you've done will even know that you did them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">removing the entire point of the achievements completely</a>. Game Informer found a guy who had 1250 gamerpoints in the game and interviewed him. He said "It wasn't worth it." <br/>Most of these time sinks were eliminated almost ten years after the game's release with the release of the <em>Abyssea</em> mini expansions which for the first time in the game's history increased the level cap from 75 to 99. A job can now be grinded from level 30 to 99 in as little as 10-12 hours by leeching exp off max level players (if you don't mind being very gimp when you hit 99). Level capped mission fights which used to take tedious amounts of time and effort to get past have had their caps removed making it very easy to solo old storylines. The aforementioned Relics can now be completed in as little as a month if you religiously spend 2 hours every day farming, or just a couple days if you have money to blow. Even travel, which used to be a nightmare, has been trivialized with the introduction of a warp shortcut to almost any zone in the game, several taking you to locations which used to be very difficult to reach. The only real forced time sink left is Mythic weapons which take at least 6 months to complete thanks to requiring repeatedly completing content which requires a key item to enter, you only get 1 key item per day.

All of them feature hordes of boring random battles that are usually very easy to beat, but take a long time to actually fight (and 8 adds slow and unskippable animations into the mix), endless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment">Big-Lipped Alligator Moment</a> style fetch quests, which involve randomly running around trying to find the person you need to talk to (often several), and then figuring out the bizarre and illogical places you need to use Quest items.

And more often than not, they have various energy fields that significantly reduce the amount of damage they take per attack.
<ul><li> Not to mention the often overly long attack animations. This was especially bad in early installments when they couldn't be skipped.
</li><li> The series is kind compared to many games in that each section of text appears all at once rather than slowly scrolling in.

<ul><li> Troops start out in a base class. They can upgrade to one of two classes, one of which is a better version of the base, the other a specialization, such as a Scout going to either a Scout Veteran (more HP/movement/evasion) or a Sniper (weaker stats but get a sniper rifle). These two each have their own further upgrades, for a total of 4 level 3 specializations. To convert to a new class, the character has to have acquired a number of credits from being used in various missions, and each of the 4 types of credits (Arms, Attack, Support, March) has 4 different levels (e.g. Arms, Arms X, Arms II, Arms II X). These are randomly distributed at the end of each battle, and while the top 2 performers get more credits than everyone else, they may not get the ones they need, e.g. a troop only needing one more Arms II X instead getting 3 sets of 2 Arms X. While each conversion only takes at most 3 different types of credit (e.g. 3 Arms, 1 Support II, 1 March II X), plus a Certificate or Diploma (distributed like the other credits, but fairly rare for a good portion of the game), it can take a long time to get the right distribution for a good portion of your squad.
</li><li> Each class usually has several different types of weapons, with many specializations having weapons that only they can use. For example, Scouts, Scout Veterans, and Scout Elites use regular rifles, Heavy Scouts use advanced rifles, Snipers use regular sniper rifles, Sniper Elites use advanced sniper rifles, and Anti-Tank Snipers use anti-tank siper rifles. Each type of weapon has a base model that goes from level 1 to level 10 and costs just money to upgrade. There's usually at least 2 other versions of this weapon that have special benefits, such as a rifle that fires 7 shots compared to the standard 5, or a rifle that has lower attack power but can confer negative status effects on enemies. There's 10 levels of each of these, as well. To build one of the non-standard ones, you need a part that's unique to that weapon type; a regular rifle needs some type of Rifle Part, while advanced rifles need some sort of Rifle+ Part, a sniper rifle needs a Sniper Scope, etc. You get one, and only one, of these from beating a battle, which can take anywhere from a few to 15 minutes depending on which one it is. Each battle drops a specific part. There are usually 4 different grades of parts (A-D), with higher grades being used on the higher levels of weapon. You also need materials, which have 5 different levels with 4 different grades (harder battles drop higher grades) and which are also somewhat randomly dropped; while each map type generally gives a specific type of material, you could need 5 more Steel 4 Type B and wind up getting a whole lot of Steel 4 Types A, B, and D. While it's not necessary to upgrade all the weapons (most of them aren't very useful, and weapons dropped by special enemies tend to be better), even getting the ones you want can take much longer than it should because of all the randomness.
</li><li> There are also some points in the game where you are forced to play the "optional" Free Missions in order to progress the main storyline.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> has many, many locations only be accessible by going through a subway tunnel. In a couple instances, you must go through at least three tunnels to reach the destination. The subway tunnels are cut and pasted from the same handful of sections with very minimal changes between them. They are also filled with always hostile NPCs. They serve no real purpose, but exist to make quests seem longer. Without the tunnel sections, a lot of quests are about 2 minutes long once you actually reach your destination.
<ul><li> The subway tunnels are a necessity due to the game's engine. Having all of the game's overworld as a single unbroken cell would go beyond the limits of the 360's hardware (and probably a good number of users on PC). The subway tunnels allow for Washington DC to be split into multiple map cells with rubble blocking the edges, which are then connected via the subways, which are also separate cells. <em>Oblivion</em> didn't have this luxury, and had obnoxious portions of dynamic loading.

Here, the main overworld itself is divided into cells by insurmountable hills or cliffs and connected by limited pathways to allow for dynamic loading. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate">Beef gates</a> are added to many of these passes to discourage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">sequence breaking</a>.

<ul><li> <em>Morrowind</em> lacks the series' standard map based fast travel, so you need to rely on either fixed-location transportation (boats, silt striders) or one-way teleportation (spells and scrolls). The northeastern side of the map has very few fast travel points so you will end up doing a lot of walking towards your objectives in that area. There are no quest markers so you have to rely on notes and NPC directions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsALyingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsALyingBastard">(which are not always accurate).</a> This makes it easy to get lost finding your objective.
</li><li> Your movement speed is dependent on your athletics skill which slowly increases the more you run in the game. Unfortunately this can make your character move at a snail's pace if they have low athletics which can be worsened if they are wearing heavy armor. This makes moving around the map very tedious at early levels especially if you don't have any teleportation spells or scrolls.

On the one hand, the sandbox world allows an awesome degree of exploration and many side-quests to find. On the other hand, the main quest/plotline is about four hours long if you focus on it and rush through. And to make things even more confusing, partaking in the length-enhancing activities is optional and does not contribute anything to your ability to complete the main quest. In fact, due to a lopsided case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberBandAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberBandAI">Rubber-Band A.I.</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyLevels">Empty Levels</a>, it is easier to finish the game if you do so as early as possible and without distractions than it is after some secondary adventuring. The end result is that there is a lot of longevity present, but it is only "fake" when taken in the context of the main plot. And you need to clear <em>multiple</em> Oblivion Gates to beat the main quest, of which there are only seven maps. On top of it, they are 99% empty of rewards with a lone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops">Randomly Drops</a> sigil stone at the end.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>:
<ul><li> Almost every quest requires you to run a tremendous distance which in turn has a probability to meet randomly spawning dragons, or clear a cave, keep or tomb full of random enemies that mostly aren't even related to this quest's story. There's a chance to kill an enemy with a finishing move forcing you to wait for the animation to end. It also requires you to grind lots and lots of ingredients to level alchemy, which is done by combining those ingredients correctly, thus meeting the criteria for Item Crafting, Grinding and Combinatorial Explosion. Since you've discovered all of Skyrim in a short period of time, running through it again may be considered Back Tracking. Most enemies have a Fake Difficulty, killing the player with two hits unless he's got lots of health potions. While its dungeons are more variable than Oblivion's, they still often look and feel the same, especially if it comes to claw riddles. It's overall promise of 500 hours of game time are only to be achieved by this trope. Thank <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhMyGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhMyGods">Arkay</a> for fast travel. It's most noticable in any quest where a fellow faction member offers to show you to your "quarters", which is usually down a long hallway that they've decided to slowly walk to. Or if a scripted scene has all the essential characters talking and marked "busy". "Waiting" usually doesn't help since these are scripted events.
</li><li> It's especially bad in the <em>Dawnguard</em> expansion, where your faction's base is always situated in one of the corners of the map, requires you to travel to the opposite corner — literally the longest Euclidean distance in the game — at least <em>twice</em>, <em>and</em> requires visiting specific quest locations on the far west, far north, and far east sides of the map as well. With "needs" mods installed it can become extremely tedious to spend several in-game days' worth of travel time just running back and forth. The storyline is actually pretty decent, particularly for anyone who loves the Elder Scrolls lore, although it is probably lost as meaningless on anyone who just wants to have a fun time.

Or the second. No, if you wanted to actually see all of the plot, you were expected to play through the game three full times. This wasn't that the game forced you to pick between seeing two different things to create a sort of branching story, or requiring certain in-game conditions to have been met so that a skilled player could see it all in one go. It would instead just count the number of times you'd played through and would only show you the plot details if you had the required number of completions when you reached the part of the game that would trigger it.

<ul><li> One segment near the last quarter of the game has Mario seek out an NPC that can help him get to the moon. You travel to the location where he was last seen, only to be told by another NPC that you <em>just</em> missed the guy and they tell you where he went. This repeats several more times as you literally have to travel to every single major location you visited throughout the game and this can span over 30 minutes between the walking and the cut scenes showing your vehicle taking off to another region. There is also a side quest involving the same NPC basically has you repeat the goose chase a <em>second time</em>.
</li><li> The scene right before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> lasts over five minutes and can't be skipped.
</li><li> The fourth chapter is very bad about this. When you defeat the chapter's boss, you'll find that you have to go through the Twilight Trail again. And again. You have to go through that trail four times!

The intended way to complete this chapter is to open a safe that contains all the money you need, but on your first playthrough you won't know the code to open it, and the only way to learn the code without cheating (since it's the same code every time on every copy) is by grinding enough money to pay an NPC to tell you what it is. As for the grinding itself, your only initial option is to jump and hit a block repeatedly, and you can pay an NPC to get a code allowing access to a room where you run on a hamster wheel.
</li><li> In Chapter 5-1, you have to punch in a <em>25-input long</em> block-hitting combination to reveal a pipe. To get the combination, you have to go back to the town at the start of the chapter and type "please" <em>five times</em> for an NPC to tell it to you.
</li><li> Chapter 6 of the game has you go 20 fights into a hundred fight challenge, and then run through a featureless blank hallway for about a minute shortly after that.

This is made worse by the fact that the different scenarios you get based on your opponents all require multiple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest">fetch quests</a> and tons of backtracking, and you'll most likely have to repeat at least one of them on every playthrough.
<ul><li> The first <em>Battle Network</em>, likewise, requires you to constantly run back and forth in similar locations, particularly the Waterworks.
</li></ul></li><li> You really have to wonder about the Dracoid Cemetery and Dracoid Ruins in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LandsOfLore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LandsOfLore">Lands of Lore</a> 2</em>. In the cemetery, you'll find glass orbs lying around. You need to charge these at three different machines, which turn them white, blue or yellow, to open the crypts in the cemetery, which will only accept specific colors of orbs. Inside the crypts you'll find new orbs to charge. Two of the machines are underneath the cemetery, another is in the ruins, which is a <em>huge</em> level. When you've opened all the crypts, you'll have to fulfill quests for two dracoid ghosts which once again involve traversing those enormous ruins, which mostly consist of empty space. It's a very drawn-out and tedious sequence in an otherwise fun and immersive game.

<ul><li> Starting with the one the internet is fixated on, there's filling out the bestiary. This can actually be fairly fun at times, if you have the fragment skills that manipulate encounter rate and chances of getting rare encounters, as you'll come across some interesting enemies you might have missed otherwise, and it gives a sense of purpose to the grinding you'd be doing to take on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">bonus bosses</a>. But then there's all the time you'll spend wiping out ludicrously out-levelled enemies waiting for a rare one to spawn. Or having to go through the already annoying final dungeon <em>twice</em>.
</li><li> One fragment requires winning 7777 coins through the slots. This can take hours and is barely interactive.
</li><li> Captain Cryptic requires you to track him down at random location in a large and twisty map repeatedly. Even if you know all the possible locations (and let's face it, anyone that's going for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a> in this game is using a guide) it still takes far too long.
</li><li> A number of important items are hidden in extremely out-of-the-way treasure spheres that can only be reached by a perfectly aimed moogle throw. Beyond just the trial and error required here, Mog takes forever to return after each try. Some of the trickier ones can take minutes to get.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em> series is infamous for its needlessly long and wordy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskippableCutscene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskippableCutscene">Unskippable Cutscenes</a>. Especially annoying for the final boss of the first installment, which had two forms and was preceded by an incredibly long dialogue scene. At least it allows saving anywhere, and with the E-shop rerelease, you don't need to worry about your GBA's batteries running out during your battle anymore...
<ul><li> During a battle, characters lose their turns if their target gets defeated before they can attack. It's played for 'strategy' but in reality, random battles take longer than they have any right to if you just want to mash the attack button (no 'auto' option). Thankfully, the sequels switch to the attack moving to another target.

However, in reality, those are 3,000 <em>missions</em> that take place over the preexisting 24 stages, with some variations in enemies, attacks, stage permutations, and mandatory ship selections. Perhaps to alleviate this, individual cabinets save progress for everyone who plays on the machine, so that players can collaborate together, and the consumer ports allow players to play on "virtual cabinets" with other players. <em>Dariusburst Chronicle Saviours</em> is a lower-ratio example, boasting 200 missions across these preexisting stages.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed">Assassin's Creed</a></em> series is a notorious offender:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreed">Assassin's Creed</a></em> was probably the strongest example, with the flag collection and Templar killing side quests/achievements. 420 small flags spread across the game, which are not always easy to see, let alone reach. They do not appear on any in-game maps, and there's no player-accessible method of keeping track of which ones have been obtained. Even using a guide, if the player has collected any flags and hasn't kept careful track of where they were, the player must revisit <em>every</em> location just to make sure. In addition, 60 Templar Knights are also spread out and hidden around.
</li><li> Starting with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreed2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreed2">Assassin's Creed II</a></em> and in every game since, the large quantities of collectibles (usually treasure chests, though <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedUnity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedUnity">Unity</a></em> also has "artifacts", "cockades", "sync points") are still out there, but they emit a helpful sound when nearby, they appear on in-game maps, and they disappear from the map once collected, making it much easier to keep track of them and avoid having to visit each location more than once. They still qualify, though: The time spent collecting them all will add hours to gameplay time, potentially even <em>doubling</em> it for gamers who only did story missions during their playthrough.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series is infamous for its long cutscenes, at times annoying bosses, and having to eternally lie around until the guards gets in the right position to shoot them. If it was a mere hit and run game it'd be done in two or so hours, just rushing through and killing whatever gets in your way. You can skip cutscenes and even run and gun your way through everything, but, being a series of stealth games, this playstyle isn't rewarded.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em>:
<ul><li> At one point the plot requires you to backtrack to an earlier part of the game and back again, as you need a sniper rifle in order to face Sniper Wolf. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">The Gamecube remake</a> made the backtracking mercifully shorter. Instead of going all the way to the armory for the sniper rifle, just hit floor B1 in the Nuke Storage Building (which you'd be going through anyway). There's a tranquilizer version of the sniper rifle, which is more than good enough to take on Sniper Wolf. There are even hints that it will be there shortly before your fight with Mantis — the ammo for it shows up before the weapon itself does.
</li><li> There's also a section near the end of the game where you're required to input three cards to deactivate a weapon. The only way to get the two cards you don't enter with is to travel, manually, back to previous sections of the game and wait there until the card changes into the required one. Again, a quicker option was included in the GameCube version that involves shooting at steam and coolant pipes to quickly cool down or heat up the card.
</li><li> While it may be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideQuest">optional</a> thing, collecting all the Dog Tags for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">a perfect game</a> on the Gamecube version, much like the sequel, requires you to play through all five difficulties. If you miss one, play it again. Thankfully they're only for bragging rights.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPeaceWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPeaceWalker">Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</a></em>:
<ul><li> Hope you like or at least tolerate doing Vehicle battles, because in order to get everything in the game (such as design specs, your own vehicle units, and even emblems supplying you with bragging rights), you are definitely going to need to do this about fifty times, if not more. In fact, the only <em>real</em> challenge in regards to sneaking missions is the Hold Up and Perfect Stealth Extra Ops missions. And to get Mother Base and its sections to full capacity, you need to do some firing and recruiting either directly or via AP scanning, and the only chance you have at actually getting a random ranked soldier is to do AP scanning, and even then, only via the Recruit option, as most of the soldiers on the map have the exact same stats. You also need high stats just to get the Mother Base to full status.
</li><li> Several weapons designs require an S-rank. Also, several of them also require specific jobs to even be developed. Several of the goodies (namely items such as uniforms and design specs) are randomized in the Outer Ops missions, meaning that you are most likely going to have to do several retries just to get them. Fortunately, if you reset the game when you get it, every time it still rewards you, which proves to be quite beneficial (although still annoying at times) if you want to reset because you lost some of your men.
</li><li> Trying to actually develop new weapons proves to be quite a chore, since they usually take quite a while to develop, especially if the levels match exactly. It gets even more excruciating when trying to develop weapons and equipment that require a tech level/med level/soldier level/intel level/mess hall level of 99, in which the level of progress is between 1% and 2%, maybe 3% if you are really lucky, meaning you have to have at least 33 missions to accomplish, if not 50 or 100 missions. It can also prove to be longer if a member of a unit required for a weapon/equipment's development has to call in sick, and don't even think about firing them while it is still in development.
</li><li> You also have to obtain several emblems for your player name. Most of them also require time in CO-OPs and Versus mode. The single player emblems also are not exempt from the difficulty. With items that indicate doing multiple things, you usually have to do them 50-250 times, maybe over 1000 to get an emblem for undetected stealth, Monster Hunting, and the like, of which you also have to get three emblems each with an increasing rank just to get them, and you have to master in all of the weapons of a category to get emblems relating to mastering a specific weapon, again some necessitating the use of CO-OPs to even level up easily, as otherwise they are difficult to level up (or in the case of the Human Slingshot Band, downright impossible in absolutely every sense of the word). Some of the emblems even require that you do several missions to get, and also these same emblems will also not count missions such as weapons training missions, perfect stealth (in the case of undetected stealth) and others. One emblem even requires you to undo all the hard work you did in building up Mother Base and the development of MSF by firing most of the males, putting the key male characters in storage, and then replacing them with an almost entirely female crew. Some emblems can only be unlocked by getting a certain amount of emblems or codenames. To get Mother Base Master, you need to not only build Mother Base's up completely, even have all of the teams at the 99th level, but you also need to procure or develop absolutely everything. The only good thing is that procuring Uniforms doesn't count under that requirement.
</li><li> Codenames are also just as bad, and usually there is absolutely no way to even know about how to actually get these emblems as they are mostly random, and you can't really even tell how much of a specific type or range of weapon you've actually used under which category of disposing the enemy. You most likely also have to hunt for the same codenames again just to increase their rank.
</li><li> Try getting all the parts for Metal Gear ZEKE, including the Custom's heads. The closest thing to a consistent definition is that you don't damage the parts beyond 90 percent, and even then, actually getting certain parts (most notably the armor, though the boosters, rail gun, radome, PW legs, and especially the AI heads would qualify as well) is completely random. You might never hit any of the parts and yet still not unlock it. The AI chips are also of no exception, as they are completely randomized, and you can't even hope to get them all under a one minute time limit, and a few times you might not even find any new chips in there.
</li><li> In order to get the phone call, you need to accomplish every single mission in Extra Ops, Main Ops, and possibly Outer Ops. Yes, that means you also have to do the dates with Paz and Kazuhira missions, the latter of which is also quite a turn-off for several people due to the...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">implications in that mission</a>.
</li><li> This is all just stuff in the actual game as well. Don't even get started on DLC content, which not only is shown to have a hard time trying to get due to server problems in certain stores, but even when you do somehow unlock the DLC content, the soldiers that come with the items generally have horrible stats, and sometimes if you download the content from the internet, for some reason it just never downloads.

The primary objectives for each main mission are always stated to you by both Miller and your iDroid, but the optional objectives (which are necessary for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>) are shaded out with "????" until you either complete them or finish the mission once, even in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardModeFiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardModeFiller">recycled missions</a>. If you want the coveted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>, you <em>have</em> to play the main missions multiple times, not because the optional objectives are necessarily difficult (some of them are quite easy, in fact) but because the game just didn't bother to explain them to you the first time around.
</li></ul></li><li> Do you like the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em> missions? Do you? Do you also like or at least tolerate Grinding? Well, you certainly won't if you are intending to get certain pieces of the monsters themselves to get the design specs for certain weapons, as they will at the very least be an annoying chore, and at worst will also be nightmarishly long and induce a huge amount of swears. Also, trying to get S-ranks in those missions to gain certain uniforms will also prove to be quite a chore, because not only do you need to tranquilize the main monsters in question, but you also have to do so under a certain time limit, and unlike the Vehicle commanders, there is absolutely no way to tell if the anesthetic rounds are having any effect on the monster or even how much stamina overall you actually took away.

This results in players having to repeat overly long and repetitive scenes, though thankfully there is an option to fast-forward through the dialogue.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder19');">    Wide Open Sandbox </div><div class="folder" id="folder19" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow">Saints Row</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first two games are big offenders. While they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">Wide Open Sandbox</a> games, they also <em>require</em> you to do side-missions or other activities to earn "Respect", which is spent in order to play the main story missions, essentially making the game seem longer than it really is. This was done away with in <em>Saints Row: The Third</em>, as respect is used instead to unlock upgrades for your character and you can do story missions any time you want.
</li><li> Many missions in the first two games require you to go to a specific location to start the mission, only to have the action take place across town. Failing the mission early enough meant you got to repeat the (often completely unremarkable) drive between the arbitrary mission start and the actual action. The third game does away with this by having the NPC giving the quest call you instead of demanding to meet in person.
</li></ul></li><li> Both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EndlessOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EndlessOcean">Endless Ocean</a></em> games are big offenders. The first asks that you find each animal on three separate dives to complete the encyclopedia, and the second <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">requires you to save <em>a million</em> of the ingame currency to re-open the last area</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RedDeadRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RedDeadRedemption">Red Dead Redemption</a></em> has a habit of quests requiring you (for various reasons) to finish quests on the opposite side of the map from where you started them. This usually results in double Fake Longevity as you are forced to follow an NPC from the starting point, across the map to where the mission takes place, and then, once the mission is complete, to run all the way back to the original starting point in order to start the next mission.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crackdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crackdown">Crackdown</a></em> also fits into this with 800 orbs and mini challenges like races to tour the 3 districts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause">Just Cause</a></em> and its sequel are major offenders. The first game had over 40 sectors, each with about 7 bases on average that Rico had to conquer to claim the sector for the resistance and allied gang. THEN there were the loyalty missions and collection sidequests which were essential in ranking up two different faction alliances that gave you better request drops. Each faction mission gave 30 faction points, and the maximum rank required at least 7000. The game itself had less than 30 main missions. The sequel is even worse. Over 300 Bases, hundreds of upgrade collectibles, 300 collectible tokens (underwater supplies, tribal skulls, and drug cases), and at least 50 faction missions and 50 racing challenges. The number of main missions in <em>Just Cause 2</em>? SEVEN.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em>, your party will automatically win and gain EXP and money from enemies that they can realistically defeat just by breathing on them. Such monsters will also run away from the party, and sneaking up on them from behind when they do this makes it <em>even easier</em> to get an auto-win. However, by exploiting this fact and grinding in areas where the enemies run from you, it breaks the game wide open. That's why...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER3">Mother 3</a></em>, monsters you can easily kill will also run away from you, and if you dash into them you'll knock them aside instead of triggering a battle screen.

</li><li> The first 2 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario">Paper Mario</a></em> games have badges that let you defeat enemies who would give you one or zero Star Points (<a class="urllink" href="http://www.mariowiki.com/First_Attack">First Attack<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> lets you defeat them with a first strike, while <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mariowiki.com/Bump_Attack">Bump Attack<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> lets you walk into them to defeat them).

</li><li> Similar to the above example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario">Super Paper Mario</a></em> also subverts this with an area where it appears you will have to fight 100 Sammer Guys in a row to get the Pure Heart. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then Count Bleck interrupts after the 20th Sammer Guy to declare the world's end, and then Mimi shows up around the 25th to stall you with a boss fight. After Count Bleck appears, the remaining Sammer Guys will immediately surrender so you can get to the Pure Heart (with explanations ranging from, "While I maintain that we should fight to preserve our honor, I will respectfully back down and allow you to obtain the Pure Heart." at the beginning to "Just go!!" at the end) and then <strong>THE ENTIRE WORLD IS DESTROYED</strong>.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em> series often uses overly long attack animations that after a while can add a sense of fake longevity. Though the newer games have attack animations so awesome to watch and visually appealing that you no longer mind sitting through them over and over (these can be turned off, skipped mid-attack and fast-forwarded).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou">The World Ends with You</a></em> utilizes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreexistingEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreexistingEncounters">Preexisting Encounters</a> that you activate by using the scan feature and touching Noise symbols to begin battle. As a result, the only battles you need to fight are plotline battles (e.g. making the Gatito brand the #1 brand, which you make so by fighting enemies with the Red Skull Pin equipped). You can also escape battles without fail if they are not plot-critical, albeit at the cost of some Sync rating. However, if you decide to avoid battles, prepare to be bit in the ass when you face later bosses. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">During the third week, you can't escape Taboo Noise battles, and the game employs occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters">Random Encounters</a> when you try to move from one area to another.</span>
