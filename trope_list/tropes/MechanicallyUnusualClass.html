Either it revolves around a specific gimmick no other classes has access to, or it has a strange power set that makes it fit nowhere precisely in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FighterMageThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FighterMageThief">Fighter, Mage, Thief</a> spectrum. This class is often (though not always) named after some sort of entertainment profession, most often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBard">Bard</a>, but Dancer, Mime, Minstrel, Painter and such are also possibilities.
</p><p>What makes the class unique however is the <em>gimmick</em>.

<p></p><h2>Examples:</h2>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">    Action RPGs </div><div class="folder" id="folder0" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The main offensive node for Rogue class ships in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RingRunnerFlightOfTheSages" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RingRunnerFlightOfTheSages">Ring Runner: Flight of the Sages</a></em> is the Gemini Array. Unlike other ship classes, which are armed with the more straightforward weaponry, the Gemini Array depends on placing targeting beacons on enemies and then spending the beacons to create effects such as firing salvos of homing rockets or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HackYourEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HackYourEnemy">shutting down the target's weapons</a>. Rogues are expected to use their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInSpace">Cloak</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hologram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hologram">Subterfuge Systems</a> to give themselves the time needed to set the beacons up.
</li><li> The <em>Lancer</em> class of ship in <em>Distant Star: Revenant Fleet</em> is entirely unarmed (i.e. can literally mount no other equipment at all), but mounts a manually targeted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a>; intended to be used as a sniper. Therefore, it requires immense micromanagement to get it into position so it can pick off a Dreadnought or traitorous space station, and escape intact while its laser recharges.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Eastern RPGs </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The Schemestress class from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulNomadAndTheWorldEaters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulNomadAndTheWorldEaters">Soul Nomad &amp; the World Eaters</a></em>. Instead of dealing damage, healing, or casting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff">buffs and debuffs</a>, the Schemestress has abilities unique to her like dealing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PercentDamageAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PercentDamageAttack">Percent Damage Attack</a>, disabling the enemy from counterattacking, or switching the front and back row of the enemy squad. To a lesser extent, she is also the only class whose melee attack is based on INT rather than ATK. Unfortunately, these abilities fall into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">Useless Useful Spell</a> category most of the time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Bard, Dancer, Songstress, and all their variants in the series. Bards and Songstresses are usually debuffers, but the effects are often random. Dancers can do a variety of powerful effects, but they are also random.
</li><li> The Mimes, present in various games, whose specialty is the "mimic" abilities where they copy the attacks used by others. In addition being able to copy massively powerful spells and abilities for free, mimes in 5 and 6 can use almost any ability possessed by any other class naturally, allowing for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaking">Game Breaking</a> combinations.
</li><li> Blue Mages, like the Mimes, learn their spells by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">copying them</a> from monsters, although as starting classes do pay MP or charge for them. Traditionally, there are also spells that can only be copied from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">certain bosses or monsters that will go extinct</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGambler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGambler">The Gambler</a> job from various Final Fantasy games typically count towards this, with Setzer from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em> being the clearest example: he attacks with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser">cards, dice, darts, slots</a>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromMoney">gold pieces</a></em>.
<ul><li> The Lady Luck Dressphere from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2">Final Fantasy X-2</a></em> in particular has the Reels series of abilities, whose effects are determined by <strong>playing a slots mini-game in the middle of battle!</strong>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid">Relm</a> from the same game would count, using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser">paintbrushes</a> as weapons and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtAttacker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtAttacker">painting magical duplicates of monsters</a> to use their own attacks against them or straight-up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">mind-controlling them</a>... if not for the fact that her high Magic stat has most players ignoring those abilities and developing her as a straight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">mage</a> instead.
<ul><li> All player characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em> have a unique ability, but Edgar, Sabin, Gau, and Cyan fit this trope well for having what are essentially magic attacks (of varying degrees of effectiveness) for <em>zero</em> MP cost.
</li></ul></li><li> Gau, Gogo, and Umaro are the clearest <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em> examples. All lack the usual "Fight" command other characters have; two of them have something else in its place while one doesn't even <em>have</em> any commands.
<ul><li> Gau instead has "Rage" which lets you select a skill based on almost any of the game's monsters (once obtained) and then puts him in a berserk-like status in which he will randomly use either a physical attack or a particular special skill, and the Rage will also copy the elemental weaknessess/resistances and inherent buffs/debuffs of that monster. (Or you could just have Gau use Magic like anyone else).
</li><li> Gogo has "Mimic" by default and the player can choose to equip any three other skills on him.
</li><li> Umaro is a berserker with no in-battle control, but equipping Relics can change his actions, including letting him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FastballSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FastballSpecial">Fastball Special</a> the other party members.
</li></ul></li><li> Calculators/Arithmetician from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em> are very slow and weak, but their ability lets them cast spells from other casting classes for free, with no charge time, under certain (numerical, hence the name) parameters. After purchasing all of these, as well as all of the usable spells, they are very good characters, but this is very time consuming.
</li><li> The Moogle Animist from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</a></em> uses skills that involve summoning diverse animals and causing both damage and status effects in oddly shaped areas of effect.
</li><li> The Nu Mou Morph, also from <em>Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</em>, mimics the abilities of monsters you captured previously.
</li><li> The Gadgeteer from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</a></em>, or Tinker in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2">the sequel</a>, is regarded as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy">the worst class in both games</a> by most players due to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGenerator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGenerator">sheer unreliability</a>. Gadgeteer/Tinker abilities can cast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff">buffs</a>, [[debuffs, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusAilments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusAilments">Standard Status Ailments</a> ailments]] on <em>either</em> every enemy or every ally. So yes, if you're unlucky, you can end up casting Haste on every enemy or inflicting Doom on all allies.
</li><li> Chocobo Knight, from <em>Final Fantasy Tactics A2</em>, definitely counts towards this trope. Unlike all the other standard-type classes in the game, which learn theirs abilities from equipments, the Chocobo Knight's abilities depend on what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MascotMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MascotMook">Chocobo</a> he is mounted on. He can't use any abilities when unmounted (except secondary ones of course, though he can't use them while mounted as a trade-off).
</li><li> The Memorist class from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyDimensions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyDimensions">Final Fantasy Dimensions</a></em>. The stats for this class are a flat 10 in every category no matter what level the character is, but by returning to places where cutscenes occurred, the player can get items that allow them to increase the stats by a few points according to their liking allowing for an immense amount of customization. As well rather than learning and equipping abilities like the other classes the Memorist instead draws on a randomly selected assortment of abilities the character has already learned.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em>: The Insect Glaive is the only weapon in the game with an aerial moveset, allowing the player to parkour all around a monster throughout the fight. The accompanying Kinsect instills a variety of status effects by collecting extract and augmenting the Insect Glaive user's attacks. The IG is considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">Difficult, but Awesome</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> in skilled hands.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> In competitive play, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a> that focus on the move Baton Pass have a tendency to be this, often using Substitute for endurance purposes and then racking up status buffs in hopes of lasting long enough to pass them on to the next <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a>. Pokemon given these movesets are often passed up outside competitive play, as it's faster and easier to just mow through the in-game opponents with high-leveled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a>.
</li><li> Ditto (which cannot do anything other than transform into the opponent, copying their moves) and Smeargle (which can permanently learn any move in the game by copying it, but has horrendous stats) are rarely used for similar reasons. Ditto at least is very useful for breeding however, while Smeargle is very useful because it can learn the only perfectly-accurate Sleep move in the game (Spore), set up buffs while the opponent sleeps, then Baton Pass. Smeargle is also used in some rather convoluted breeding chains; when breeding Pokemon, the offspring's species will be the unevolved form of the mother, with the moveset of the father. However, many Pokemon are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace">One-Gender Race</a>, requiring "creative" workarounds.
</li><li> Shedinja is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a>, the only one in the games. If it takes damage, it faints immediately. But its unique Ability, Wonder Guard, makes it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KungFuProofMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KungFuProofMook">completely immune</a> to any attack that isn't super effective, meaning that if the opponent lacks any Dark, Fire, Flying, Ghost, or Rock moves, Shedinja is effectively invincible. However, Shedinja is not immune to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">Standard Status Effects</a> and other forms of indirect damage, so opponents may be able to take it down without attacking.
</li><li> Wishiwashi blends evolution and Ability-based forms, thanks to its unique Ability Schooling. If Wishiwashi is low-level, it will be stuck in its weak Solo form, featuring the lowest base stat total of any Pokémon. However, once it hits level 20, Schooling transforms it into the mighty School form as long as its health stays above 25%, giving it a base stat total rivaling some legendaries.
</li><li> A Greninja with battle bond can transform into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Ash-Greninja</a> after scoring a KO, effectively giving it its own Mega-Evolution without having to hold a held item.
</li><li> Necrozma has the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ultra Burst, during which it uses its Z-crystal to perform what amounts to a Mega Evolution, after which it immediately performs its Z-move.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em>:
<ul><li> The vast majority of classes depend on what Djinn are attached to the character (giving a Mars Djinni to a Venus character makes him go from Squire to Brute, for example). Most non-standard classes require all but two Djinni to be of the same element, but some like the Ninja, Samurai and Dark Mage require three of each. This tends to verge into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> territory, as Djinn can be summoned in battle as spells, which lowers stats and completely changes available spells.
</li><li> In <em>The Lost Age</em>, there are items that can be equipped to change the character's class. These tend to be drastically different from the base classes made through djinn.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn">Dark Dawn</a></em> has an inversion: Sveta's base class has some useful abilities, but what you <em>really</em> want is her Beastform ability, which allows her to attack every single enemy at once every turn (no one else can do this).
</li></ul></li><li> Mercedes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdinSphere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdinSphere">Odin Sphere</a></em> is the most drastically different of the five characters. While other characters use melee attacks to varying degrees, Mercedes wields a crossbow and is purely a ranged character. Being a fairy allows her to fly around indefinitely, and instead of a POW meter that acts as the character's stamina, depleting as you attack, but recharging if you idle long enough, she instead has an Ammo meter that can't be recharged until it's completely empty, and requires the player to manually reload (though absorbing Phozons still recharges it like they do for the POW meter.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MakaiToshiSaGa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MakaiToshiSaGa">Makai Toshi SaGa</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaGa2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaGa2">its sequel</a> has a rudimentary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JobSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JobSystem">Job System</a> that allows players to assemble a party of four from a selection of different races, all of which defy traditional definitions for classes as seen in other RPGs:
<ul><li> Humans cannot gain stats through leveling, and instead must consume items to increase their stats. They are incapable of using magic, but they can use eight equipment slots to outfit themselves with various weapons and armor.
</li><li> Espers (Mutants in the English releases) increase stats at random points after battles. They can only use four equipment slots, but can learn up to four randomly-learned magic abilities.
</li><li> Monsters can only get stronger by eating meat randomly dropped from defeated enemies and transforming into a different monster. The form they transform into depend on their current form and the monster that dropped the meat.
</li><li> Robots change their stats based on their equipment. The weapons they are equipped with only have half as many uses as when equipped by humans or espers, but they can recharge their weapons' durability by resting in inns.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Western RPG </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The Abomination and Flagellant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkestDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkestDungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a>.</em>
<ul><li> The Abomination is unique because he has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StanceSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StanceSystem">Stance System</a>: all characters have seven moves, but he has all seven unlocked to begin with, instead of the usual four, with different sets available depending on whether he's turned into his werewolf-like beast mode or is in his human form. While he's in beast mode, he gains extremely powerful attacks, but accumulates stress quickly, while his human form is somewhat more fragile, with less power but more utility (he isn't able to hit as many targets from as many positions as the beast mode, but can stun and inflict blight), and he has a weak self-healing skill that's also one of the few in the game that heal stress. He's also dangerous to the party, in that his beast mode causes all other party members to stress out as well, making the Abomination difficult to use effectively, but extremely powerful if used well.
</li><li> The Flagellant, meanwhile, interacts with the stress and health systems in weird ways, making him much harder to get a handle on than other characters. He gets stronger as he loses health, and some of his best skills can't be activated unless he's at low health <em>and also</em> heal him so that they can't be used successively. He can <em>never</em> develop a virtue when his resolve is tested, and he will always develop the same affliction, Rapturous, where he becomes convinced that bloodletting is good for friend and foe alike, and starts smacking around the party as well as the enemies (though he does get a stronger buff when his health is low while Rapturous). He also can only use the flagellation stress relief activity in town. His advantages (utterly <em>massive</em> amounts of bleed damage to enemies, as well as being basically unkillable if his skills are set up right) make him a force to be reckoned with, but he is completely ineffective against undead (who don't bleed), and his disadvantages can pile up and become overwhelming very quickly, especially when he gets afflicted.
</li></ul></li><li> Almost every single character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LISA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LISA">LISA</a></em> has a unique playstyle to some extent, but the most stand-out examples are the following:
<ul><li> Ajeet, whose Standard Attack is replaced with a variety of Poke skills that deal no damage but give guaranteed status effects. His only source of direct damage is through his potent Finger Beams and physical attacks, all of which cost SP.
</li><li> Birdie, a support-based party member whose Standard Attack is *getting himself drunk*. He more than makes up for it for having a heal that affects your entire party along with the ability to dish out Oil, the most powerful status effect in the game.
</li><li> Carp, who can lower enemies' stats with his Slash skills.
</li><li> Queen Roger, whose prime source of damage, his Beatdown skill, will inflict a different status effect depending on the weapon he has equipped.
</li><li> Shocklord has only one attack: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">falling on his face</a> and dealing heavy damage to all enemies.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VampireTheMasqueradeBloodlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VampireTheMasqueradeBloodlines"> Vampire: The Masquerade  Bloodlines</a></em>, the various vampire bloodlines play the part of classes. Most of them are fairly standard; they have varying focus on combat, stealth, social skills, and so on, but all play in largely the same way doing the same quests. The Nosferatu, on the other hand, are so hideously deformed that they can't risk being seen by ordinary humans. Since most of the game involves wandering around cities populated mainly by ordinary humans, this requires a completely different style of play - they have to spend most of their time in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SewerLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SewerLevel">sewers</a>, and will struggle to acquire many quests or even talk to many NPCs.
<ul><li> Arguably the Malkavians also fit. Being completely insane, every piece of dialogue in the game was rewritten for just this class. Although the actual gameplay remains essentially the same, since the game has a strong focus on story and social interactions this can actually be more significant than any other differences between classes.
</li></ul></li><li> Dragons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a> VIII</em> had the gimmick of being, well, dragons — unable to wield weapons or use armour like <em>every</em> other race/class, and sharing the minotaur's inability to wear headgear or boots, but possessing a powerful inherent attack, special abilities and natural armour all improved by a single skill. Perhaps understandably, you couldn't start play as one.
</li></ul></div>
<div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder3');">    First-Person Shooters </div><div class="folder" id="folder3" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> All the classes are like this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em> (new weapon loadouts have only accentuated it for most), a few stand out. Here they are in order of uniqueness from most to least:
<ul><li> The Engineer is mechanically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">(har har)</a> interesting, as while he can deal a bit of damage, his primary purpose is to build gadgets which can teleport teammates across the map and replenish their ammo (as well as heal and deal damage). Other classes fight in a more direct manner. Also, the majority of the damage he deals doesn't even come from him, it comes from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SentryGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SentryGun">Sentry Gun</a>, which aims and fires automatically. Pretty much the only reason the Engineer even has a Shotgun and a Pistol is so he isn't completely dependent upon it.
</li><li> Then there's the Spy, who focuses on mind games; he can turn himself invisible, and can disguise himself as the enemy, and is one of the only classes to focus on facing and is the only class in a normal game who does most of his best damage at melee range.
</li><li> The Medic is focused almost purely on healing and turning himself and one teammate either invulnerable, nearly invulnerable, or a source of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Hits</a>. Also, the Medigun, once it latches onto a teammate, doesn't actually need to be aimed; the healing beam will follow the "patient" around until he dies, the Medic dies, gets too far away, or the Medic shuts off the Medigun.
</li><li> The Pyro, while usually played as a straightforward class, has found himself a unique niche when his flamethrower weapon gained the ability to blast compressed air to deflect projectiles, push away enemies and put out teammates on fire. That and "spy-check": Your teammates are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyFireproof" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyFireproof">Friendly Fireproof</a>. A spy pretending to be a teammate is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOnFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOnFire">not</a>.
</li><li> Later updates have added new loadout options for many classes that certainly qualify, at least compared to their original playstyle:
<ul><li> The "Demoknight", a Demoman ditching his trademark sticky grenade launcher for a shield that allows him to charge at enemies and fight them in melee.
</li><li> Snipers with the Huntsman Bow instead of their usual sniper rifle are far more limited in range but can be very competent in close to medium ranges, especially when they know the bow well enough to compensate for the arc. Also, since the bow has no scope and a much faster charge time, this allows Snipers to keep their peripheral vision and be more towards the frontlines of battle.
</li><li> Soldiers (and to an extent Demomen) can focus their loadout on their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketJump">Rocket Jump</a> abilities, even going for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp">Goomba Stomp</a> tactic.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Like the above TF2 example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch">Overwatch</a></em> is a team-based shooter where each "class" represents a different character in lore. Because of this, all (as of writing) <em>26</em> heroes have different weapons, fighting styles, and abilities, that have been split by the game into four categories (Attacker, Defender, Tank, and Support), and by the community into many, many more. To give some examples:
<ul><li> Reinhardt is a large German man styled after the knights of old. Instead of a gun, he has an oversized rocket-powered hammer and a hard-light shield which can protect his teammates. His primary focus is not pure damage output (in low level play, a "good" Reinhardt will simply hold their shield up and walk forward rather than use their hammer and abilities to try to attack the opposing team), but to protect his teammates.
</li><li> Sombra is a Mexican hacker whose primary ability is to disable the abilities of the enemy team, as well as prevent them from using health packs. Her ultimate, an EMP blast, does this within a large radius. She is also the 'only' hero who can become invisible, which, when combined with her teleporter, shift her focus from damage output, healing, or protection, to stealth and harassment of the other team, while not actually securing many kills herself.
</li><li> D.Va is a South Korean gamer-come-military general who pilots a large mech in combat. In-game, this mech has 600 health, and when destroyed, ejects her into a 150 health form with only her pistol and no other abilities (it should be noted that the standard health for most characters is 200, and only one other has 150). She can eventually regain her mech, and can also deliberately eject in order to self destruct as her ultimate ability, although this leaves her vulnerable for the duration of the ultimate. The devs have noted that because the game treats D.Va in her mech and D.Va out of her mech as two separate characters, she generally has double the amount of bugs as any other hero.
</li><li> Doomfist is a burly Nigerian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser">Genius Bruiser</a> whose kit is built around the titular doomfist, a massive mechanized fist that he wears on his right hand and can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">can supposedly level skyscrapers</a>. His primary fire, a set of four shotguns on the knuckles of his left hand, deal comparatively little damage, are more or less inconsequential to play strategy, and recharge one by one over time instead of being reloaded all at once. Meanwhile, his abilities feel more akin to a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> character than one from <em>Overwatch</em> (including a "Rising Uppercut" very similar to a Shoryuken), and give him a temporary shield of up to 150 health (raising his "total" health to 400, which is that of a tank rather than an offense hero like Doomfist) that fades over time.
</li><li> Roadhog is supposedly a tank, but unlike the rest of the game's tanks, has no deployable shield at all, mostly counting as a Tank by virtue of his HP. His playstyle is closer to that of an Offence character, only slower.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">Borderlands 2</a></em>'s DLC classes were deliberately designed this way (compared to the original 4 classes, all of which focused on shooting with an "action skill" to augment it);
<ul><li> Gaige The Mecromancer was designed as a "Beginner Mode" character (the first skill tree focuses on making things easier, with skills that still do damage to enemies if the player misses or increase their ability to survive) with the option of playing her as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">Difficult, but Awesome</a> instead for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">better results</a> (the last skill tree has skills that deliberately make the player go against what they would normally do in an FPS, such as sacrificing accuracy for higher damage thus forcing them to get up close and discouraging them to avoid manually reloading).
</li><li> Krieg the Psycho uses a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack">Desperation Attack</a> based skills and generally involves taking damage to deal it (one skill tree consists mainly of skills that only work when he's <em>on fire</em>). In addition, he's also the only class which has a melee build as one of the default options (other classes can have them, but they need some optimization). The developers noted that it was because of this reason that he was saved as DLC since his skill-set would likely turn players off compared to the easier to play ones. One of his talents even makes him vulnerable to friendly fire.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BorderlandsThePreSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BorderlandsThePreSequel">Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel!</a></em> features Claptrap the Fragtrap, who boasts a few notable differences from his Vault-hunting contemporaries. First, as a robot, he has no need to breath, so his Oz kit's oxygen reserves don't automatically drain over time in a vacuum. Second, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">as a robot</a>, his metal chassis renders him resistant to Incendiary damage but vulnerable to Corrosive, as opposed to the other way around for his (mostly) human teammates. Finally, his Action Skill, VaultHunter.EXE, functions very differently from any of the other Action Skills in the series, loading up one of several Action Packages based on the current situation. Several of these Action Packages can apply their effects to everyone on Claptrap's team, and even more can be unlocked by investing in the right skills in his skill trees.
</li><li> Compared to previous games, <em>every</em> Vault Hunter in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands3">Borderlands 3</a></em> is this by virtue of having multiple options for their Action Skills that they can switch between freely. They also get special skills called augments, which alter the behavior of their Action Skills but don't cost skill points and can also be swapped in and out freely. And don't think the fun stops there, because they also manage to stand out against each other.
<ul><li> Amara the Siren is the closest to a vanilla Vault Hunter this time around; she only gets to equip one Action Skill at once, and she can equip up to two augments for it. However, one of her augment slots is reserved for augments that control the element of her Action Skill, and none of her augments have restrictions regarding which Action Skills they can be paired with.
</li><li> Zane the Operative gets the option to equip two Action Skills at once, each of which gets two slots for augments. However, in order to equip a second Action Skill, he must give up his ability to throw grenades, and he never unlocks any additional Action Skills beyond his initial three.
</li><li> Moze the Gunner behaves the most similarly to past Vault Hunters in some ways, since her Action Skill always summons her mech, Iron Bear. Instead, her Action Skill options control Iron Bear's weaponry, with one augment slot each for the left weapon and right weapon. She can choose to equip the same weapon to both sides or mix and match, but both sides must be assigned a weapon before she can use her Action Skill.
</li><li> FL4K the Beastmaster gets to choose a pet to summon in addition to an Action Skill and two augments. The pet grants passive bonuses and largely acts autonomously but can be commanded to perform a special attack. Instead of new Action Skill options, FL4K unlocks upgraded versions of their pets instead.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Hexen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Hexen">Hexen</a></em> has three player classes: Mage, Cleric and Fighter. Both the Mage and Cleric rely on ranged weaponry, with only the Cleric's first weapon (a spiked mace) being melee, and the Mage's first weapon (a wand) being ranged <em>and</em> piercing. And then you have the Fighter. Most of the Fighter's weapons are melee, with spiked gauntlets as his first weapon, a magical ax as his second weapon (that does more damage when you have mana, and less when you don't), and his third weapon is a hammer that can be thrown at range if he has mana, but does far more damage in melee. Only his fourth and final weapon, a magical sword, is primarily ranged, doing absolutely no damage in melee, making his later levels after getting the sword mechanically different specifically because he can now fight at range.
</li><li> In both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PlanetSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PlanetSide">PlanetSide</a></em> games, the MAX <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> functions completely differently from the standard armors or classes, exchanging the ability to ride in normal vehicles, heal themselves, and agility for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">massive firepower and durability</a>. In the first game, each empire has 3 MAX suits with an empire specific ability (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualModeUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualModeUnit">anchored mode</a> and berserk, an overshield shield, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpJetPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpJetPack">Jump Jet Pack</a>) each with a unique weapon geared for either anti-air, anti-infantry, or anti-vehicle. For mobility, they could route weapon power to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SprintShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SprintShoes">Sprint Mode</a> to keep up with the slower vehicles. In the sequel, they use customizable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">Guns Akimbo</a> and function fairly similarly, minus the Sprint Mode.
</li><li> Of all people, <em>Samus</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeHunters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeHunters">Metroid Prime: Hunters</a></em> gets this to an extent; having homing missiles instead of a secondary affinity weapon. Weavel is another example, since his Alt mode turns his lower half into a stationary turret instead of simply transforming him into a single entity.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars">Sword of the Stars</a></em>: While all the races have their own unique ways of moving about the strategic map, the Loa have the greatest difference from the rest. They don't build spacecraft normally, instead assembling them from "cubes" at the start of each tactical encounter, and their population growth is based on an interplay of solar activity and tax rate that other races don't have to bother with. They also acheive FTL by building catapult stations that give a big boost up close, but this quickly fades, leaving them to crawl between systems unless they build one at every planet they own.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a> V</em> expansion <em>Brave New World</em> introduces Venice as a playable civ. Unlike other civs, Venice cannot train or capture settlers; instead, it gets the Merchant of Venice, a replacement for the Great Merchant who can purchase and puppetize city-states, as well as being able to maintain twice the number of trade routes as a civilization at the same tech level. Venice is a civ built around the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">one-city challenge</a>, and is essentially a city-state on steroids.
</li><li> The <em>Endless</em> series:
<ul><li> The Harmony in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EndlessSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EndlessSpace">Endless Space</a></em>'s <em>Disharmony</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a> do not utilize Dust, the game's currency, which prevents them from rushing ship production, hiring Heroes, and upgrading ships; in fact, their production is harmed by the presence of Dust. On the other hand, they don't pay upkeep on planets or ships, allowing them to have stupid huge fleets. They do not have empire approval/disapproval, and instead of a dust tax rate they have a "Mind over Matter" rate which allows them to shift food production to science or vice versa. Ship production stops population growth as well. The Broken Lords of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EndlessLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EndlessLegend">Endless Legend</a></em> are an inversion of the Harmony; being a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedArmor">Animated Armor</a>, they do not utilize food and do not have natural population growth, requiring citizens to be built and units healed by expending Dust.
</li><li> Both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EndlessSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EndlessSpace">Endless Space</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EndlessLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EndlessLegend">Endless Legend</a></em> have races that cannot utilize diplomacy and are instead locked into a state of either cold war or war; the Cravers and Necrophages, respectively. The Cravers, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts">Horde of Alien Locusts</a>, must continuously expand or consume their own civilization; their production on a planet is boosted by 25% for 40 turns, normal production after 40, and decreasing production starting at turn 60 (going up to -25%) as they depleted the planet's resources, which cannot be restored. Inverted with the Roving Traders in <em>Endless Legend</em>, which cannot declare war, and rely on diplomacy and their control over markets to get their way.
</li><li> In <em>Endless Space 2</em> most races must establish a temporary outpost in a system they wish to colonize which needs a supply of food from another colony until it can become a full colony. Vaulters and Unfallen skip this phase by instantly establishing a colony via their special mechanics.
<ul><li> Vaulters use a single unique colony ship, the <em>Argosy</em>, which has a high movement rating and can instantly create a colony on any planet. Due to the cooldown period between uses and the fact that the Vaulters only have the one ship, the faction tends to establish fewer colonies but it can afford to spread them out between high quality systems thanks to their instant travel portals.

They have no engine techs <em>at all</em>; instead, they rely on buildings on their planets that boost the speeds of all ships built on that planet. On the one hand, this allows them to cram even more weapons onto their ships than other races, because they're not taking up space with engines, but on the other hand it tends to make them slower and means they can't build ships as quickly since they need to dedicate planet space to ship speed buildings.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>
<ul><li> The Arcanist class is unique, at release, in its ability to equip two different job souls and thus specialize in two drastically different roles; the Summoner Job focuses on damage, while the Scholar Job focuses on healing and support. Other classes only have one job Soul Crystal available. Prior to the introduction of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedMage">The Red Mage</a>, The Summoner is the only DPS job that can resurrect during battle, while the Scholar can more easily apply damage mid-fight than White Mages and do so longer without endangering mana reserves. Being tied to the same class also means that Scholar and Summoner are the only jobs that can be leveled simply by playing a completely different job, though they still have their own separate job questlines.
</li><li> The Bard is an odd combination of damage and support skills, including the only Job skill that can recover ally mana or energy resources, while not having the same damage capabilities as Monks, Dragoons, or Black Mages. They're different enough from other DPS roles that developers have discussed creating a new, hybrid role for them. With <em>Stormblood</em>, the dev team seems to have decided that ranged physical DPS (i.e. Bard and Machinist) are the "support DPS" role, as they share several role actions of this type.
</li><li> Ninjas are unique in their role as some of their abilities are Ninjutsus that aren't accessed as a single action. Instead, they must perform <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandSeals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandSeals">Mudras</a> in a specific order, then use the Ninjutsu skill to activate the effect. Botching a mudra sequence will instead have a rabbit appear on your head for all to see and laugh at you.
</li><li> The three new jobs in the <em>Heavensward</em> expansion are all mechanically unusual in that they do not follow the Class/Job paradigm that all other jobs in the game follow, as well as automatically starting at level 30 when you begin the job. The <em>Dark Knight</em> is a tank job with both incredibly survivability (a lot of their skills focus on keeping themselves alive), as well as above average damage for a tank job, but they are heavily dependent on MP for their abilities (Paladins and Warriors, the other two tank classes, barely use MP at all). <em>Astrologians</em> are powerful healers, but have a random element added to their abilities through card draws. <em>Machinists</em> are the second ranged non-magic DPS job introduced, and until 5.0, were very dependent on their ability to load ammunition to do the most damage, making them burst DPS instead of consistent DPS. The 5.0 update changed Machinists to a more conventional ranged DPS that use their abilities to build up energy and "overheat", which then allows them to use extremely powerful abilities for a short time, keeping the theme of the class (burst DPS), without mechanically restricting base damage output.
</li><li> The two jobs added in <em>Stormblood</em> also follow this pattern (though starting at 50 instead of 30). <em>Samurai</em> is a melee DPS class that relies on combos to build up as many as three special tokens, and then uses those tokens with a special ability to either inflict big damage (one token), attack all enemies in a cone (two tokens) or inflict massive damage (three tokens). <em>Red Mage</em> is a mechanically unusual mage class, which can use both healing and attack spells, allowing them to serve as a back up healer or a primary damage dealer. However, if they can balance their use of white (healing) and black (damage) magic, the Red Mage can build up to more powerful spells, while a Red Mage that fails to balance finds it more difficult to continue their current action (healing gets harder if you heal too much, for example).
</li><li> The Blue Mage, introduced in <em>Stormblood</em> version 4.5, plays completely unlike any other class or job before it. Similar to the class's appearance in previous games, their playstyle revolves around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">Power Copying</a>, replicating the abilities of monsters for their own use. This makes the job highly versatile, so much so that Blue Mages don't really fit anywhere into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamagerHealerTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamagerHealerTank">Damager, Healer, Tank</a> classifications of previous jobs. As such, Blue Mages cannot form parties with random players in Duty Finder, making the job more solo-play focused. In addition, unlike the jobs introduced in <em>Heavensward</em> or the launch of <em>Stormblood</em>, Blue Mages start at level 1, and also have a level cap of 50 (which will be increased incrementally in the future).
</li><li> The two jobs added in <em>Shadowbringers</em> also qualify. The Gunbreaker is a tank job with fewer mitigation abilities than the other tanks, but compensates by having better damage output and a playstyle more akin to a DPS class. The Dancer, meanwhile, is a physical ranged DPS job with not only an array of supportive abilities like a healer, but also several weaponskills that require them to get within melee range of their target.
</li></ul></li><li> Yoshi-P, the lead designer and director of the MMO, has stated that the original Class/Job system is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact">The Artifact</a> and he doesn't like it anymore, but removing it entirely would require rewriting quite a lot of low-level quests, so any new classes or jobs introduced by updates or expansions are now expected to be mechanically unusual by the playerbase.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em>: Starships of Tiers 6 and 5-Upgraded have "starship mastery", which allows your captain to improve their stats by gaining experience flying them. Additionally reaching the fourth mastery level with a T6 unlocks a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkillScoresAndPerks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkillScoresAndPerks">starship trait</a> you can use while flying other ships.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonFighterOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonFighterOnline">Dungeon Fighter Online</a></em> introduced the "Creator" class. While everyone else in the game controls in classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatEmUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatEmUp">Beat 'em Up</a> fashion using the keyboard or gamepad the Creator casts magical abilities with the mouse.

Fallen are infiltrators who must pretend to still be angels long enough for a convenient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStab" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStab">Back Stab</a>, while Redeemed ignore the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaMeter">Mana Meter</a> that everyone else relies on for powers and have to spend points from their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Karma Meter</a> instead.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingChanneler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingChanneler">Revenant</a>. Unlike the other eight professions, the Revenant has an energy cost for most of their skills and cannot freely mix their utility skills, instead using two preset sets of utility skills dependent on the two stances they've equipped.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rift">Rift</a></em>: the Saboteur, a Rogue specialization. Like all Rogues, they utilize the combo system and finishing moves, but the standard Saboteur combo involves placing bombs on the enemy and utilizing the spec's only finishing move, Detonate, which explodes the bombs and deals all their damage at once.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends">League of Legends</a></em> hosts a small percentage of champions that don't use Mana and use either a different resource or none at all, with varying impact on the character as a whole.
<ul><li> Garen, Katarina, and Riven are manaless champions without any secondary resources. This functions similar to having infinite Mana, but cooldown times are crucial to them in exchange.
</li><li> Dr. Mundo, Vladimir, and Zac simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">Cast From Hit Points</a>.
</li><li> All the Ninja champions (Shen, Akali, Kennen, Zed) plus Lee Sin use Energy, which fills fast but depletes just as fast and can't be increased. These champions have skills that can recharge their Energy meter besides waiting as well.
</li><li> Tryndamere, Renekton, Shyvana, and Rek'Sai use Fury, but Fury behaves completely differently for each character, with the only similar theme being it can charge from dealing damage. Fury on Tryndamere gives him extra Critical Strike chance and can be consumed to heal him, Renekton's can use an enhanced skill with enough Fury, and Shyvana's Fury is a glorified cooldown meter for her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a>. Rek'Sai has a damaging skill that scales with Fury or she can use it to heal herself while burrowed.
</li><li> Rumble, Rengar, Gnar, and Yasuo don't rely on a secondary resource overall, but they have something that ties with their skills:
<ul><li> Rumble's skills generate Heat. At above 50%, Rumble's skills deal extra damage, but when the Heat gauge reaches 100%, it disables his skills until all the Heat dissipates but gives his attacks extra damage during the process.
</li><li> Rengar gains Ferocity every time he uses a skill. When it's at 5 stacks, he can cast an enhanced version of his skill with no cooldown.
</li><li> Gnar gains Rage over time or when he deals or takes damage. When he reaches maximum Rage, he can transform into Mega Gnar, a hulking, close-range champion with a new set of skills.
</li><li> Yasuo gains Flow whenever he moves across the battlefield. When his Flow is full, he gains a shield the next time he takes damage.
</li><li> Sett has Grit, a rapidly-depleting resource converted directly from the damage he receives, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector">which he can then unleash back onto his enemies with</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegatonPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegatonPunch">a massive Haymaker punch.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> There are a few champions that lack a "true" Ultimate ability: Elise, Jayce, and Nidalee have a mode-switch, going from Ranged to Melee. Karma's "Ultimate" gives a boost to one of her other abilities.
<ul><li> Udyr is special in that he has 4 (relatively) equal 'Stances' that he uses to cycle between four forms. This makes him the only champion who truly doesn't have an Ultimate ability. Also, in normal games, he is the only champion who cannot max out all his skills.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0dwp2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0dwp2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0dwp2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A champion normally gets 18 skill points to fully distribute among their skills, but Udyr needs 20 skill points to max his skills out</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Graves, Jhin and Aphelios' auto-attacks rely on an ammo system rather than being typically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines">unlimited</a> as is MOBA tradition, and both of them behave in different ways as a tradeoff.
<ul><li> Graves' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeShotgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeShotgun">shotgun</a>, rather than firing a single projectile, instead fires a conic blast of bullets, making him much deadlier in close-range, though he has to reload after two shots.
</li><li> Jhin's attack speed is completely fixed, with any attack speed built just turning into bonus damage. He has to reload after four shots, but every fourth shot is a guaranteed critical hit (crits also give him a burst of movement speed), which eventually stacks up into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass">making him heavy on instant burst damage</a> rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">damage-per-second</a> as with most marksmen.
</li><li> Aphelios has access to <em>five</em> different weapons, carrying two of them at the time, and replacing them when they run out of ammo. Each weapon has different properties, activated ability, and changes the effect of his ultimate. On top of that, he doesn't gain skill points when levelling up, instead using them to directly upgrade his stats.
</li></ul></li><li> Xayah and Rakan aren't that special individually, but they're unique when put together. Both heroes are meant to be paired together, and gain enhanced versions of their skills in combination with the other, as well as a second passive that allows them both to return to base off the same Recall.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfTheStorm">Heroes of the Storm</a></em> likes to push the limits when it comes to MOBA characters, designing lots of heroes to be built around a particular gimmick, which, while very hard for your average beginner to use effectively, can be deadly in the right hands.
<ul><li> Much like in his home universe, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftIIHeartOfTheSwarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftIIHeartOfTheSwarm">Abathur</a> doesn't get involved in the combat directly, instead acting through his teammates via a small zerg organism. He can also place toxic nest mines around the map (globally with the proper talent) to defend objectives. Those are also his only two basic abilities, instead of the normal three. Basically, Abathur is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a>.
</li><li> Playing as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLostVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLostVikings">The Lost Vikings</a> gives you three heroes to play at a time. Each Viking has its own passive (Erik has extra range and speed, Baelog's basic attacks splash, Olaf will occasionally charge at an enemy and regenerates health out of combat). They don't start with ANY abilities, and might never have any basic abilities at all depending on the player's talent choices.
</li><li> Murky is built around the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a> (despite not being from the Starcraft universe). He starts with a health pool of a minion, and deals very little damage, but respawns almost immediately from an egg that can be planted anywhere on the map and awards next to no XP for dying.
</li><li> Rexxar was the game's first ranged warrior hero. He fights alongside his bear companion Misha, who he will use to attack enemies and soak damage while Rexxar attacks from afar. What makes that especially interesting is that the player has no direct control over Misha. Instead, Rexxar needs to give Misha various built-in commands to control her. Notably, most of Rexxar's abilities are based on Misha, so if she dies Rexxar is pretty useless.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleHeadCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleHeadCase">Cho'gall</a> is the first MOBA hero controlled by <em>two</em> players, with each player controlling one of the heads. Cho is a Warrior and controls movement, Gall is a Ranged Assassin and does most of the damage. This of course means that you get an absolute powerhouse on the team, but it also means that the team only has four bodies total. They're also part of the "no-resource" club, likely due to gameplay complications.
</li><li> Tracer's ability set is taken directly from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch">Overwatch</a> (which isn't even part of the same genre), complete with an ammo mechanic for her basic attacks and a Heroic ability charged by dealing damage rather than a cooldown. Additionally, her sole Heroic is unlocked right from level 1, unlike others who have to choose between two Heroic abilities at level 10, with her level 10 talents instead augmenting it in some way. Finally, Tracer was also the first hero in the game who can attack while moving.
</li><li> Deathwing is a very direct way to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayAsABoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayAsABoss">playable boss</a> work in a MOBA. He has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity">Contractual Boss Immunity</a> as a trait, rendering him permanently immune to all crowd control. As a trade-off, allies can't affect him with their abilities, which means he has to rely solely on his own bulk to survive. He can also fly off the map entirely, and land anywhere within vision at any time. If that wasn't enough, he uses energy instead of mana, only has a single Heroic that he starts with out the gate, and has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StanceSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StanceSystem">Stance System</a> for good measure. Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfTheFiftyFootWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfTheFiftyFootWhatever">his model is enormous</a>. For extra flavour, he also has special UI that mimics boss health bars in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>.
</li><li> There's a handful of Heroes who don't use mana as their resource.
<ul><li> Sonya uses Fury, which is generated when she deals or takes damage.
</li><li> Chen uses Brew, which functions like Energy in that it has a static amount of points, but doesn't regenerate naturally. Instead, he needs to stand still and channel his trait in order to recover his Brew.
</li><li> Auriel uses Energy, but it functions very differently. It's gained whenever she or a selected ally deals damage, and it's spent all at once to power up her healing.
</li><li> Valeera, Lt. Morales, and Deathwing use traditional Energy as it's seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends">League of Legends</a></em>.
</li><li> Zarya uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">a third type of Energy</a> that is gained whenever her shields absorb damage. It boosts all of her damage but slowly drains.
</li><li> Gazlowe uses Scrap, which he gains over time and can scavenge extra scrap from his own turrets when they're destroyed.
</li><li> Gul'dan and Probius use mana <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">In Name Only</a>. They both have a small pool and can't regenerate it naturally. Instead, they regain it using their traits. Gul'dan has to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitpoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitpoints">Life Tap</a>, while Probius summons Pylons that regenerate his mana while he stays near them.
</li><li> Many heroes don't use any resource at all, either due to gameplay complications (characters like The Lost Vikings or Abathur) or just as part of their innate skillsets (characters like Illidan and D.Va).
</li></ul></li><li> Mounts are already a unique feature in the game, but some heroes use special variations. Most special mounts function like a fourth basic ability, although others are more akin to passives.
<ul><li> Some heroes instantly gain a massive speed boost, but have to wait through a long cooldown before they can use it again. Sgt. Hammer, The Lost Vikings, and Probius all follow this. Probius' is especially weird, since his comes with a passive speed boost but is cancelled if he takes damage.
</li><li> A few heroes can effectively teleport (often globally), at the downside of having very poor out-of-combat mobility while this is on cooldown. Falstad can fly to a target location, which can potentially be half the map away. Brightwing can teleport to any ally on the map and heal them in the process. Abathur can tunnel to any visible location. Dehaka can tunnel to any bush or vent, and passively gains a movement speed boost while inside of one. Deathwing can leave the map, becoming untouchable in the sky indefinitely, and reactive to land anywhere.
</li><li> Rehgar shapeshifts into a ghost wolf instead of mounting, which is instant and doesn't interrupt his movement to use. Taking damage doesn't cancel the form either. It also causes his next basic attack to lunge at the target for extra damage. To compensate, he only moves at 120% speed instead of 130%.
</li><li> Lunara has <em>no</em> mount ability, instead she has a passive 20% speed bonus. Instead of being a straight bonus, it happens in the form of leaps and bounds (seeing as she's part deer) which make it easy to weave basic attacks between. This bonus is not removed in combat, either.
</li><li> Instead of mounting, Medivh turns into an invulnerable raven that can fly over terrain. This makes him a literally uncounterable scout, although he obviously can't attack in this form.
</li><li> Just like his home game, Lucio gains a movement speed boost while riding on walls. Prior to his rework in 2019, he had no mount ability whatsoever (Wall Ride was his trait instead), just a piece of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlavorText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlavorText">Flavor Text</a> for anyone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">bothering to read the tooltip</a>.
</li><li> D.Va's mount technically has no positive mobility effects - it enables her to basic attack and channel skills while moving, but reduces her movement speed while doing so. She instead uses her Q ability to get around. She can use regular mounts while in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StanceSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StanceSystem">Pilot Mode</a>, however.

<ul><li> Invoker has Quas, Wex and Exort, which simply generate orbs that float around his head, giving him different stat bonuses. By using his ultimate, Invoke, which is automatically learned at level 1 without using a skill point, he gains and can store up to two abilities out of ten, determined by his current combination of orbs.
</li><li> Meepo has an ultimate which creates multiple copies of himself, and can be unlocked at level 3, unlike almost all other ultimates in the game, which are unlocked at level 6 (with the one exception being Invoke).
</li><li> The Techies plays like a trap setter instead of the usual brawling heroes, possessing a skillset dedicated entirely to trap-setting (except for a long-range mobility attack that brings them halfway to death) with very limited capabilities in direct combat. As such, playing as Techies encourage you not to stay in lane very long, but wander in jungle, placing mines in strategic places and hope some poor schmuck stepped on them while trying to reach for other objectives.
</li><li> Rubick is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">Master of None</a> whose spells are less effective compared to other heroes', and the way his ultimate works means most of the time, he doesn't <em>have</em> an ultimate. But decreased effectiveness comes with <em>incredible</em> versatility, and his ultimate is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">Spell Steal</a></em>, allowing him to combo those spells with his own, and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">turning the enemy's own ultimates back at them.</a> Much of Rubick's playstyle is about choosing which enemy spell that can be comboed with his own spell to devastating effects.
</li></ul></li><li> Nitro in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfNewerth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfNewerth">Heroes of Newerth</a></em> originally was the first and only hero to not have a regular autoattack. Instead, one of their skill, Ballistic, serves as a replacement instead, giving them a long-range shot that scales with attack damage and speed and allows them to fire while moving, albeit requiring aiming. They still had access to autoattacking by splitting up into a melee pet and a stationary cannon that fires Ballistic, so they were still able to deny creeps while laning. Unfortunately, the mechanics proved virtually impossible to balance and after a few years they were reworked into having standard autoattacks.
<ul><li> Adrenaline is the closest thing to an "Energy"-based hero in the game. All his skills cost a percentage of his max mana to activate and his passive skill regenerates a relatively huge percent of mana. He still uses mana for everything else such as items, however.

Second, it cannot use its sword, and pressing the button instead uses the character's spell, which is the third point: unlike other characters, who start off with a random spell, this class always starts with a unique spell, which is a projectile attack. Characters of this class also regenerate MP rapidly, unlike most other classes for whom MP is a limited and valuable resource.
</li><li> Hawk in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwentyXX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwentyXX">20XX</a></em>. The other two characters start out with the ability to pick up different weapons for their normal attacks and can only get powers by finishing levels. Hawk, on the other hand, can only wield a whip that drains energy from hostiles and picks up powers from weapon crates.
<ul><li> The other DLC character, Draco, is the opposite: he has a heavy focus on standard weapons, being able to hold several...but paying for this with a reduced supply of power slots. Additionally, instead of charging attacks, he has a number of charge orbs that allow him to use a charged attack with no waiting period, but which take time to recover, with charge modifiers like the Dracopent set instead giving him more and more powerful charge orbs.

<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Bullet.</span> Its starting weapon, Blasphemy, is the only purely melee weapon in the entire game, although it can fire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam">Sword Beams</a> if it has full health. It also starts with a passive item that makes it immune to contact damage and makes rolling into enemies damage them, not only encouraging aggressively rolling into enemies, but makes it immune to any enemy that only damages with contact damage.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Robot as well</span>. It starts with six armor <em>but has no hearts,</em> meaning it has no easy way to keep health up, collecting Junk gives it a stacking additive 5% increase in damage per piece and notable for being the only two abilities in the game that's built into a Gungeoneer rather than being tied to a starting item. To compensate, it starts with the strongest side arm in the game, a passive item that boosts accuracy and makes all shots electrify water pools along with an active item that makes said water pools. To compensate for being unable to gain heart containers, anything that gives one gives one armor instead and Master Rounds give armor equal to the chamber number plus one. Since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Robot</span> doesn't use heart containers, it also takes only one damage from Jammed enemies, making it a good character for cursed runs.
</li></ul></li><li> Several <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac">The Binding of Isaac</a></em> characters operate on different rules than the rest.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">:???/Blue Baby</span> cannot gain any permanent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartContainer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartContainer">Heart Containers</a>, only being able to use the "shielding" soul hearts. This leads to a few items working very differently for him (for example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalStatusBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalStatusBuff">Whore of Babylon</a>, which normally activates at half of a red heart of HP, is always active for him because the game treats him as having zero red hearts).
</li><li> Azazel's tears are replaced with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighPressureBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighPressureBlood">Brimstone laser</a>, which is usually not overridden by other tear effects. While the laser is powerful, it has an absurdly low range even with range upgrades (the normal Brimstone item gives infinite range), meaning he mostly works as a melee class. He's also one of two characters to start with flight.
</li><li> Eden is the "randomizer" character, starting with different items and stats each run. Because of the potential to exploit this via resetting, playing as Eden requires a special currency that is only gotten by beating a late-game boss.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Lost</span> takes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">???</span>'s restriction even further: <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">no hearts</a></strong>. One damaging hit, and you're dead, no questions asked. Compensating for this is an innate ability to fly and shoot wall-piercing tears, being able to freely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a>, and (in the <em>Afterbirth</em> expansion) the Holy Mantle as an unlockable starting item, which takes a single hit per room.
<ul><li> Also in the <em>Afterbirth</em> expansion, they get an extra boon in Greed Mode: they don't take damage when they press the button to pause the wave-spawning timer.
</li></ul></li><li> Lilith wears a blindfold, a special item that prevents her from shooting tears at all. She instead has to rely on familiars, which she has a starting set to take advantage of: an Incubus that follows her around and shoots bullets that copy her tear properties, a usable item that clones her familiars for a single room, and an item that can grant her a permanent new familiar when she takes damage.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Keeper</span> swaps out the standard heart system for two "coin" hearts, which replenish themselves when he picks up money. However, he cannot gain more than his starting two (though he can lose those two in devil deals). He also starts with a triple shot that spreads out wider than the multishot granted by items like The Inner Eye and Mutant Spider.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Forgotten</span> is peculiar, because it acts as two characters rolled into one. It doesn't shoot tears; instead, it has a bone that can be swung as a melee attack, or thrown as a boomerang. It also gets bone hearts (max 6) instead of regular health containers; they can take three hits instead of the usual two, but break irreparably once depleted. The second character, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Soul</span> is a ghost with flight and wall-piercing tears, uses soul hearts (max 6) as health, and can use the first character's now inanimate body as a shield - but it cannot fly too far away from said body. Dying as any of the two automatically kills the other.
</li></ul></li><li> The fangame <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaacAntibirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaacAntibirth">The Binding of Isaac: Antibirth</a></em> provides two bonus character to the vanilla game, both of which are this trope.
<ul><li> Bethany has low starting damage and she cannot use soul hearts, forcing her to rely on regular health containers for survival. Instead, she collects soul hearts and can consume them at will to recharge her active item. Incidentally, she starts with the Book of Virtues, an active item that spawns wisp familiars: combined with Bethany's ability, it can quickly spawn a ton of wisps acting as shields and shooters.
</li><li> Jacob and Esau are two characters controlled at once, each with their own stats (Jacob has more health, Esau more damage), items carried, and abilities (Jacob can move by himself while leaving Esau in place, while the latter can use bombs). Having two characters means having twice the tears and twice the active items at once, but also twice the hitboxes - and, if one of them dies, the other instantly dies too. Also, the duo use so many buttons with their unique control scheme that they can't hold pills, runes, or cards, and instead instantly use them on pickup.
</li></ul></li><li> Every class in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiceyDungeons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiceyDungeons">Dicey Dungeons</a></em> has its gimmick, but some classes stand out in terms of how unique their gameplay is.
<ul><li> The Robot doesn't roll dice at the start of its turn like other classes. Instead, it has to basically play a game of blackjack: it's able to roll an extra die as many times as it wants, but if the total value of the dice exceeds a certain number, all of its moves are disabled for the turn, while hitting the number exactly lets you use a special move.
</li><li> The Witch can "equip" up to six spells in her spellbook, which have to be invoked into her four spell slots by using the appropriate dice before being used. This is quite different from the other characters, whose equipment is there from the start of the fight.
</li><li> The Jester doesn't equip cards like other classes. Instead, it stores its cards in a deck, and draws three of them each turn at random.
</li></ul></li><li> While all characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlayTheSpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlayTheSpire">Slay the Spire</a></em> play differently by virtue of working with different card sets, the Defect has the unique orbs mechanic that the Ironclad and Silent lack. The Defect can use their cards to channel one of four types of orbs in the slots above them during battle, which stick around and activate a passive effect after their turn (Lightning attacks a random enemy, Frost makes extra points of Block, Dark stores attack power that gets released once it's evoked, and Plasma generates Energy used to play cards). If an orb gets pushed off the slots by the addition of another orb, then it activates a stronger "Evoke" effect before disappearing; certain cards can also evoke orbs automatically. The Defect has less direct offense/defense options than the other characters, so playing them well well requires channeling many orbs and evoking them at the right time.

The gun is so powerful that the tank <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualModeUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualModeUnit">must be anchored down before firing</a>. The weapon's range is so great that it extends beyond the vehicle's radar range, requiring a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TargetSpotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TargetSpotter">Target Spotter</a> and some mental arithmetic to judge the weapon's travel time and arc.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarships" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarships">World of Warships</a></em> has the aircraft carrier class, both before and after their overhaul. For all the rest of the ships (cruisers, destroyers, and battleships), each player controls one ship and its armament from a first/third person perspective. But before the overhaul, aircraft carriers played like a real time strategy game, with each carrier player controlling their own ship <em>and</em> a number of squadrons of aircraft from a top-down view. After the overhaul, the player can only control one squadron at a time from a third-person view, and must control the carrier only via waypoints, which is still a wildly different gameplay style from every other ship in the game.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>:
<ul><li> The bard in several editions focuses on his "bard songs", songs that can be used to buff and debuff enemies. Also a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">Master of None</a>, the bard tends to combine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FighterMageThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FighterMageThief">combat, magic and thievery</a> and tends to be pretty terrible at all three unless he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing">decides to specialize in one of those aspects</a>.
</li><li> The psion, in any edition, is basically a wizard but with the gimmick of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaMeter">Mana Meter</a> instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic">Vancian Magic</a>. Prior to 3.5 edition, psionics also had substantially different rules regarding how the powers worked, to the point that they weren't considered magic (and therefore could function in places where magic couldn't) and had different affects based on whether the target was psionic or not.
</li><li> The sorcerer, in 3rd edition, casts spells from level-restricted slots like a wizard but doesn't need to decide what spell a slot will be used for ahead of time. In exchange he has a limited number of spells known, compared to the wizard who can learn new spells through study, or the cleric who knows all cleric spells automatically. The favored soul is an equivalent class for cleric spells. The warmage, healer and dread necromancer combine the sorcerer's spontaneous casting mechanic with knowing every spell on their list like a cleric does... but that list is much smaller and more narrowly focused than those of other spellcasters.
</li><li> The warlock in the 3.5e splatbook, <em>Complete Arcane</em>, has a sharply limited selection of available spells and are locked out of the metamagic system, but can cast them unlimited times per day. The late-edition supplement <em>Dragon Magic</em> did another class using the same spellcasting system, though (the Dragonfire Adept).
</li><li> In the 4th edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>, where most of the earlier classes represent a particular fantasy archetype, most of the later classes mainly exist because of a certain mechanical gimmick, and share archetypes with an earlier class. For instance, the avenger (gimmick: roll twice for each attack, same archetype as paladin), psion (as above), runepriest (gimmick: switch between offensive and defensive mode at will, same archetype as cleric), and the fact that there are two different classes named 'assassin' both with a different gimmick.
</li><li> In some early editions, the thief class itself as the only one with explicit (percentile-based) <em>skills</em> would fit the bill.
</li><li> And <em>then</em> there are 3.5 edition binders, who are not only quite dissimilar to the other classes, but can very easily end up quite dissimilar to themselves yesterday. Essentially, a binder gains powers by forming a pact with mysterious entities from outside reality; they can change pacts every day or so, and this brings with it a shift in special powers and bonus feats. The same book binders were from had two other new magic systems, but shadowcasters were comparatively standard (their primary mechanical gimmick was their spells becoming gradually easier to use, not just stronger and usable more often, as they levelled up) and truenamers were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">fundamentally unworkable</a> because their skill check-based magic system went up in difficulty considerably faster than the player's skill could without a magic item granting a huge bonus to the Truename skill.
</li><li> The 3.5e splat <em>Magic of Incarnum</em> adds an "essentia" mechanic, which revolves around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivertingPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivertingPower">Diverting Power</a> between the user's abilities from round to round, as well as a whole new magic category called meldshaping, which allows the user to enchant themselves with spectral equipment called soulmelds. Soulmelds can optionally be filled with essentia to increase their strength, or equipped in the user's magic item slots to unlock new abilities.
</li><li> Also from 3.5e, <em>The Tome of Battle</em> was infamous for its mechanical and tonal shift, being more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wuxia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wuxia">Wuxia-influenced</a> than other D&amp;D splatbooks had been up to that point. The class put both implicitly and overtly supernatural and magical abilities into the hands of melee combatants, breaking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards">a divide that was somewhat baked into the system</a> by that point. The difference in both mechanics and theme lead to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nickname</a>: "<em>The Tome of Weeaboo Fightan Magic</em>". The biggest divide in the fandom was yet to come, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo">as the Tome of Battle represented the paradigm going forward into 4e</a>.
<ul><li> Within the Tome of Battle itself, the Crusader uses a completely unique mechanic to determine its abilities from round-to-round: they <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightLikeACardPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightLikeACardPlayer">shuffle and draw cards</a></em>, rather than anything die-based or otherwise self determined.
</li></ul></li><li> In 5th edition, warlocks are unusual among spellcasters for a few reasons. Instead of gaining additional spells per day for each individual spell level as they level up, warlocks have very few spell slots to begin with, and gain very few over their careers-however, these slots automatically scale to the highest spell level that the warlock can cast, so weak spells can be automatically strengthened, and strong spells can be used as needed. Additionally, warlocks are the only spellcasters that refresh their spell slots after a Short Rest-so long as they stop to take a breather once in a while, they'll always have magic at the ready, not just after a full night's sleep.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>:
<ul><li> Alchemicals are a mechanically unusual <em>splat</em> which have the unique ability to trade out their Charms during downtime, while Lunars are the only ones with a shapeshifting system. Sidereals may also qualify, given that their gimmick is founded on having an incredibly weird interpretation of their skills - their Medicine tree is used to kill undead, while Archery has a Charm that allows them to shoot health at someone, and their best persistent Dodge enhancer is in Performance.
</li><li> The previews for third edition indicate that the Infernals are going to have their own unusualness in the form of the Shintai system, which has gone from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a> Charms to a point buy system with effects based on the Charms you buy, and the new Exigents are going to be unusual because they will be focused on designing your own powers rather than starting with ones that already exist.
</li><li> The fighting-game-inspired <em>Burn Legend</em> shard has the Ryuujin (Terrestrial-equivalent), Okami (Lunar-equivalent) and Tennin (Sidereal-equivalent) as the most unusual options, with most of the rest having a relatively straightforward moveset with maybe some discounts or unusual side effects. Earth, Air, Fire and Water Ryuujin have two levels of technique, and need to invest in the lower levels to unlock the higher: Earth has Metal, Air has Lightning, Fire has Shadow, and Water has Ice (Wood Ryuujin can take the base techniques of any other kind, but not the higher-level ones). The Okami have different moves depending on whether they're in their human or beast form, although since you buy them from the same point pool and beast moves are more powerful, generally they just go werewolf in the first round and stay that way unless there's a really good reason not to. Tennin are the only ones with a three-tier system that matters in play: you need to use tier one moves to be able to use tier two in the next round, and tier two moves unlock a tier three (their moves get more dice in their pools to compensate for the loss of flexibility).
</li></ul></li><li> The Ghost faction from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SmashUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SmashUp">Smash Up</a></em>. For most other factions (and most card games), it is favourable to have more cards on hand. The Ghost faction requires the player to have as <em>few</em> cards on hand in order to be at their most effective, and even have cards that force discarding from hand. However, their cards are very powerful when used right, including playing from the discard pile, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a> action, and an action that makes a minion an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntangibleMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntangibleMan">Intangible Man</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ThirteenthAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ThirteenthAge">13th Age</a></em> has the Occultist from "13 True Ways". Unlike most other classes, which do things in their turn, the Occultist mostly gathers Focus in its own turn, then expends that Focus to power a move in someone else's turn depending on the circumstances of the battle and the actions their allies are taking. They do get a Focus-expending attack that allows them to discharge it at the start of their turn if they haven't had a power triggered, then charge it up again with their standard action.
<ul><li> From the same book comes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMagic">Chaos Mage</a>, which knows all of their spells by default (and casts them at the highest possible level they can), but has very limited control over <em>what</em> spell they're going to cast. They can also inflict bizarre and uncontrollable effects on the battlefield, like a living Rod of Wonder.
</li><li> The Monk is unusual, because they like the tabletop version of a fighting game character. They have three levels of attack (Jab, Punch, and Kick), and fight by chaining together combos of martial arts level abilities. The Drunken Monk variant is even more unusual, because (like the chaos mage) they have almost no control over what kind of move they're going to do next!
</li><li> Really, this applies to almost every 13th Age class to some degree; from the Barbarian's mechanic of rolling 2d20s (and critting if they both hit and exceed 11), to the Necromancer's ability of becoming more powerful if they spend a full round monologuing... It's a weird game.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>:
<ul><li> More than a few archetypes are designed to be one of these:
<ul><li> Crystal Beasts are placed in your Spell/Trap Zone as Continuous Spells when they're destroyed. Their support grants various effects based on the number of Crystal Beasts you have either on the field or treated as Spell Cards.
</li><li> Dark World monsters are designed around being discarded by an effect, and Fabled monsters are designed around being discarded for any reason. Their support cards generally focus on helping them discard.
</li><li> Elemental HERO Neos and the Neo-Spacian monsters, as well as Gladiator Beasts and later introduced Contact Fusion archetypes, are capable of being summoning Fusion Monsters via Contact Fusion; despite being Fusion Monsters, they don't use Fusion Spells, and aren't treated as being Fusion Summoned.
</li><li> Exodia the Forbidden One is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition">Instant-Win Condition</a> that triggers the instant you have all five pieces in your hand, without you actually having to play anything. This is the only way you can win the game before either player has a chance to play any cards.
</li><li> Fire Kings either destroy (<em>not</em> discard) other cards in your hand or destroy themselves, or have effects that trigger when they're destroyed. Their support cards focus on destroying them.
</li><li> Infernity monsters, like the Ghost faction in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SmashUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SmashUp">Smash Up</a></em>, require the player to empty their hand to use their effects.
</li><li> Most Infernoids can't be summoned without banishing other Infernoids from your Hand or Graveyard.
</li><li> Lightsworn monsters and their support send cards from your deck directly to the Graveyard. This is a boon to many archetypes or decks that require certain cards be in the graveyard.
</li><li> PSYFrame monsters are designed to Synchro Summon during your opponent's turn instead of your own, using their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieldPowerEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieldPowerEffect">field spell</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Gemini Monsters are Effect Monsters, but have an effect that causes them to be treated as Normal Monsters while on the field or in the Graveyard. They can be Normal Summoned a second time, while already on the field, to give them their Effect Monster effects; if their effect is negated while they're treated as a Normal Monster, this also causes them to be treated as an Effect Monster, but doesn't give them their Effect Monster effects.
</li><li> Pendulum Monsters as a whole usually go to the Extra Deck instead of the Graveyard when they leave the field, and a great deal of their support revolves around destroying them. They can also be played as a Pendulum Scale, which is treated as a type of Continuous Spell instead of a monster and they cannot be set on Pendulum Zones.
</li><li> Link Monsters' main gimmick revolves around providing new Extra Monster Zones, but this makes them necessary for any deck that focuses on summoning multiple monsters from the Extra Deck due to the rule changes in the <em>VRAINS</em>-era.
</li></ul></li><li> Each warcaster and warlock in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/IronKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/IronKingdoms">Warmachine</a> plays differently from one another. Having different spells and abilites, but a few stick out.
<ul><li> The Butcher's second version generates his Focus points at random unless he destroyed models in the previous turn, and attacks <em>everything</em> in range, friend or foe, when he makes a melee attack.
</li><li> Karchev is encased within a warjack, giving him the abilities and attributes of both a heavy jack and a warcaster.
</li><li> Jeremiah Kraye makes warjacks in his army behave like cavalry with increased maneuverability and speed.
</li><li> Sturm and Drang are a lab built creature whose two sides are constantly fighting for dominance. With different spells and abilities depending on which side is in control.
</li><li> The Convergence of Cyriss faction's warjacks act completely different depending on which warcaster is controlling them. Gaining the melee and ranged attack skill of the warcaster, in addition to each one giving their warjacks a different ability. Melee focused warjacks being useless in one warcaster's hands but fantastic with another.
</li><li> The Grymkin's Defiers function like warlocks, but do not have Feats like regular warlocks and warcasters. Instead they have "Arcana", abilities which are triggered by events and conditions in game.
</li><li> Khador armies in general. Most Warmachine armies have a mixture of lighter, skirmishing warjacks and heavier, damage-dealing warjacks, and generally have at least one unit with an arc node to channel spells. Khador, due to a near-complete lack of arc nodes and a serious lack of cortexes, builds <em>every</em> warjack on the template of "giant slab of murderous iron", and has no arc nodes on anything unless you count "axe to the face" as a spell.
</li></ul></li><li> The Doomed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MasksANewGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MasksANewGeneration">Masks: A New Generation</a></em> is defined by an oncoming grim fate that, apart from people playing the Transformed who pick a very specific advancement option, nobody else really has. This not only puts a limit on how long a Doomed character is playable (if your doom track fills up too often, <em>you die</em>), but also changes the standard options every other playbook gets; everyone else, even the Transformed, can shift to another playbook as a higher-experience advancement option, but for the Doomed, this plays out more like a controlled detonation where they trigger a confrontation with their fate in a setting where they get a chance to survive, <em>then</em> they're allowed to change playbooks. (The "retire character" option, incidentally, shifts from "retire from the life or become a paragon of the city" to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotGoGentle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotGoGentle">become a paragon of the city for as long as you have left</a>".)
</li><li> Each Skin in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MonsterHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MonsterHearts">Monster Hearts</a> has variations on the basic template, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">the Infernal's</a> bargains or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">the Fae's</a> promises. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel">The Angel</a> takes the cake, though, as it has no Dark stat. Instead they have a sliding scale of Trespass and Forgiveness that shows how much they have fallen.
</li><li> The UM-R60 <em>UrbanMech</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> is a bizarre little 'Mech that is usually met with derision and scorn, because it is a light 'Mech (30 tons) that's incredibly slow in a game about big stompy robots with lots of weapons running around and blowing things up. The <em>UrbanMech</em>, by contrast, is small, slow, and has only two weapons, one of which is limited to 8 rounds of ammunition before it becomes worthless. However, that one weapon is an AC/10, one of the biggest guns available, which can headshot any 'Mech if the pilot gets lucky, and can severely damage Heavy and Assault 'Mechs and outright kill Medium and Light 'Mechs. It's also got some of the heaviest armor of any Light 'Mech, which means it has durability. Sure, it looks funny and doesn't drive well and can't withstand an extended engagement. But if it's piloted correctly, it can be surprising as hell. And if it's part of a lance that's using its abilities to the fullest (ambush tactics), then it can be <em>deadly</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TwilightImperium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TwilightImperium">Twilight Imperium</a></em> (4th ed) contains 17 playable factions, each with a different playstyle, but a few standout here:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloneArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloneArmy">The Brotherhood of Yin</a> are roughly similar to others in their general playstyle, but their flagship is unique. Instead of being a powerful addition to their fleets, the "Van Hauge" is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MolotovTruck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MolotovTruck">weapon of mass desctruction</a> that will destroy everything in its system if it dies. This leads to it being treated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack">like a missile</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">The Nekro Virus</a>, can't research technology on their own. Instead they must <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAssimilator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAssimilator">steal technology</a> from other players by destroying their ships or manipulating politics; though as a trade-off, they can steal techs that are normally faction exclusive. Speaking of politics, their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">"Galactic Threat"</a> means they can't cast votes during political phases. Both of these traits to lead a very different playstyle from other factions.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlantAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlantAliens">The Arbortec</a> can't produce infantry at their space docks; instead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienReproduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienReproduction">their infantry have Production</a> - they are able to grow their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShip">organic spaceships</a> or more troops directly out of their existing ground troops (or flagship). These differences encourage a very different approach to producing units from other factions.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess">Chess</a></em>, the Knight is this. Due to their unique way of moving, they're the only pieces who can threaten a queen without exposing themselves to said queen.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder13');">    Third Person Shooter </div><div class="folder" id="folder13" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em>: towards the beginning, all the 'frames followed a basic pattern. Four abilities, with the first one being a quick-and-dirty tool for damage, two more utility-focused powers, and an "ultimate" power for either damaging and stunning crowds or a more powerful version of the first power. After about twenty 'frames, though, things started to get stranger:
<ul><li> Vauban the engineer was the first step towards unorthodoxy. While other Warframes cast their powers more like spells, Vauban throws grenades with special effects.
</li><li> Zephyr was the very first Warframe to get a passive ability. As the wind-themed Warframe, she is constructed from the ultra-light Oxium alloy, causing gravity to affect her less. However, all Warframes were eventually given passive abilities, ultimately leaving her fairly ordinary.
</li><li> Limbo's entire gimmick is that he can access an intermediate plane of existence between normal space and the void, an ability called "rift-walking". Limbo can enter and exit this plane at will and while inside it he is intangible, though still visible, to everyone in normal space and regenerates energy while inside the rift. The downside is that he cannot affect objects in normal space in return, having to go back "into phase" in order to attack enemies, hack terminals, open containers, or collect item drops. His first and fourth abilities allow him to "banish" enemies (or even an overwhelmed ally) into the rift, temporarily taking them out of the fight and allowing him to divide and conquer large groups of enemies or single out particularly troublesome foes.
</li><li> Chroma, being based off the chromatic dragons from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>, can utilize different elements depending on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedElements" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedElements">his primary emissive color</a>. Reds, oranges, and yellows give him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">Heat</a> damage, blues and purples give him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">Electric</a> damage, greens give him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonousPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonousPerson">Toxin</a> damage, and grayscale tones give him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson">Cold</a> damage. This also alters the secondary effects of his Elemental Ward power, making him almost like four Warframes in one.
</li><li> Equinox is a big walking yin-yang in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyHuman">humanoid</a> form. By using Metamorphosis, she can switch between the offense-oriented Day form — which can debilitate enemies, buff the damage of allies, and spread a damaging aura to stun/shred everything — and the defense-oriented Night form — which can immobilize enemies, debuff the damage of enemies, and spread a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain">Life Drain</a> aura to heal teammates. Her energy color affects which form she'll default to at the start of missions.
</li><li> Inaros has no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegeneratingShieldStaticHealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegeneratingShieldStaticHealth">shields</a> whatsoever, but in addition to two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain">Life Drain</a> powers to make up for it he doesn't die in the traditional way, utilizing a sarcophagus to drain health from nearby enemies. Drain enough, and he can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">revive himself</a>. He also starts out with more health than any other Warframe can reach without mods, making him truly stand out from the crowd.
</li><li> Nidus, like Inaros, has absolutely no shields, but he offsets this by being the only Warframe with innate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegeneratingHealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegeneratingHealth">Regenerating Health</a>, averting the game's standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegeneratingShieldStaticHealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegeneratingShieldStaticHealth">Regenerating Shield, Static Health</a>. Furthermore, his powers involve juggling a secondary, unique resource, and building up enough can let him ignore lethal damage, regaining 50% health and becoming invincible for a few seconds instead.
</li><li> Octavia is the most unusual yet, a music themed frame who has powers such as a rolling disco ball that entrances enemies and a device that deals certain types of damage on certain notes of the songs that players program into it.
</li><li> Khora was originally intended to have two unique gimmicks. First, as the beast tamer, she would constantly have a unique Kavat named Venari by her side that would interact with her powers. Second, she would be able to rotate between three forms based on the physical damage types<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1gz7v');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1gz7v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1gz7v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Impact, Puncture, and Slash</span>; one form would be dedicated to offense, another to crowd control, and the last to healing. Ultimately, only the former came to fruition, as the latter was tied to an attempt at reworking the physical damage types that was scrapped after players responded poorly.
</li><li> Hildryn is thus far the only Warframe to completely lack an energy pool, instead relying on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitpoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitpoints">her massive shields</a> to fuel her powers and melee channeling. In order to support this, she gets a few extra shield-related perks. First, picking up energy orbs replenishes her shields if they are not full, although no other form of energy regeneration has any effect for her. Her shields also grant her a few forms of extra protection; overshields prevent any damage from ignoring her shields, her health can't be depleted if her shields were damaged by a given hit, and losing her shields entirely grants her a short burst of invincibility, although her shields must fully recharge before the effect can trigger again.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder14');">    Tower Defense </div><div class="folder" id="folder14" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Specialists in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Arknights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Arknights">Arknights</a></em> act differently from the seven other Operator classes. The specifics vary from operator to operator, but they can be broadly separated into several subcategories:
<ul><li> Fast-redeployment Specialists have extremely low deployment costs and have very quick redeployment cooldown. They are mostly used to plug breaches in your defenses or kill off stragglers.
</li><li> Shift Specialists are able to reposition enemy units with their attacks, often pushing/pulling them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit">Bottomless Pits</a>. They are also able to be placed on low and high grounds.
</li><li> Stealth Specialists have lower chances to be targeted by enemies, as well as having innate physical and magical dodge chance.
</li></ul></li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder15');">    Turn-Based Strategy </div><div class="folder" id="folder15" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Psy-Ops in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2">XCOM 2</a></em> are quite different from your other classes: they level up through training instead of completing missions and killing aliens, and the abilities they learn are semi-randomly selected. They can even participate in missions while training, the only caveat being that their training will be postponed if they need to recover from injuries. They are the only class that is capable of learning every single ability available to them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">given enough time</a> (in contrast to the other classes, which are given a choice between two different abilities for each level). Additionally, their accuracy with weapons pales in comparison to other classes, making them more reliant on their psychic abilities.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AtlasReactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AtlasReactor">Atlas Reactor</a></em> has a number of characters with very different or unusual skills for their character type and end up playing differently or picking up hybrid roles as a result:
<ul><li> Juno is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">firepower</a> without a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapeBattleTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapeBattleTechnique">dash move</a>, but instead has a personal shield that soaks damage. Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">ultimate ability</a> costs 50 energy to activate instead of 100 and can be kept on during subsequent rounds for a cost of 20 energy.
</li><li> Rask's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">ultimate ability</a> cannot be manually activated by the player and fires off automatically at any round in which Rask starts with full energy, resetting all of Rask's cooldowns in the process. Rask also gains energy by being attacked instead of just by attacking like all other freelancers.
</li><li> Quark is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtilityPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtilityPartyMember">support</a> who has no cooldown skills and whose healing skills can't target themselves. Instead of using powerful single-target heals or attacks with cooldown, Quark uses their primary moves to 'bond' to friendly or hostile characters and deal/heal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualGrinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualGrinder">small amounts of damage over time</a>. Quark also gains small amounts of health from a third move that boosts these bonds for a single round.
</li></ul></li><li> The Dancer class in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em>. Dancing allows another character to make a second action that turn. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance">Path of Radiance</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn">Radiant Dawn</a></em>, herons have a similar role.
<ul><li> Merlinus' Transporter class from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBlazingBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBlazingBlade">The Blazing Blade</a></em> is one of the biggest examples of this in the series. After recruiting him, you have the option to deploy Merlinus in any chapter. He's an immobile tent who can't fight, but as long as he's on the map any items obtained by a character with a full inventory can be sent directly to storage (they'd have to drop something otherwise), and any character adjacent to his tent can access the storage. Unlike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath">all other characters</a>, Merlinus is not gone for good if he's defeated in battle, he'll return no worse for wear in the next chapter. Because he can't fight he follows unconventional leveling mechanics: Merlinus automatically levels up every time he survives a chapter, and once he reaches Lv 20 he upgrades to a horse cart and finally gains the ability to <em>move</em>. And while his combat stats are useless, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">he eventually gains large amounts of Speed and Luck, making him a very effective evasion-tank.</a> He retains his cart in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBindingBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBindingBlade">The Binding Blade</a></em>, but now takes up a deployment slot and can only gain levels from dodging enemies.
</li><li> Xane's Chameleon/Freelancer class from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemShadowDragonAndTheBladeOfLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemShadowDragonAndTheBladeOfLight">Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemMysteryOfTheEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemMysteryOfTheEmblem">Mystery of the Emblem</a></em>. He is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DittoFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DittoFighter">Ditto Fighter</a> who can shapeshift into any other ally (except Manaketes) for five turns, with all of the abilities thereof.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FellSealArbitersMark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FellSealArbitersMark">Fell Seal: Arbiter's Mark</a></em>, most classes level up and learn new abilities by spending AP in their skill trees. The Gadgeteer class is different: while it learns its passive skills and counter ability this way, it can only learn its <em>active</em> abilities by crafting Gadgets in the Troops menu, or by finding Gadgets in treasure chests on the battlefield.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic">Heroes of Might and Magic</a></em>: In <em>II</em> and <em>III</em>, the Necromancer/Necropolis' heroes stand out by being the only hero type(s) to have a skill specifically associated with them, Necromancy (it works exactly the same if other heroes have it, but baring customised scenarios no other heroes start with it, and it will never be offered as a skill to be learned upon level up for any other heroes) and by their associated units (which the Necromancy skill gives them more of) all utterly ignoring morale (and imposing an additional morale penalty on other units in the army beyond the 'mixed alignment' penalty).
