</div></li><li> Murtaugh is suspected of this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LethalWeapon4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LethalWeapon4">Lethal Weapon 4</a></em>. It is mentioned offhand that Internal Affairs got an anonymous tip that he is taking bribes, an accusation nobody takes seriously. But then Riggs notices him casually ending out large sums of money to his kids and Roger gets evasive about it, not to mention his nice suits, nice boats, nice house (though given it gets destroyed in both this and the 2nd movie, it got a <em>lot</em> of remodelling), etc. Riggs eventually gets around to grilling him about why this is so on a cop's salary. It turns out the money is coming mostly from Murtaugh's wife, who is a very successful (if somewhat cheesy) romance novelist. Murtaugh wouldn't admit it because his friends would <em>never</em> let him live it down.
</li><li> The movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SayAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SayAnything">Say Anything...</a></em> has this as a major part of the plot - the IRS is investigating Diane's father for tax evasion, fraud, and money laundering. Diane's discussion with the agent handling the case is a great rundown on trying to find someone doing this.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goodfellas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goodfellas">Goodfellas</a></em>, Jimmy berates a fellow conspirator in the Lufthansa heist for buying his wife a fur coat and a conspicuous pink Cadillac. Jimmy says that he specifically told everyone <em>not</em> to make big purchases yet because the cops will be watching them in particular, and does not care when the man tries to defend the purchase by saying that the car is under his mother-in-law's name. Henry is given a small share and is likewise told not to spend it, to which he agrees, but the movie then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GilliganCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GilliganCut">Gilligan Cuts</a> to him shouting to his family that he bought the most expensive Christmas tree he could. General fear about the problems associated with this trope, in addition to simple greed, leads to Jimmy having most of the co-conspirators killed in lieu of payment.
</li><li> This happens near the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePinkPanther1963" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePinkPanther1963">The Pink Panther (1963)</a></em> when Clouseau is suspected of being the jewel thief. When questioned in this matter about how his wife (who is actually the thief) is able to afford such expensive clothing, on his police salary, Clouseau naively asserts that she's very frugal with the housekeeping budget.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DialMForMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DialMForMurder">Dial M for Murder</a></em>, the cops begin to suspect Tony of something when he starts buying everything in cash, in used one-pound notes.
</li><li> The surviving robbers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeadPresidents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeadPresidents">Dead Presidents</a></em> are caught because one of them starts spending the stolen money right away and way beyond his means. There is a good chance that he did it because he was feeling guilty for all the deaths they caused and wanted to be caught.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanGangster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanGangster">American Gangster</a></em>, Frank Lucas first attracts police attention when he's spotted in the front row of a high profile boxing match wearing a mink coat.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSting">The Sting</a></em>, Hooker blows through his entire stake of a large con job in a single afternoon, which alerts the villain to his identity.

Lee quickly catches on to the criminal activities going on in the base when he notices that Pvt. Garcia is wearing a very expensive watch he has no business of having based on his salary.

Vizla is indicated to have earned millions of dollars as a hitman, but he lives in a quiet mountain cabin and keeps a low profile. This is because Vizla is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">Properly Paranoid</a>; another hitman who <em>did</em> retire to spend his money on a luxurious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookersAndBlow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookersAndBlow">Hookers and Blow</a> lifestyle is easily tracked down and killed off.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFrenchConnection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFrenchConnection">The French Connection</a></em>, Popeye and Cloudy, while relaxing at a bar after a shift, notice a small-time diner owner racking up a large bill with a lawyer known to work with drug dealers, then look into his finances and find he doesn't make very much. This reveals a smuggling operation, putting the film's plot in motion.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ElCamino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ElCamino">El Camino</a></em>: Todd used his cut of Walt's drug money to buy himself a huge apartment, a flatscreen TV with speakers, and lots of kitsch furniture, pretty much what you'd expect from a young criminal who struck it big (and clearly isn't into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookersAndBlow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookersAndBlow">Hookers and Blow</a>). At this point, he has no clear legal source of income, and he wouldn't have been able to afford it in his previous job as a pest exterminator either. Still, it seems he managed to stay under the radar until after his death.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhosMindingTheMint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhosMindingTheMint">Whos Minding The Mint</a></em>: Plays with this. The main character (a treasury employee in charge of printing off new money) is accused of being an embezzler, due to his constantly-changing expensive cars and clothes. In fact, all he's actually doing is always buying new stuff and then returning it before the 30-day warranty expires to get his money back, before getting another expensive suit or car somewhere else and doing the same thing over again. He has nothing to hide from the auditors, at least until one sheet of new money is accidentally used to wrap up some brownies he got, ruining them and forcing him to break back into the mint after hours with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">Ragtag Bunch of Misfits</a> to print off a replacement sheet of money (as well as payment for his team).
</li><li> Averted at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OceansEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OceansEleven">Ocean's Eleven</a></em>. When Danny is released on parole, the other members of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaperCrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaperCrew">Caper Crew</a> pick him up in an ordinary car.

<ul><li> <em>The Valley of Fear</em> had Holmes mention that Professor Moriarty owned a painting worth many times over his legitimate annual income. At the time, this was the most tangible piece of evidence Holmes could find against Moriarty.
</li><li> One of the clues in <em>Silver Blaze</em> was that the murder victim had a bill in his pocket that a) wasn't on his name (but had to be his, since very few people carry the bills of others) and b) was a sum he could hardly afford.

</li><li> In the <em>Prey</em> novel series by John Sandford, Lucas Davenport is a cop who has a fancy house, nice suits, a Porsche and millions of dollars, but that's because he <em>writes roleplaying games</em> in his off-time. Who knew?
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDaVinciCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDaVinciCode">The Da Vinci Code</a></em>. A Swiss banker is impersonating a truck driver to help Langdon and Sophie escape the police. When the cops pull him over and ask what the "driver" is doing with a Rolex, he claims it is actually a 'Folex' knockoff and offers to sell it to the inquisitive officer for a paltry sum.

Afterwards, Stottlemeyer looks rather uneasy whenever he's around Rollins, especially when Rollins confronts him about why he did not show up at the morgue to help identify a body that matched Monk's profile but turned out to be a dud (potentially planted by Stottlemeyer). Once Rollins leaves, Stottlemeyer privately tells Randy that he didn't go to the morgue to ID the body not because he knew it was a dud, but because he was doing a background check on Rollins for Monk, and has found more solid evidence that Rollins is dirty: he's bought a second house, a new expensive BMW sedan, and he has two offshore bank accounts, on a county sheriff's meager salary.

<ul><li> This becomes an ongoing problem for Walt. Initially all the money he makes cooking meth goes toward his medical bills so people do not notice that he is spending way more than he earns as a high school teacher. When people start to notice, Skyler (with Walt reluctantly playing along) concocts a story about winning the money by playing blackjack (this is the explanation Skyler gives to Marie so that she and Walt can use some of his drug money to pay for Hank's hospital bills), which is supported by having Saul arrange for some casinos to report false losses and documentation. Walt then buys the car wash he used to work at and assigns Skyler to run the place and launder the drug money, but it soon proves to be insufficient. In the end, Walt has barrels full of cash and is unable to spend any of it.
</li><li> With her background in accounting, Skyler is very aware of this trope and occasionally has to rein in Walt. Sometimes this is reasonable (as when she makes him return the sports cars he got for himself and Walter Jr.), but she also takes it to extremes (when she takes exception to Walt spending a couple hundred dollars on a fancy bottle of wine, not an unreasonable expense considering he bought it to celebrate spending several **hundred thousand dollars** to buy the car wash).
</li><li> Jesse has a similar problem as Walt but is generally less careful with his spending. However, the DEA already knows that he is a low-level drug dealer so him having extra money does not come as much of a surprise to them and they never suspect the scale of his involvement.
</li><li> Gus Fring is a master in avoiding this trope. He has a large portfolio of legitimate businesses (Los Pollos Hermanos, Lavenderia Brilliante, etc.) to hide the income from his drug empire and aid in drug production. He is also being bankrolled by Madrigal Electromotive, a major German conglomerate. However, he spends less on himself than his legitimate businesses could realistically generate by themselves. We eventually learn that Gus's whole enterprise is geared toward revenge rather than material gain.
</li><li> After Gus's death, an attempt by Walt, Jesse, and Mike to destroy surveillance footage from the lab results in the DEA discovering a list of offshore bank accounts Gus was using to pay off the employees of his operation, most notably a large $2 million account set up in the name of Mike's granddaughter. Hank and Gomez haul Mike in to interrogate him but point out that they're not arresting him because, as Hank points out, Mike never touched the money in his account, giving him plausible deniability as to the account's existence. Hank points out that all the other henchmen involved spent the money on themselves and thus it was used to prove their involvement. Mike was saving the money for his granddaughter and was content to live on his (apparently very meager) legit salary.

However, he's kind of an idiot. By that, we mean, he uses his drug money to buy himself a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HummerDinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HummerDinger">BRIGHT YELLOW pimped-out Hummer H2 with red flames on the side and spinning rims</a>. Knowing how such blatant spending attracts police attention, Mike immediately stops providing bodyguard service to Daniel the moment he first shows up for a drug deal in the car (especially since Daniel refuses to ride in Mike's more subtle 1980s Chrysler). It also makes the cops who show up to a burglary report at his house feel suspicious about him. When it turns out Daniel called the cops because Nacho stole his baseball cards in addition to his cash, Mike goes to Nacho and arranges a deal: Nacho gets Daniel's Hummer, he and Mike then net about $60,000; while Daniel gets his baseball cards back plus $10,000 in cash. Daniel hands over the keys to Nacho and gives him detailed information on how to take care of the car. Nacho promptly announces his intention to destroy the Hummer at a chop shop, because he is wise enough to not be caught driving a vehicle that, in his words, "looks like a school bus for six-year-old pimps".

As such, he had his people follow him to take note of him purchasing the kind of things an infant would need—diapers, formula, etc. Much to his surprise and disappointment, Tony did no such thing, leading Jason to think he was wrong. As it turns out, Tony <em>had</em> kidnapped the baby, but already had the things necessary—he and Carly had been engaged and living together up until a few weeks before she delivered the baby—and therefore, he didn't invoke this trope. He's caught when Robin Scorpio picks up a receipt he's dropped and she sees that's it's for the purchase of an infant medication.

Frank knows that the media will likely accuse Weems of being corrupt, so he summons Weems to 1PP for an interview and Weems explains that the extra money is because he runs a side business flipping real estate. However, Frank is skeptical, and at his insistence, Gormley digs deeper and finds that Weems skimped on many of his real estate deals through cutting corners and illegal evictions. Gormley ultimately decides not to fire Weems but leaves him with a stern warning that he won't be so lucky if he's caught cutting corners again.

Pullo considers keeping the gold for themselves and goes on a spending spree around the city, visiting dozens of taverns and giving away money for free. Vorenus points out that anyone with a brain will be wondering where a Centurion with a measly salary managed to come about such a fortune and tells Pullo to give the money back to Caesar before his men come calling. This ends up saving Pullo's life from possible execution since Caesar is so happy to have deprived Pompey Magnus of any funds for his war effort that he rewards Pullo instead of punishing him for thievery.

Jane agrees but then points out that <em>this</em> diner is the only one which could afford to put a fancy sign on the highway to attract more customers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ozark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ozark">Ozark</a></em>:
<ul><li> Marty tells another character that it doesn't matter how much money you get illegally, if you can't launder it all you have is a lifetime of gas and groceries (because buying cars/houses/boats/etc. would raise too many red flags).
</li><li> Therapist Sue uses her knowledge of Marty and Helen's illegal activities to blackmail them, Marty warning Sue to be careful about spending. Imagine his reaction when this 60ish woman living in a small Missouri town shows up at Marty and Helen's house in a bright yellow Lamborghini.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Narcos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Narcos">Narcos</a></em>: One of the ways the DEA are able to track the cartel's movements is by finding the cars worth six figures in the slums of Medellin, at least until the Narcos wise up and start using more appropriate transportation. This is a problem for the Medellin cartel in general; despite owning many legitimate businesses for laundering purposes, their cash flow is so immense that they end up burying a ton of it because they don't know what else to do with it.

<ul><li> Bosch's partner J. Edgar comes under some suspicion since he dresses in expensive suits and has a nice car. However, he has a real estate side job that nets him much more than his police salary; it's implied that the only reason he remains on the force is that cops are more comfortable buying a house from a fellow cop, bringing him a constant stream of business.
</li><li> Bosch himself has very nice home in the hills overlooking the valley, well above a cop's price range. However, it's well know in-universe that he purchased the house with a large payout he got when a Hollywood studio made a film based on one of his cases.

Tracy agrees that is suspicious, but far from conclusive.
<ul><li> Tracy himself wasn't immune to this either, having been investigated during the forties for how exactly he could afford all his fancy gadgets, his spacious house, his top-of-the-line car, etc. on a cop's pay (answer: in addition to being abnormally thrifty, many of the electronics and cars were provided free of charge by his friend Diet Smith as "test" models.)

<div class="indent"><strong>Max Payne:</strong> The garage was dead. B.B. showed up in his tailor-made suit, gold watch, and cufflinks to match. All way beyond a cop's pay. <br/><strong>B.B.:</strong> Maxey... <br/><strong>Max Payne:</strong> Oozing suave charm, he was guilty as hell.
</div><ul><li> Fortunately, Max can be forgiven for not noticing B.B. was corrupt before: he never interacted with him, except via phone.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the missions for the Italian Mafia in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII">Grand Theft Auto III</a></em> is a slightly atypical example of this trope. A bartender working for a made man is suspected of leaking information to the Columbian Cartel, who have been showing a remarkable amount of foreknowledge of Mafia movements. The bartender is a suspect because he is spending more than the Mafia is paying him, and because he is not pimping women or selling drugs, which would account for the discrepancy.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> sets in when you wonder how the Don knew he wasn't doing either of those things: the Mafia probably would have taxed him if they found out he was making money in such a fashion, which could be an incentive to keep his mouth shut about it. Although it would have been a problem in its own way, untaxed criminal activity probably would have explained the extra money. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The point is partially moot. He was indeed selling out his bosses. He was, however, paid in drugs, which would not have accounted for the extra money unless he was selling them secretly.</span>

The implication (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">later proved to be true, if the player has him arrested rather than killed</span>) is that he is imposing outrageous fines on the city folk in order to bankroll his spending, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">including a large home for himself and his family for when he retires.</span>

</li><li> In "The Canine Mutiny," Bart uses the credit card he got in the dog's name (it makes sense in context) to buy a lot of expensive stuff, which makes Lisa suspicious.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder10');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder10" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> A couple of Soviet moles in the U.S. government were caught this way. A lot more spies should have been caught this way but no one paid any attention to the fact they were spending more than they were legally earning. It was only after they were caught that someone finally looked at their finances. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldrich_Ames">Aldrich Ames<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was among the most notable of these moles to be flushed out, who lived a particularly extravagant lifestyle, which was only seen as suspicious in retrospect. Everybody believed him when he said his Colombian wife came from money when she didn't. For a guy with a $60,000 annual salary, Aldrich Ames was somehow able to afford tailor-made suits that not even his superiors could afford, a $540,000 house in Arlington, Virginia, paid for in cash; a $50,000 Jaguar luxury car; home remodeling and redecoration costs of $99,000; monthly phone bills exceeding $6,000 (mostly calls by Ames' wife to her family in Colombia); and premium credit cards whose minimum monthly payment exceeded his monthly salary.
</li><li> A standard police investigative technique used when a seriously large theft of money is accomplished, usually in an armored car or bank robbery: keep eyes open on the street and see if all of a sudden someone is making unusually large purchases and take a look at them.
<ul><li> A variation in the case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InheritanceMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InheritanceMurder">inheritance murders</a>, where even if it's known that the person has come into a large sum of money, it raises cops' eyebrows that their first instinct is to spend lavishly rather than mourn their loved one. While it might not be strange to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetailTherapy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetailTherapy">spend money as a coping mechanism after losing somebody close to you</a>, spending it on new houses, luxury cars, and fancy outfits is going to raise the eyebrows of the cops.
</li></ul></li><li> In one case, a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/01/18/Police-find-change-theft-ring-suspect-tries-to-pay-bail-with-coins/3420030866385/">Rhode Island man<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was arrested under suspicion of breaking into vending machines to steal money from them. It definitely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHelpingYourCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHelpingYourCase">didn't help his case</a> when he made bail using nothing but quarters.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlCapone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlCapone">Al Capone</a>'s downfall is the stuff of legends. While the government couldn't prove that the millions of dollars he spent on entertainment alone (far more than he earned in his official job as a hotelier) every year was earned illegally, they could prove that he hadn't paid taxes on it.
</li><li> During the Prohibition era, the police and the bootleggers were public enemies but secret partners, and the police would casually look the other way on speakeasies and gin-mills for a small fee. Many of them were fired when they were seen buying diamond rings and expensive furs.
</li><li> In late December 1992, 9-year old <a class="urllink" href="https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Beers_kidnapping">Katie Beers<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> disappeared. Police were suspicious of the story told by the last person to see her, a family friend who claimed to have lost track of her at an arcade and so had him followed. As it turned out, they were correct—the man was holding the girl <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunkerWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunkerWoman">prisoner in his basement</a> and growing increasingly frustrated as he needed supplies but didn't dare to buy anything lest the cops see this and instantly take him in for questioning or arrest him.
</li><li> Many U.S. banks and creditors will suspect something is up if their customer suddenly starts making large purchases when they normally don't do so and/or at places that they've never been—ex: a person from New York suddenly spending money in Arizona, etc. The institutions will either freeze/decline the purchase or call the customer to confirm that it is them authorizing the purchase and not an unauthorized party that got into their account. Most banks will suggest that you call them before making a larger than normal purchase so they can authorize it when you make the purchase. Banks may also require additional paperwork if one is withdrawing or depositing a large amount of money to ensure that the money is not being used for illegal means. For the same reason, it's also recommended you call them in advance if you're going to be traveling overseas and using your credit or debit card on your trip.
</li><li> In 2013, the NCAA investigated college basketball player Shabazz Muhammad after he was seen wearing an expensive Gucci backpack (Shabazz had already been suspended previously for receiving benefits not allowed under NCAA rules). He was eventually cleared when it was proven that the backpack was a gift from family members.
