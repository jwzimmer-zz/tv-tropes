</div></div><p>When two or more law enforcement organizations both can lay claim on a particular criminal case or suspect they will rarely see eye-to-eye on the best way to prosecute/investigate the case. In the US, local cops vs. the Federal government (FBI, DEA, etc) is the most common setup. Usually, the locals will want to shut down a petty crook to protect their town and the "little guy," while the Feds are focused on the big picture and would rather he go free so they can focus on building a case against the "big fish" higher up the criminal ladder. When a case is particularly sensitive or difficult, the friction may be reversed: each group of investigators wants to absolve themselves of jurisdiction to avoid the problems that will come with it. This is most likely to happen if one of the groups is under pressure to improve their conviction rate and does not want to risk taking on a case they cannot solve.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Jurisdiction Friction may also occur at the initial crime scene: the hero investigator will barely have the time to unearth a few clues before the rival investigation outfit shows up to flash <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCopBadges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCopBadges">badges</a> all over the place and claim jurisdiction. At this point, the hero will either turn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan">Vigilante Man</a> or move on to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingTheSameCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingTheSameCase">a new case that's oddly reminiscent of the old one</a>.
</p><p>Which side of the dispute is sympathetic and which is heartless/incompetent/arrogant/corrupt/trigger happy/working for the shadow government depends entirely on who the main characters are. FBI agent series such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WithoutATrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WithoutATrace">Without a Trace</a></em> naturally will have them in the right, while a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceProcedural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceProcedural">Police Procedural</a> like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> is frequently on the other side.
</p><p>In addition to local versus Feds, the friction can occur between other law enforcement subdivisions over the same suspect, like drug enforcement officers versus homicide investigators, or simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry">one of a city's police districts</a> versus another. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalAffairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalAffairs">Internal Affairs</a> can also get involved at some point.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>, the commander of the UN Navy Pacific Fleet at first refuses to let Captain Misato Katsuragi of the special UN agency NERV command the operation to destroy an attacking angel, as he said the ocean is the Navy's domain.
</li><li> Happens in the anime version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>, of all places: as the third season <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> comes from outside the Solar System, the Outer Senshi declare that Sailor Moon and the Inners should stay out of their way, as in the Silver Millennium they were the ones dealing with enemies from outside. The Outers' method of dispatching youma are akin to Black Ops/ Wetwork operatives. Of course, the Outer Senshi are the only ones who care about prior areas of authority.
</li><li> Inspector Zenigata has been on the trail of Arséne <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIII">Lupin III</a> for years in hopes of hauling the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingOfThieves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingOfThieves">Master Thief</a> to Japan to face justice which he believes he finally has succeeded in when Lupin is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LupinIIITheItalianAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LupinIIITheItalianAdventure">arrested in Italy</a>... until he's told by the local authorities to buzz off. In this case, it's less due to a jurisdiction issue since Zenigata's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterpolSpecialAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterpolSpecialAgent">Interpol Special Agent</a> but a political issue - Lupin has a death sentence in Japan and Italy refuses to extradite suspects to countries on charges if it's likely they'll be executed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> has some examples of this despite the wartime setting thanks to the personal ambitions of Zeon's ruling Zabi family and their loyalists. After Ramba Ral loses his Gouf in battle with the Gundam, he puts in a request for a brand-new Dom to replace it. The request goes to M'Quve, who ultimately denies the request<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0fcpb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0fcpb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0fcpb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">More specifically, he lies and tells Ramba that the transport ship with the Doms was shot down in orbit</span> because he doesn't want Dozle Zabi (for whom Ral works) finding out about the secret mining operation that Kycilia (M'Quve's boss) has going in Oddessa, which leads to Ral performing an unsuccessful suicide attack against White Base and robs Zeon of another veteran pilot and leader.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em>, this plays a big part in how the balance of power in the United Kingdom goes.
<ul><li> Officially, there are three major branches: the British Royal Family, the Anglican Church, and the Knights of England. On paper, the Royal Family leads the country (and by extension, the parliamentary government as well as the police and other related agencies), the knights maintain the order (by way of ensuring the royal family and the church don't get too powerful as well as dealing with internal affairs the "normal" police can't handle), and the church deals with foreign affairs that cannot be concluded normally due to cultural differences (mainly the magic side affairs around the world and dealings with the science side, particularly Academy City). The friction is especially evident between the Knights (who normally side with the Royal Family) and the Church (who can exert the most pressure on the Royal Family).
</li><li> However, because the UK also consists of four separate cultures with their own desires (England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland), it's not uncommon for members of the same faction to hate each other or those of different factions to ally with each other based on where they side culturally.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Walker and Pilgrim in the comic book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Powers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Powers">Powers</a></em> often find their investigations turned over to the Feds. Naturally, this never stops them investigating anyway.
</li><li> A police ally of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a> once used this to save them when crooks-turned-feds Freedom Force attempt to arrest the mutant heroes. She insisted Freedom Force produce the documentation necessary to take the X-Men into custody (which they didn't have on them). This gave the X-Men time to flee the city.
</li><li> The military equivalent showed up in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a> when The Shield (an Army <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a>) and Magog (Marine corporal turned emissary of one of the Old Gods) ended up on the same mission together. They spent just as much time sniping at each other's respective branches as they did fighting the main threat.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> Year 100</em> Gotham City PD and the Federal Investigators clash over a murder, GCPD thinks it should have jurisdiction as the murder happened in Gotham, the Feds because it was one of their men <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and also because they committed the murder and are organizing a massive cover up</span>. Batman knows he has jurisdiction because <em>he's the</em> <em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Goddamn Batman</a></strong></em> (see <em>The Dark Knight</em> film below).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GothamCentral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GothamCentral">Gotham Central</a></em>, tension exists between the Major Crimes Unit and the other squads. Some of the conflict is because the other squads tend to use the fact that the MCU has jurisdiction over cases with supervillains to lazily dump routine investigations on them by claiming that the case bears the hallmarks of a supervillain. The rest of the conflict comes from the fact that the MCU is the only consistently honest department in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadCopIncompetentCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadCopIncompetentCop">notoriously corrupt and incompetent GCPD</a>.
</li><li> <em>Adventures in the Rifle Brigade</em> has a jurisdiction conflict between the <em>Wehrmacht</em> and <em>Gestapo</em>. See, the crack commandos of the Rifle Brigade were caught on the streets of Berlin by Panzer ace Otto Flaschmann, who happened to be there on leave. However, Gestapo captain Venkschaft claims them as his prisoners, since Berlin is his home court. Seeing it as his collar, Flaschmann pulls strings with some powerful friends of his to get them turned over to him and sent to a cushy POW camp (instead of being tortured, interrogated, and executed). A furious Venkschaft accuses him of hunting for headlines. It's a moot point; they escape from custody almost immediately after being turned over to Flaschmann.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a>:</em> As in the show (see Western Animation), in disasters Chief Wiggum and Mayor Quimby will argue over who's in charge, starting with the first issue.
<ul><li> When Krusty starts his own country, Krustopia, Springfield's police camp outside the compound and then proceed to do nothing. After a few weeks, federal agents show up and point out how useless the police have been. They take over, cut the power... and then join the police in sitting around.

The FBI agents agree to let the local authorities handle the situation temporarily, but then later take over.

Homicides committed on Indian Reservations are FBI jurisdiction, which often leads to conflict between the Navajo detectives and the FBI agents.

Meg and the Caerphilly County police chief manage to convince them to give Clay County to give the case to them by insinuating that the cost of the investigation will be astronomical, though Clay County still insists on having one of their people on the case as an observer, who turns out to be an interfering idiot. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The twist in this case is that he's not simply an interfering idiot, he also happens to be the murderer.</span>

</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElleryQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElleryQueen">Ellery Queen</a>'s novel <em>The Glass Village</em>, jurisdiction friction is the main point of the story.

To avoid a lynching, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the stranger is tried by the local townsfolk with the assistance of a judge who deliberately does everything incorrectly so that the verdict will be overturned on appeal and he can have a fair trial after tensions have eased.</span>

</li><li> The fourth <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RiversOfLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RiversOfLondon">Rivers of London</a></em> book, "Broken Homes", puts a spin on this. Peter states that unlike in television, friction occurs when other branches or services <em>won't</em> take over a murder or unusual case. Turns out murder investigations are really complicated, generate a huge amount of paperwork, use up all of the manpower budget <em>and</em> forensics budget, and are generally a pain in the arse all around (and that is just the mundane ones). Most Chief Inspectors are desperate to get that sort of headache off their budget.
</li><li> Happens in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSnowQueenSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSnowQueenSeries">The Snow Queen Series</a>. On the planet Tiamat, only off-worlders are subject to the star-spanning Hegemony's legal system; any Tiamatans caught in crime must be turned over to the Snow Queen's justice. Unless it's a crime that would affect her or her plans, Queen Arienrhod usually simply releases the perpetrators. Thus, criminal enterprises on the planet generally need only use a Tiamatan front man or front woman to avoid prosecution. This is an endless source of frustration to Hegemonic Police Commander Jerusha PalaThion and her force.

Later, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the New Rangers' Deputies arrogate authority, and the police don't like it. The heroes reveal themselves to the police commissioner precisely because they are sure this will cause the police to support them as soon as they get evidence.</span>
</li><li> In the thriller <em>Maxwell's Train</em>', a group of terrorists hijacks a train out of New York City. They managed to bring it over the border into Canada to attach it to another hijacked train in Toronto. The book openly notes how the common citizen would assume that "after so many hours, the combined forces of American and Canadian authorities would have stopped this." In reality, the terrorist leader knew the clashing of the FBI, state police, railroad officials and even the CIA would cause a massive amount of red tape to slow things down. Bringing the train to Canada just increased that as the Canadian authorities were totally unaware of this hijacking in the first place so had no idea this linking of trains would happen. The terrorist leader herself notes how this entire friction was key to her whole plan working.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JoePickett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JoePickett">Joe Pickett</a></em> novels, Joe—a game warden—frequently clashes with the local sheriff over jurisdictional issues. And matters get worse when other agencies get involved. <em>Winterkill</em> features a jurisdictional nightmare involving not only Joe and the sheriff, but the state police, the FBI, the Forestry Service, and the National Parks Service.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCrownerJohnMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCrownerJohnMysteries">The Crowner John Mysteries</a></em> (set in medieval Exeter), there is constant tension between the coroner Sir John de Wolfe and his brother-in-law the Sheriff over who actually has jurisdiction over a particular crime. It gets worse when the crime involves the Church, and so might fall under the jurisdiction of the Ecclesiastical Court.
</li><li> In <em>The Golem's Eye</em> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBartimaeusTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBartimaeusTrilogy">The Bartimaeus Trilogy</a></em>, Internal Affairs under John Mandrake (Nathaniel) is given leave to investigate and put to stop both the golem affair and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">the Resistance</a>, but the police chief Henry Duvall takes every opportunity he can to push for more power for his department and to try to make Internal Affairs look bad so that he can gain power over the cases. Oh, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Duvall is one of the masterminds of the golem plot.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallerAndSmallerCircles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallerAndSmallerCircles">Smaller &amp; Smaller Circles</a></em>, the Quezon City police, in addition to being generally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless">useless</a> at their work, can be very territorial, especially against higher authorities like the National Bureau of Investigation.

It doesn't help that they have very different methods (as far as the DTI are concerned, uptime groups like the 31st century's Time Agency are breaking the Temporal Prime Directive by even showing up in the 24th century) and that the uptime organisations aren't even sure they all come from the same future, and that one agency's "maintaining the true timeline" isn't another's "recklessly altering history".
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReginasSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReginasSong">Reginas Song</a></em>. One of the Seattle Slasher killings is on a Navy base, so the police aren't allowed on the scene. However, while this looks like it might be a problem, the Navy send everything they find to the police, and their autopsy leads to a major break in the case.
</li><li> <em>Crossfire</em>, the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShiraCalpurnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShiraCalpurnia">Shira Calpurnia</a></em> novel, illustrates how complex law enforcement can be in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> universe. Shira is a senior member of the Adeptus Arbites who survives an assassination attempt by a cybernetically enhanced psyker shortly after her arrival on Hydraphur. She immediately starts an investigation. However, the attack took place at the beginning of a lengthy vigil leading up to a major religious festival, with various strictures enforced by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">Battle Sisters</a> attached to the local cathedral that she must abide by or receive dispensations from. The Imperial Navy jealously protects its perogatives in the highly fortified system when Shira's investigation leads off-planet. In addition, the year's Master of the Vigil is throwing his weight around and the Inquisition takes an interest in the psyker. The Monocrat, Hydraphur's civilian governor, is the only major authority <em>not</em> seen openly intervening in the case.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Timeline191" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Timeline191">Timeline-191</a>, this is the reason reluctant rebel Scipio flees from South Carolina to Georgia after the Marxist uprising is crushed. Because the Confederacy places heavy emphasis on state's rights, there is less cooperation between the Confederate states in law enforcement matters. Georgia is too busy tracking down its own black Marxists to worry about fugitives from another state, so any warrants from South Carolina don't carry a lot of weight, and Anne Colleton (his former boss and primary pursuer) doesn't have as many social contacts in Georgia with whom she can pull strings to expedite the issue.

</li><li> You won't find many Starfleet officers who actually like (or even know about) Section 31, and most 31 operatives regard Starfleet as idealistic dreamers with no idea of how the universe truly works. Yet both are sanctioned forces of the Federation.

Given that the Obsidian Order is an extremely powerful entity in Cardassia, which is basically fascist, it's inevitable that they and the military will come into serious conflict on a regular basis. Really, any time a secret police force exists in Star Trek, you can expect it to come into conflict with the military at some point, probably quite a lot.

It's one of the writers' favorite ways to disrupt a case that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle">could be a slam dunk by the 45-minute mark.</a> It helps that New York's unique position in geography and politics — specifically, New York being America's largest city means that Feds are often brought in, while three other states (Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania) are very nearby — means it has a lot of overlapping government spheres of influence, second only perhaps to Washington, D.C.
</li><li> In only the first season, for example, one of three Federal inmates in a prison van is murdered during transport to court in Manhattan, leading to NYPD detectives and FBI agents bickering over who has the jurisdiction to question the other two prisoners while the deceased is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">lying dead on the pavement</a>. It then gets averted when the investigation leads them to Ian O'Connell, an accused killer with ties to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles">the IRA</a>. A British agent observing the subsequent trial not only cedes authority to Ben Stone, he offers to have a character witness from the UK fly to New York on the next Concorde to rebut the defendant's testimony. As he says to Stone, "O'Connell belongs in jail. Your jail, our jail, it doesn't matter."
</li><li> Two episodes ("Jurisdiction" and "Bronx Cheer") both dealt with overlapping jurisdictions where the Manhattan DA prosecuted one person and another jurisdiction prosecuted (or convicted) someone else for the same crime. Both times, the people the other jurisdiction prosecuted were actually innocent and had been railroaded for political reasons.
</li><li> This works to the good guy's advantage in one episode where Stone is forced to cut a very cushy plea deal to get testimony out of a member of the Russian Mafia which gives him immunity for any crimes he admits to in Manhattan. As soon as the mobster is off the stand, the police and D.A. of <em>Brooklyn</em> show up and arrest him, since his testimony implicates him for crimes in another jurisdiction which Stone smugly points out he has no control over.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Attorney:</strong> We had a deal! No prosecution in New York City.
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Stone:</strong> In New York <em>County</em>  that's Manhattan. I never gave your client immunity in Brooklyn; that's <em>Kings</em> County. <em>[To the client]</em> If you want some free advice, sir, next time get a better lawyer.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em>:
<ul><li> In most cases, it's actually a reverse of the standard version. One law enforcement jurisdiction will often try to foist murder cases onto another to avoid having their numbers go down when the case inevitably goes unsolved. The city police actually go <em>to</em> the FBI, begging for their assistance in busting criminals or solving crimes, but the Feds usually turn them down due to their new, mandated focus on terrorism.
</li><li> In Season 2, the Baltimore <em>City</em> police, the Baltimore <em>County</em> police, the Port Police, and the Coast Guard all fight <em>not</em> to take a huge murder case, as they know there's no chance of solving it and will damage their clearance rates (ratio of homicides solved to homicides reported). Jimmy McNulty—a City cop—eventually sabotages City's attempt not to be saddled with the murders because he wants to get revenge at City Homicide's bosses for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">exiling him to the Harbor Division</a>.
</li><li> Valchek brings the FBI into the investigation of his nemesis Frank Sobotka, which is welcome news to the police unit, but it also means they'll have to re-prioritize their targets. The feds ultimately withdraw their support when union corruption charges are made, since the feds were only interested in international racketeering.
</li><li> When Frank Sobotka's son Ziggy gets arrested for murder, Ziggy gets arrested, taken to Homicide, and processed by Jay Landsman. But Landsman forgets to bring the Sobotka detail in the loop about this important arrest, meaning that the Greeks are able to clear out their operation before the police can serve warrants on them, including Glekas' store. Understandably, Daniels is very pissed.
<div class="indent"><strong>Daniels:</strong> Let me ask you, who exactly am I working all these dead girls for? The Homicide unit, right?

</div></li><li> Season 5 features a straight version: the FBI expressed a willingness to take on the <em>massive</em> drug/murder investigation of Marlo Stanfield, but only if the Baltimore State's Attorney (the local prosecutor) would hand over the prosecution of corrupt State Senator Clay Davis to the United States Attorney (the federal prosecutor). Everyone knows that a federal case would be much more likely to get a conviction, because the jury pool would include the suburbs in Baltimore and Anne Arundel Counties, and possibly even rural areas even further out (where jurors would either not know Davis or regard him as a corrupt City politician long overdue for a commuppeance), while a state trial would draw only from the City of Baltimore (where Davis had his base of support and could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtroomAntics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtroomAntics">grandstand</a> as a defender of Black interests—never mind that the State's Attorney was himself Black). However, the State's Attorney shuts down this deal, because he wants to take Davis down personally so he can run for Mayor after Carcetti runs for Governor. Sure enough, the City jury acquits Davis after he engages in just the kind of grandstanding everyone predicted, and the State's Attorney is left a laughingstock of Baltimore politics.

<ul><li> Subverted when the clearly-more-competent FBI comes to town to investigate a serial killer and the local crew try desperately (and fail) to (in the words of Lt. Dangle) "not seem like dicks" to them.
</li><li> Played for laughs on another occasion where the Reno sheriffs' drug sting operation (posing as a buyer) nets-a DEA sting operation (posing as the seller), after both go through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongList" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongList">Long List</a> of humorous drug euphemisms.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em>:
<ul><li> Dr. Huang (an FBI profiler) often acted as a mediator between the squad and the feds. One gets the feeling during the times he actually takes the FBI's side, he does so not because he thinks they're right, but because he doesn't particularly like <strike>Stabler</strike> most of the SVU team.
</li><li> Another episode featured Benson and Stabler going up against the FBI when one of the key participants in their case was revealed to be in the Federal Witness Protection Program as a witness to a key Federal case. Subverted, in that Benson and Stabler's interference in the Federal case merely ended up getting the guy killed and screwing up both the FBI and NYPD investigations.
</li><li> On another episode, Internal Affairs shows up to ream Stabler and Huang after a suspect commits suicide in custody. Since Huang is FBI, everyone in the scene is perfectly well aware IA can't touch him. The IA guy starts blustering ineffectually "And you — Dr. Huang — you better watch yourself too!" Huang proceeds to openly roll his eyes and scoff at the guy in one of the greatest "bitch, please" moments in the series.
</li><li> They also occasionally clash with detectives from other departments. In "Countdown", while searching for an 8-year-old who's been kidnapped and has only three days before she's murdered, they discover that the perpetrator is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> with victims from all over the city. The detectives who handled the case of the Brooklyn girl outright refuse to cooperate because of the underhanded way Benson and Stabler got their files until the latter pair remind them that yet another little girl is going to die if they don't help.
</li><li> At the end of one episode then-Captain Cragen lampshades that this trope actually helps criminals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">get away with their actions far too often because they can actually cooperate</a> while the several police departments <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether">have to be convinced to work together</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Largely averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em>: the FBI main cast won't get involved in a case until the local authorities ask for help since they don't want the locals to stop asking. This was a minor problem in one episode until an agent notices that a letter from the UnSub was sent from a different state, giving the FBI jurisdiction anyway.
<ul><li> It was a major issue in one episode, where Reid and Prentiss are sent into a cult compound to investigate allegations of pedophilia, posing as social workers (since the FBI isn't welcomed by cultists). Before they sent agents in, the FBI checked to make sure that no other law enforcement organizations were planning operations that could interfere, receiving negative answers from police at all levels. In fact the state AG had been planning a major raid by the state police and lied about it, since he didn't want the FBI co-opting his big operation (which was essentially a publicity stunt for a gubernatorial run next year), and went ahead with it while Reid and Prentiss were still inside, sending the cultists into a siege and endangering the agent's lives. When Hotch takes command of the situation he essentially bans the state authorities from the scene in retribution, relying solely on the county sheriffs.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> bristles when it comes to the NID, but it all gets really simple once <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they turn out to be the Bad Guys anyway</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em>, the titular <em>forensic technicians</em> have apparently unlimited authority to interrogate suspects, pursue fugitives, engage in gun battles, make arrests, and cut deals. In the real world, their obviously massive share of departmental funding alone would make the normal cops psychotically jealous — but the eager and justifiable use of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfConservationOfDetail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfConservationOfDetail">Law of Conservation of Detail</a> makes many a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">Fan Dumb</a> believe that in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIVerse">CSI Verse</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless">normal cops are useless</a>. Also, it seems that CSI also have ridiculous authority to investigate crimes and incidents that clearly would fall under Federal Jurisdiction (The bus accident in <em>CSI</em>, and the plane crash in <em>CSI: Miami</em> being prime examples which would fall under National Transportation Safety Board, a federal agency). The first season had at least one episode where the CSIs clashed with the FBI.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY">CSI NY</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mac butting heads with the U.N. over a French diplomat who died during a New York party. Mac wanted to move the body for an autopsy but got refused for a while.
</li><li> Mac flashing his badge in Chicago to get into the Tribune building didnt amuse Chicago P.D., who quickly reminded him he had no jurisdiction.
</li><li> However, it does mimic the original at times, such with the case involving blood on the Statue of Liberty. That would be investigated by National Parks police in real life since its a national monument. There was also a case with a dead Marine that would clearly have been NCIS territory in real life.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych">Psych</a></em>:
<ul><li> Parodied when the Treasury Department horns in on a case. Naturally, they have their own <em>Federal</em> psychic consultant.
</li><li> When Chief Vick (police) and her sister (Coast Guard) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingRivalry">get in a fight</a> over which of them has jurisdiction over a case. Vick's sister even hired Shawn and Gus and <em>sidelined them</em> just so Vick wouldn't have their service.
</li></ul></li><li> Comes up frequently in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em>. Is the dead body of the week a matter for NCIS, their counterparts in the Army, the FBI, or a local enforcement agency? Sometimes, characters on all sides get so snappy about jurisdiction that it seems they're more interested in having cases on their records than catching the bad guys... and the main characters are not above playing some dirty tricks in order to keep control of an investigation, such as when they agree to hand over a corpse to the FBI but put one of their own (live) agents in the body bag instead.
<ul><li> The pilot episode both played it straight and subverted it. First, a Navy Commander dies on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AirForceOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AirForceOne">Air Force One</a>, and the case is fought over by NCIS, FBI, and the Secret Service. Then a Marine Major dies in identical circumstances and the local police have no problems handing the case over, 'cause they've got another body across town to deal with.
</li><li> A couple of episodes later, the NCIS team manage to basically seize a crime scene from the local cop after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">browbeating him over his slipshod approach to crime scene investigation</a> (which included handling evidence with his bare hands, allowing reporters onto the scene, and presuming that the victim was a drug dealer without evidence). A few miles away, meanwhile, there are a couple of dead drug dealers at a crime scene controlled by Army CID, who happily turns it over to NCIS and the DEA because the two crime scenes seem related, and because the local CID office is shorthanded that day.
</li><li> Gibbs has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">frontierish</a> eye-for-an-eye attitude toward justice that in some ways resembles that of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePatriarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePatriarch">clan chief</a> more then that of a cop. The cases he demands are often those in which he vaguely feels he has some reason to think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">It's Personal</a>.
</li><li> Averted in another episode of <em>NCIS</em>; the local cop offers to cooperate fully, in exchange for all credit.
</li><li> Played with in an episode where the case is under clear FBI jurisdiction and NCIS is called in only as a courtesy since the main suspect is a spy NCIS once arrested. When the NCIS team starts investigating, FBI agent Fornell makes a big stink about NCIS interfering in his case. He is then told that the NCIS and FBI directors talked about the issue and the FBI director used his discretion to transfer the case to NCIS jurisdiction. It is then revealed that Fornell was pulling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> on NCIS. He did not want the case so he made a big stink about jurisdiction specifically so that the NCIS team would go above his head and take the case from him. However, in the end, the joke is on him since the directors decide that the FBI should be represented in the investigation and Fornell is assigned back to it.
</li><li> Sometimes it goes well, though; Team Gibbs has a comfortable working relationship with CGIS Agent Abigail Borin, who shows up on a fairly regular basis when NCIS and the Coast Guard both have an interest in the same case.
</li><li> Gibbs in particular has an <em>excellent</em> relationship with Army CID Colonel Hollis Mann — so good they begin dating each other in fairly short order, and stay together for nearly a year — though that doesn't stop them from bickering over jurisdiction when their cases overlap. It's fairly clear that one of the reasons Gibbs is so into her is that she can go toe-to-toe with him on equal terms.
<div class="indent"><strong>Hollis</strong>: If this is going to turn into a pissing match, you'd better bring an umbrella.
</div></li></ul></li><li> Mostly ignored on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISLosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISLosAngeles">NCIS: Los Angeles</a></em> as the LAPD usually isn't informed of what's happening. Did show up in an episode where each group was conducting an undercover op into the same people, which caused enough of a problem that the team gained an LAPD detective as a liaison and member of the team. <em>Los Angeles</em> also tends to give this a nod whenever the team has to do something that would require going through local channels, but don't have the time — Hettie goes a long way back with a lot of people and can easily procure the warrants needed to veto the usual chain of command. This gets played for laughs at one point where the local cops hand over a case with absolutely no hesitation. The team thinks this is suspicious... then notice the dead guy kept a meticulous filing system <em>without</em> a computer.
<ul><li> A major case is when Callen and Mosley work with the ATF tracking some weapons dealers. Mosley, naturally, tries to assume command only to be told by the ATF that this is their case. It gets dramatic when an ATF undercover agent is killed when one of the gang members recognizes him. Mosley wants to charge in but the ATF agent insists they keep to the plan so the agent's sacrifice won't be for nothing. When the arms dealer is about to escape, Mosley demands Callen arrest him with the ATF head telling her they need to let him go in order to track his clients. When Mosley demands again, the ATF operative snaps that she will arrest Mosley on the spot if she opens her mouth and lets the man go. While Mosley rants about this, she's put in her place that this was an ATF operation and Mosley nearly ruined it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISNewOrleans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISNewOrleans">NCIS: New Orleans</a></em> is currently featuring a <em>lot</em> of friction between the FBI and the NCIS branch in NOLA.

Disgruntled, the cop leaves, but one of the agents corners him and explains off-the-record that they're <em>already</em> investigating the case; official policy is not to let on to the locals, hence their apparent lack of interest. Satisfied, the cop agrees not to let on that he talked to them.
</li><li> Played variously on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em>. Considering that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentMulder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentMulder">Agent Mulder</a> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> for a conspiracy believing weirdo, understandably some local cops are annoyed when he shows up spouting his nonsense.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em>:
<ul><li> The FBI shows up in a Season Two episode, and there's a little Jurisdiction Friction but they ultimately wind up helping more than getting in the way (although <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they still need Castle's insight to actually get the case solved</span>), and the FBI agents in question are nice people. Most of what tension there is seems to stem primarily from the fact that Beckett is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UST">seething with jealousy</a> (not that she admits it) about Castle's fascination with the gadgets the FBI bring with them and the way he clicks with the lead FBI profiler.
</li><li> "Setup"/"Countdown," when the Department of Homeland Security pulls rank once the case involves possible radiation and foreign terrorism. The DHS agent in charge, while a hard-ass, is actually a reasonable guy; the fact that Castle <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">had a private meeting with a member of a foreign government's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice">Secret Police</a></span> is a valid reason to be furious.
</li><li> Comes up again in "Lynchpin." There's Jurisdiction Friction but Castle and Beckett are on the <em>other</em> side of it as they're working with the CIA and required to keep secrets from their colleagues at the NYPD.
</li><li> Once again comes up in "The Human Factor". An American dissident is killed by a military drone missile and the Feds completely block the NYPD's attempts at investigation at an apparent attempt at coverup. Once Beckett gets her hands on the Special Investigator from the Attorney General's office, however, and extracts a promise of help from the Attorney General himself, they get along better.
</li><li> Played straight in the Sixth season ep "Need to Know", only with Beckett now working for a Federal task-force taking the case away from Castle and the NYPD. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In order to help her colleagues with the NYPD, Beckett goes against her Federal partner McCord and provides the press with an anonymous tip.

<ul><li> Some serious jurisdiction friction crops up "You're Gonna Miss Me When I'm Gone" when the NSA decides a murder has national security implications. Although the NSA has no authority to investigate homicides, they seize all of the evidence they claim has security implications and refuse to grant the BPD team access to it.

However, Don Eppes did clash with a narcotics detective in the episode "Man Hunt", and with the NSA in the episode "Finders Keepers."
</li><li> Although the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sanctuary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sanctuary">Sanctuary</a></em> team has no real jurisdiction, this trope comes into play a few times as they try to gather abnormal-related evidence before the law enforcement comes in and sets up jurisdiction.
</li><li> Played straight and parodied on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse">Dollhouse</a></em>. FBI Agent Ballard gets stonewalled by an ATF Agent after the latter completely botches a high-risk warrant on a religious cult (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">Does This Remind You of Anything?</a>?). Later, several of the Dolls and their human handlers are sent to investigate an outbreak, but the handlers are only given cover identities as private security. Topher, as a joke, programs the Dolls to think they are NSA Agents, who act like jurisdiction-stripping jackasses to their handlers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheShield">The Shield</a></em>: Played for serious drama, as Vic manipulates the LAPD and ICE against each other in an effort to get a job offer and an immunity deal from the latter.

</li><li> Talia Winters and Susan Ivanova argued on what to do with a teenage thief who just awakened with Telepathic abilities; Talia wanted the teenager to join the Psicorps, and Susan wanted to have her go through the justice system. Dr. Stephen Franklin intervened, saying that since the teenager is unconscious, she is in medical care, and both of them should leave as they could be disturbing the patient.
</li><li> When the war criminal known as Deathwalker turns up on Babylon 5, just about every member race of the League of Non-Aligned Worlds sends a warship that demands that she be turned over or else they would attack the station. Ivanova defuses the situation by getting them to argue with each other over <em>which one</em> of the threatening warships Deathwalker should be turned over to, as there was only one of her. Also, the major powers want her immortality drug or want to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreacheryCoverUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreacheryCoverUp">avoid a trial</a>. Sinclair negotiates a truce that allows the development of the immortality drug, and a trial. Deathwalker reveals that the drug requires a death for a life. Then Kosh asserts his jurisdictional claim as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">a Vorlon</a> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> kills Deathwalker</span>.
</li><li> When a bomb goes off in one of the fighter bays soon before the President of the Earth Alliance is expected to arrive on Babylon 5, a detachment of his security detail arrives to try and take control of the situation. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief">Garibaldi</a> is accused of being behind the bombing, and ends up going into hiding while he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearMyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearMyName">tries to find out what is going on</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> Michael Westen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice">Burn Notice</a></em> made use of this trope one time, walking into a torched building and claiming to be from the county government. He didn't get free access to the site, but it bought him a few minutes while the city fire chief called the county office.
</li><li> The second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter">Dexter</a></em> has a variation. When Dexter's victims are discovered, an FBI taskforce is sent to assist Miami Metro, because the task force leader (Special Agent Lundy) is an expert at difficult serial killer cases. This trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">defied</a> by Captain Matthews, who insists that the case will not be a "jurisdictional circle-jerk." Lundy joins his task force with the Homicide team and generally works well and respectfully with them. When another killer starts copycatting Dexter, Lundy warns that the FBI may seize total control of the investigation; Dexter ends up killing the copycat, so that he won't be locked out of the loop.
<ul><li> Happens again (briefly) in the Third Season: A series of murders are blamed on a local drug dealer that killed the kid brother of a Crusading ADA and a high-ranking Miami-Dade Sheriff's Deputy. (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dexter actually killed both the dealer and the brother, the latter by accident.</span>) When a body is found matching the killer's MO but outside Miami's metro area, the Deputy uses this to shoehorn his way into Miami PD and take over the investigation.
</li><li> The fourth season has the FBI take control of the investigation into the Trinity Killer. The Homicide team is especially bitter about this, since they had not only done pretty much all of the legwork by then, but the FBI had been ignoring Lundy's insistence that the killings were connected for 15 years.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist">The Mentalist</a></em>, the CBI often finds itself bumping up against local police departments who are not happy about them having jurisdiction.
<ul><li> A finger of a missing (later revealed to be murdered) man from Nevada was found in the desert and a team of experts was needed to establish which side of the California-Nevada border the spot where the finger was found was in. If it was in Nevada, the CBI would have no jurisdiction. If in California, they'd be allowed to work on the investigations. Considering who the protagonists of the show are, it's obvious which state the finger was found in.
</li><li> In the fifth season premiere "The Crimson Ticket," the F.B.I. and C.B.I. agents have a throwdown regarding the events of the previous season's finale.
</li><li> Subverted in another episode in which the titular mentalist actually expresses hope that they could just pass the buck on a missing persons case involving a rich-and-well-connected type he's not interested in investigating to the F.B.I.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jane</strong>: Can't we just give it to the F.B.I.? They love that stuff.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Lisbon</strong>: Oh, I wish. Boss is doing on-cameras - it's our baby.

This means that one of President Bartlet's last official acts in office turns out to be calling both governors at the same time, picking one at random, and basically telling him not to be such a damn idiot and send his state's National Guard out anyway, since no one cares who's job it is to rescue the train as long as <em>someone</em> does it.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewTricks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewTricks">New Tricks</a></em> the team occasionally experiences this when a cold case they are investigating turns out to be connected to an active case. They are not supposed to be investing active cases since most of them are not actually police officers any more.

<div class="indent"><strong>Jack</strong>: Jack McMannus, state crime division. <br/><strong>Don</strong>: What? Like the Feds? <br/><strong>Jack</strong>: No. Feds are federal. I'm with the state. See, it's Feds, <em>[gestures up high]</em> state, <em>[gestures slightly lower]</em> you. <em>[gestures way down low]</em> <br/><em>[later]</em> <br/><strong>Tommy</strong>: Hey, who's this guy? <br/><strong>Jack</strong>: Jack McMannus, with the state. <br/><strong>Harry</strong>: Ooh, a Fed! <em>[gestures up high]</em>
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alcatraz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alcatraz">Alcatraz</a></em>: Since Alcatraz was a federal prison, Hauser's federal taskforce should have jurisdiction over capturing the returning "63s". However, since the government's been keeping a tight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade">Masquerade</a> on the disappearance and return of the inmates, and the crimes committed by the 63s so far have fallen under SFPD jurisdiction, there's been a lot of headbutting between the groups. Fortunately, since Rebecca's a cop, she's able to handle the cases without stepping on toes.
<ul><li> Episode 4 has Hauser intentionally invoking this trope as a delaying tactic — the villain of the week has taken hostages in a bank, and the police have arrived to deal with it. Hauser plays the role of traditional FBI agent in these situations in order to distract the cops long enough for Rebecca to sneak in and extract the target.
<div class="indent">"I'm going to go join that jurisdictional pissing match over there and buy you some time."

This fades in later episodes to the point where the writers seem to forget that Sarah and Casey work for two different agencies, though it could just be argued that Sarah and Casey had transitioned from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork">Teeth-Clenched Teamwork</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends">Fire-Forged Friends</a> in that time.

In "The Radio Job", they get barricaded by FBI inside a building, so they fake a terrorist threat and turn the situation into a turf war between the Feds and Homeland Security. While the two team leaders are butting heads, they buy themselves times and escape through a series of distractions.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>, Lannister soldiers claiming the king's authority come to arrest Gendry, who has joined the Night's Watch. Yoren asserts that recruits of the Night's Watch are immune from arrest, but the Lannister men refuse to back down, resulting in a fight.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks">Twin Peaks</a></em>:
<ul><li> The events surrounding the murder of Laura Palmer crossed the county line, thus necessitating the presence of FBI agent Dale Cooper. When he arrives in Twin Peaks, he tells Sheriff Truman that he's encountered this trope in past dealings with local law (see above under <strong>Film</strong> for an instance of his colleague dealing with it) and hopes to avoid any friction here. In pleasant defiance of the trope, Truman completely agrees and the two quickly become friends, with one exception: when Cooper advises Truman, on scant evidence, to release Ben Horne and drop the charge of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Laura Palmer's murder</span>, Truman, for the first time, refuses point blank, declaring he's "had enough of the mumbo jumbo" involved in Cooper's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheExoticDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheExoticDetective">eccentric approach to law enforcement</a>.

The DEA agent turns out to be an entirely reasonable cop who ends up helping Cooper to prove his innocence.

Gordon Cole recounts that he instructed them to "open their hearts or die".
</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em> had the Roswell Sheriff refuse to release a mysterious body to the FBI. For good reason.

</div></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Southland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Southland">Southland</a></em> sees two LAPD officers, one of them Jessica Tang, argue with a pair of LA County officers over who takes responsibility for cleaning up a guy hit by a train, with his remains spread from the track (County jurisdiction) to the road. However, when Tang tongue-lashes someone down the phone over getting help for a homeless retired Marine, the County officers quickly agree to take the body.
</li><li> This is a recurring problem on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Longmire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Longmire">Longmire</a></em>. Longmire has no jurisdiction on the Native reserve and is openly despised by the tribal police because he got their old police chief arrested for corruption. In turn both police forces hate getting the feds involved if they can avoid it. Longmire also gets into trouble when an investigation leads into the neighboring county and that county's sheriff is not happy that Longmire did not notify him.
</li><li> The rivalry between the Metropolitan Police and the City Police causes problems in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RipperStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RipperStreet">Ripper Street</a></em> episode "The King Came Calling".

</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ATouchOfFrost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ATouchOfFrost">A Touch of Frost</a></em> has David Jason's Inspector Frost (Britain's answer to Columbo) seeking to investigate a suspected murder on an Army base. Frost is hindered and frustrated by the Royal Military Police (who at the time of screening were following the old principle of demarcation between British civilian and military authorities: if a serious crime happened on a military base, it was for the RMP to investigate and no business of the civilian cops, whose remit ends at the barracks gates). Frost sees how amateurish and incompetent the Army cops are at investigating murder, and gets involved anyway: as he uncovers skullduggery, financial corruption, bullying, illegal sale of military equipment, et c, the Army cops eventually realise they're all on the same team. Eventually.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SupernaturalS09E02DevilMayCare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SupernaturalS09E02DevilMayCare">"Devil May Care" (S09, Ep02)</a>, Kevin blackmails a Navy officer to persuade her to allow Sam and Dean, who are posing as FBI agents, to investigate a crime on the Navy base where the FBI would not have jurisdiction.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em>:
<ul><li> "Mr. Monk Gets Jury Duty", involved an actual dispute over jurisdiction: the San Francisco Police Department captures Top Ten Most Wanted fugitive Miguel Escobar and charged with him with a local homicide case. But the FBI and the DEA want to try Escobar first because he's wanted for drug trafficking charges in multiple states. Stottlemeyer is reluctant until the FBI agent who passes him word of the transfer of custody produces a warrant from the U.S. attorney general.
</li><li> Whenever the Feds get involved in an SFPD homicide case, what usually happens is that the Feds and SFPD have very tense cooperation, and in the end, Monk and the SFPD end up invariably closing the case and embarrassing the feds.
<ul><li> "Mr. Monk and the Sleeping Suspect" has a mailbombing case which is handled by the ATF (who technically <em>do</em> have jurisdiction as crimes involving the postal service are federal offenses). Stottlemeyer does show contempt for Special Agent Josh Grooms, the agent in charge.
</li><li> "Mr. Monk Meets the Godfather" does this with the investigation into the quintuple homicide of some mobsters in a barbershop, and the mob family they worked for was under investigation by a joint ATF-FBI task force. When boss Salvatore Lucarelli recruits Monk to look for the man responsible for the shooting, Monk finds himself getting involved with the FBI who want him to go undercover to recover evidence implicating them in other crimes, which Stottlemeyer is against as the Lucarelli family killed and dismembered the last guy who tried to infiltrate the family.
</li><li> "Mr. Monk Gets Cabin Fever" has Monk get put in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitnessProtection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitnessProtection">Witness Protection</a>, under Agent Grooms's custody. Stottlemeyer and Natalie also are brought along, with Stottlemeyer only coming because he doesn't trust Grooms with Monk's safety. (Note that the witness protection program in the US is actually handled by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/USMarshal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/USMarshal">US Marshals</a> service, not by the FBI).
</li><li> "Mr. Monk and the Really, Really Dead Guy" had jurisdiction friction over a particularly gruesome homicide involving a street musician who was killed six ways (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">struck over the head, suffocated with a plastic bag, poisoned, stabbed four times, shot two times, and run over with a car</a>, in that order). In that one, the Mayor has called in the Feds, and Stottlemeyer doesn't like this, nor the fact that the FBI guys treat Monk with contempt. (In reality, the FBI wouldn't have jurisdiction over this case, unless the victim was a political figure, someone in the witness protection program, the homicide was committed during a crime that is a federal offense (like a security guard being killed during a bank robbery) or the killer crossed state lines in committing the crime. The entire case should have been handled by the SFPD only.)
</li></ul></li><li> There is evidence that the Feds and SFPD sometimes get along: in "Mr. Monk Is Someone Else", there's smooth cooperation between Team Monk and the FBI Los Angeles field office. In "Mr. Monk Bumps His Head", Randy persuades the FBI to lend the SFPD a plane when Monk is found with amnesia in Wyoming. And in "Mr. Monk and the Election," when evidence shows up at the crime scene that the shooter used an AK-47, Stottlemeyer tells Randy to call the ATF and request their help (though the ATF doesn't show up onscreen, it is mentioned that the two forces are working together on the investigation: the SFPD to look for the suspect, and the ATF to locate the gun).

They refuse to give the Hawkins police access to even see the body close up, and even have the local coroner sent home so someone "from state" can perform the autopsy. Hopper finds this all to be very suspicious, combined with the fact that the body looks way too intact for someone who supposedly fell into water from a high cliff, and suspects there's some sort of cover-up going on. To prove his theory, he strikes up a conversation with O'Bannon, the trooper who called it in. O'Bannon claims the quarry was state-owned, and Hopper agrees, only for him to then immediately reveal the quarry is actually privately owned, so O'Bannon would have no business being there, and makes O'Bannon quickly fess up. Hopper then goes to the morgue, and tries to bluff his way past the state trooper assigned to guard the door, but quickly catches on that it's one of the conspirators in costume, there to make sure no one gets close enough to find out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that the body is actually a fake mannequin stuffed with cotton</span>:

<ul><li> An intriguing version in that the friction comes within the <em>same</em> agency. The FBI Homicide division is investigating the murder of a psychic. Agent Kay finds a suspect is under investigation by the Counter Intelligence division, checking in with him. He tells her it's just a routine investigation into money launderers. Later, he saves Kay and Cameron from a hitman and reveals that the suspect is a major arms dealer and they didn't want Homicide messing up their case. Cameron lampshades on how he somehow always assumed the FBI was on the same side and they both give him a "don't be ridiculous" look.
</li><li> A later episode has Kay's ex-boyfriend, a CIA operative, involved in the chase for a thief. When the thief is captured, she escapes into the building. The agent is forced to admit that she's heading for a secret CIA black ops site that the FBI didn't even know was in the same building for some information on a past case. Kay notes how the CIA's refusal to share information with other agencies just causes a lot of problems.

The new FBI negotiator immediately tries to throw her weight around, and proves to be far more incompetent than Horst Cali in dealing with the situation (although some of the things that happen are beyond her control, such as an independent sniper trying to kill one of the hostage takers), leading to him reassuming control of negotations.

<ul><li> The third season sees some of this going on between the NYPD and the FBI, since the FBI are in Wilson Fisk's pocket and corrupt, and the NYPD are not. Foggy is quick to note that Fisk's "deal" only applies to his federal case, and that he can still be prosecuted for his crimes at state level irregardless of the outcome of his federal case. District Attorney Blake Tower is reluctant to pursue a case against Fisk, citing jurisdictional matters. Foggy sees this as Tower not wanting to jeopardize his reelection chances, though Tower could have other motives (like not wanting Fisk to get a chance to expose some of Tower's own complicity in Reyes' activities).
</li><li> In "Karen," Fisk sends Dex to kill Karen as revenge for her murder of James Wesley. As he fails to kill Karen, only succeeding at killing Father Lantom, Dex is forced to return after changing into his FBI windbreaker to smoke out Karen and Matt, who are hiding in the basement, as the NYPD are conducting their investigation. Matt eventually gets an idea as to get Karen out of the church alive. He has Foggy show up to the church, and announce loudly that Karen will only surrender to the NYPD. There's a bit of back and forth between Brett Mahoney and Dex, with Ray Nadeem defusing the tension by quietly warning Brett about Dex's treachery. So Brett "arrests" Karen and escorts her and Foggy out of the church, puts them in the back of a squad car, and drives them to a point a few blocks away where they then reconvene with Matt.

The friction usually comes into play when somebody on any one of these sides turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop">Dirty Cop</a> working with the criminals (with the others either unaware or <em>knowing</em> but unable to touch them due to the fact they haven't done anything necessarily illegal yet and been caught), or when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Raylan Givens</a> is getting on everyone's nerves with his actions violating procedures even if for a good cause.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EarthFinalConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EarthFinalConflict">Earth: Final Conflict</a></em>, this can happen whenever a Companion Protector shows up at a crime scene or at a place of interest and starts to pull rank on the local police. In one case, an American cop clashes with the Protector to the UK Companion, who points out that Companion Protectors have worldwide jurisdiction. In some cases, Protectors keep their rank and authority from their previous job, like Agent Ronald Sandoval still being in the FBI, even though his primary loyalty is now to the Taelons, not the United States.

The livestock agents are loyal to the Duttons, the Broken Rock tribal police are loyal to Rainwater, and the sheriff's office serves any interest the sheriff finds expedient. Asserting jurisdiction over a case means that someone gets control over it. In the pilot episode, livestock agents and tribal police nearly get into a shootout over a jurisdictional dispute involving a fortune of stolen Yellowstone cattle.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions">Champions</a></em> universe the two U.S. government anti-supervillain agencies PRIMUS and SAT have been known to squabble over who's in charge of investigating or dealing with supercrimes. Likewise, conservative elements in the U.S government resented the way UNTIL charged around the U.S. and created SAT specifically so the U.S. could handle its own super-problems.
</li><li> The fantasy world of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a> Banestorm</em> has an unusual take on this with the city of Tredroy, which is part of a Sunni caliphate, a Shi'ite sultanate, and a Christian principality simultaneously. Intersectional disputes between the three different legal systems have to be very carefully negotiated.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em>.
<ul><li> Used to great effect by the shadowrunners. The very basis of the setting's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega-Corp</a> system is that corporations of a certain size are granted extraterritoriality over their possessions, with private security to enforce corporate laws which may or may not match up with the local government's version. A sufficiently daring shadowrunner can commit a run in a government area and escape into a corporate zone, or vice versa, where the opposing police force cannot pursue him. Tensions between public and corporate police forces are high enough that extradition is rarely an issue; between opposing corporations, even more so. Just be careful not to get caught: Private security tends not to be overly concerned with such trivialities like the Geneva Convention, and the poor unlucky runner might find himself the recipient of some creative product testing rather than a nice safe prison term.
</li><li> <em>The Neo-Anarchist's Guide to North America</em>. In Washington D.C. there's considerable conflict over jurisdiction between the FedPol (Federal Police) and the FDC (Federal District of Columbia) National Guard.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines">Space Marine</a> chapters in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> universe can be notorious for this. The Space Wolves and Dark Angels chapters, rivals for the past 10,000 years, have actually fought wars with each other over jurisdictional grievances.
<ul><li> This is cranked up yet another notch when the Inquisition gets involved. Members of the Inquisition technically only answer to each other and the Emperor, and can call upon the aid of any Imperial citizen, from a janitor to a High Lord of Terra. However, fleet units, planetary governors and armies of the Imperial Guard sometimes take exception to the Inquisitor's edicts and have enough political clout and firepower to make an Inquisitor's day miserable. Space Marine chapters technically don't answer to the Inquisition and can tell an Inquisitor to piss off, but doing this is inviting an Inquisitorial proceeding as to <em>why</em>, and Inquisitors have enough personal and institutional power that even large chapters are leery about doing so without <em>very</em> compelling reasons. This is cranked up <strong>ANOTHER</strong> notch when two Inquisitors start butting heads.
</li><li> It gets better (well, worse): The Inquisition is divided into several orders, with the chief ones being the Ordo Xenos (deals with aliens), Ordo Hereticus (deals with heretics), and the Ordo Malleus (deals with daemons). Each faction tends to look down on the others as getting in the way of dealing with the major threat or not doing enough against it, of using unsanctioned weapons, of being at greater risk of corruption by the enemy...
</li><li> One of the main divides in the Inquisition are the Puritans and Radicals: The Puritans are those who mostly use faith and tried-and-tested methods against Chaos, the Radicals are willing to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">Dangerous Forbidden Techniques</a>, possessed weapons and daemonhosts to use Chaos against itself at the risk of falling to Chaos themselves (curiously, most Radicals are in fact older Inquisitors who feel traditional methods aren't doing enough).
</li><li> Some systems also have their own branches of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePoliticalOfficer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePoliticalOfficer">Commissariat</a> in charge of the local Planetary Defense Forces. The friction happens when the Imperial Guard has to defend those systems because the local commissars tend to punish IG members, which is overstepping their bounds as far as commissars in the main branch are concerned. The local commissars have a tendency to get shot by the members of the main Commissariat.
</li><li> It gets more interesting on the law front, as the Ecclesiarchy has its own courts which are wholly independent of civil law; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Adeptus</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd">Arbites</a> have jurisdiction over all Imperial crimes (plus general law enforcement on some worlds directly administered by the Imperium rather than local governor), and only have to defer to the Inquisition, so there have been numerous occasions when they have clashed with the Ecclesiastical courts, or even the Commissariat (on at least one occasion, the Arbites have arrested an entire Imperial Navy task force, and on another, commandeered a cruiser in the middle of a contested warzone to provide the muscle to arrest an Imperial Planetary Governor). To make matters even more fun, the Adeptus Mechanicus has its own laws and enforcers, and its members technically aren't even Imperial citizens, but members of a (semi-subordinate) allied (semi-)sovereign polity, meaning trying to pin a crime on them is really tricky. Oh, and the exact set of laws that apply in any situation depend upon whose territory it is.
</li><li> And the worst is this is all entirely deliberate: the last time a single man controlled every branch of Imperial power, it led to the Age of Apostasy.

Various law-enforcement agencies are told to simply look the other way whenever Spectres arrive on the scene, much to their annoyance.
<ul><li> Noveria is <em>not</em> legally in Council Space, and while Spectres (by agreement) are allowed to go armed and investigate there, any attempt to assert their authority will be buried in paperwork.

</li><li> Asari Justicars are fully committed to upholding an ancient and strict Code that allows for no leniency. Asari law enforcement is obligated to stand aside if one shows up but gets very worried as there's a good chance that anyone involved in a crime, no matter how small, will end up dead very soon, which tends to be a diplomatic nightmare when the person in question is anything other than another asari. On Ilium, meanwhile, the local authorities have to arrest a justicar who's on a mission to enforce off-world laws, while the justicar is obligated to fight her way free after one day.

The agent in charge doesn't endear himself to the CPD detectives working the case, mostly because he's rather evasive about certain relevant information, but settle their differences and come to a working agreement. Then things take a turn for the weird... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">What the FBI are really investigating is some kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> black-project <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">Gone Horribly Wrong</a>, and the suspect really <em>is</em> a werewolf.</span>

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse">Whateley Universe</a></em> story "Loose Cannons", a five-way battle took place between the M-SOC (Metahuman Special Operations Command), the MCO (Mutant Commission Office), some unnamed jerks in power armor, the KoP (Knights Of Purity), and some superpowered teenagers. The M-SOC, the MCO and the KoP were "arguing" jurisdiction over arresting the teenagers.
<ul><li> Also gets lampshaded a few times regarding superhero teams and their relations with each other, local police, and federal authorities. For example, in Los Angeles, the superteams have an agreement that they won't jump into a fight (which they weren't already immediately present for, that is) until the authorities request them to get involved, and that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupermanStaysOutOfGotham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupermanStaysOutOfGotham">don't poach other teams' fights</a> unless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GondorCallsForAid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GondorCallsForAid">the other team asks for help</a>. This leads to an amusing scene in "Silent Nacht" where the members of one superhero team watch live footage of a rival team getting trounced while munching popcorn and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST">critiquing the other team's performance</a>.

In the end, neither of them does anything about the monorail because they're too busy reading the town charter to see who really <em>is</em> in charge of the situation (and getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy">distracted when Wiggum notices he's entitled to "comely lasses"</a>).
</li><li> Subverted in the later episode, "The Bob Next Door", where Sideshow Bob's plan to murder Bart without legal consequences involves the murder taking place in "Five Corners", the point where five US states meet (he would stand in one state, shoot the gun in the second, the bullet would pass through the third, hit Bart in the fourth, and he would die in the fifth, Bob reasoning that no single act is against any law in any state). Chief Wiggum arrives to arrest him at the last minute, so Bob steps into another state where the Springfield PD has no jurisdiction. It's then revealed that Wiggum contacted the police of the other four states, and each is waiting in their respective jurisdictions, and amicably work together to bring him in.

<ul><li> In "Sidetracked", Perry has to work with agent Lyla Lollibery of COWCA (The Canadian Organization Without a Cool Acronym) to stop one of Doof's schemes on a train that runs along the border between the United States and Canada, due to the fact that each organization only has jurisdiction on one side of the train.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder11');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder11" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Real-life example: The Waco Siege in 1993, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) tried to raid a compound, and made a complete mess of things. The FBI steps in, takes over, brings in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness">a friggin tank</a>, and makes an even BIGGER mess of things. The two agencies have been at odds ever since.
<ul><li> Still the situation in 2009.<a class="urllink" href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1932091,00.html">[1]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> This article details, among other things, the ATF and FBI arguing over who should investigate explosions on a routine basis.
</li></ul></li><li> Considering the multiple law enforcement agencies and the occasional shift of control (control of the drug unit is shifted from department X to department Y), this is certainly a reality in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheUnitedStates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheUnitedStates">The United States</a>, between the ATF, DHS, DOJ, FBI, CIA and more.
</li><li> Margaret Garner, when cornered by slave catchers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled">killed her children rather than let slavers take them back with her</a>. This produced a legal discussion as to whether the Federal Fugitive Slave Act trumped mere state murder charges. It did, so she had to flee.
<ul><li> However, in Toni Morrison's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beloved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beloved">Beloved</a></em>, which was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory">Very Loosely Based on a True Story</a>, Sethe is put in a state jail immediately, frustrating the slave catchers.
</li></ul></li><li> In countries that have a gendarmerie (regular soldiers trained as cops who enforce the law among the civilian population) there is often a rivalry between the gendarmerie and the local police.
<ul><li> Particularly bad in Italy, where there are EIGHT different police forces. Things are regulated this way:
<ul><li> If it happens in a fire (especially if the fire <em>is</em> the crime), the <em>Corpo Nazionale dei Vigili del Fuoco</em> (the <em>firefighters</em>) have jurisdiction.
</li><li> The <em>Carabinieri</em> (gendarmerie and military police) have jurisdiction if the perpetrator is a member of the armed forces or the crime involves organized crime, terrorism (they have an anti-terrorism branch for this), crimes at sea, crimes against the environment or happening in national parks and forests (these were actually under the jurisdiction of the State Forestry Corps, but it was completely absorbed by the <em>Carabinieri</em> in 2017), drugs or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">food sophistication</a></em>, or there's just need for serious firepower (they're part of the armed forces, after all, their standard equipment includes assault rifles and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">squad automatic weapons</a></em>, and if things go south they also have larger machine guns and sniper rifles).
</li><li> The <em>Polizia di Stato</em> has jurisdiction over crimes happening in cities and those involving highways (there's a special branch for this), railways (another special branch), mails and internet (a third special branch), airways (special branch), organized crime (special branch), drugs (special branch), and preventing any kind of crime (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">another special branch</a>).
</li><li> The <em>Guardia di Finanza</em> has jurisdiction on financial, tax, terrorism and drug-related crimes, doubles as custom guards and military police, and may intervene when there's need of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">larger firepower than the</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Carabinieri</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">can muster</a> (after all, the <em>Carabinieri</em> don't have grenade launchers and hand grenades, while the <em>Guardia di Finanza</em> does).
</li><li> The <em>Guardia Costiera</em> has jurisdiction on crimes at sea, assuming the State Police, the <em>Guardia di Finanza</em>, the <em>Carabinieri</em> or the <em>Italian Navy</em> don't get there first (Italy has a <em>lot</em> of coastlines, and the Coast Guard needs any help they can get).
</li><li> The <em>Polizia Penitenziaria</em> deals with crimes happening in jails and escorts convicts whenever they are to get out of the prison before their sentence expires (if they need to go to the hospital or to testify).
</li><li> <em>Polizia Provinciale</em> and <em>Polizia Municipale</em> deal with minor crimes happening in towns and provinces; minor crimes in general are dealt with by whoever gets there first.
</li><li> Finally, since 2008, <em>Italian Army soldiers</em> can double as police officers if they happen on a crime or are needed for crowd control, at least until other police forces arrive and take over. They also regularly patrol certain areas of major cities such as Milan and Rome
</li></ul></li><li> To mitigate the problem, efforts against drugs and organized crime (that are jurisdiction of the <em>Carabinieri</em> and the <em>Polizia di Stato</em> and tend to involve also the <em>Guardia di Finanza</em>) are coordinated by the <em>Direzione Centrale per i Servizi Antidroga</em> (Central Directorate for Anti-Drugs Services) and the <em>Direzione Investigativa Antimafia</em> (Anti-Mafia Investigation Directorate) respectively.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Ramirez">Richard Ramirez<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (also known as the Night Stalker) avoided capture because of exactly this.
</li><li> In British Policing (at least, say 90% of the time), whether this is any uncertainty whatsoever, the bickering will be over why one's own force shouldn't be responsible for an investigation. This shouldn't be complicated because jurisdiction in Great Britain is very simple on paper — the force which polices the area where the crime happened investigates — but it never works that way in practice. Where there are no cross-border issues, it becomes a question of which squad or team within the individual force gets lumbered with the responsibility — and then it gets ugly.
<ul><li> The exception to this is any incident involving armed forces personnel, because they're subject to military law and are supposed to be handed over to the military police... unless civilians were involved, in which case it gets complicated. For example, the submarine HMS <em>Astute</em> was paying a goodwill visit to the city of Southampton when one of the posted sentries suffered some sort of mental breakdown (as it turned out, he had been on a 48-hour drinking binge and had had over 20 pints of cider and beer, plus other drinks) and opened fire in the control room, killing one officer and wounding another. The perpetrator and his victims were all Royal Navy personnel, but the ship was in a civilian port rather than a Royal Dockyard and when the shooting occurred, several members of the city council were in the compartment whilst being given a tour of the non-classified areas. Figuring out whose jurisdiction <em>that</em> falls under will probably take much longer than the actual trial.
<ul><li> In fact, it took less time than feared since Ryan Donovan, the shooter, was convicted in 2011, the same year as the crime, to life by a civilian court, the option of a military trial being also available.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> This trope is a fact of life in countries with a federal political system, including Canada and the United States. Different levels of government are continually squabbling over who has jurisdiction in any given sphere, arguing over money and agitating against perceived "unfair" treatment from each other. In some cases, this is deliberately encouraged — one reason the United States chose a federal system dividing power between the federal and state governments was to prevent either one from becoming too much of a threat to individual liberty.
<ul><li> Canada initially started with a stronger federal government after seeing how American federalism was a factor in the Civil War, but a series of well-argued court cases in the 19th and 20th centuries gradually transferred more powers to the provinces at the federal government's expense.
<p></p><ul><li> Health care remains a sticking point, as although it's a provincial responsibility, most of the funding comes from the federal government due to its more extensive taxation powers, giving them a great deal of leverage for enforcing its conditions on the provinces. This naturally leads to frequent complaints of federal interference in provincial affairs.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> A strange subversion of this exists in the West Bank/Palestinian Territory, as Israeli citizens (regardless of race or religion) fall under Israeli law, while the Palestinians who are not citizens are under martial law, especially in zones B and C. Things are kept so separate that if an Israeli soldier actually witnesses a citizen commit a crime against a Palestinian in the territory, that soldier cannot arrest the citizen but must call the police.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3brh6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3brh6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3brh6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Even if the soldier is inclined to do so, which is an arguable moot point. For a practical beither, neither the IDF nor the police cares about crimes committed against Palestinians.</span>
</li><li> The manhunt for John Dillinger in 1933-1934 was one of the earliest cases of friction between the FBI and local law enforcement. The FBI was a relatively new and untested agency that wasn't taken seriously by all, local officers disparagingly called the FBI agents "college boys".
<ul><li> After Dillinger broke his colleagues out of the Michigan City penitentiary in the fall of 1933, the Indiana State Police petitioned the FBI for help pursuing him but were rebuffed, leaving the ISP and Chicago Police Department to track Dillinger down.
</li><li> In November of 1933, they picked up his tail but a disagreement over whether to capture Dillinger by himself or with the rest of the gang led to a dramatic car chase allowing Dillinger to flee.
</li><li> In April of 1934, after Dillinger, his girlfriend Billie Frechette, and Homer Van Meter evaded an FBI raid in St. Paul that included officers from the notoriously corrupt local police, J. Edgar Hoover issued memos forbidding local police from participating in FBI raids.
</li><li> This came back to haunt the FBI later the same month at Little Bohemia Lodge, after they failed to notify local officials of a capture attempt on the Dillinger gang. Combined with them not spot-checking the entire area around the lodge, a firefight broke out, an innocent bystander was killed and his friends wounded when they were mistaken for associates by the FBI, and one agent was murdered and had his car stolen by Baby Face Nelson.
</li><li> Finally, In July, the agents had a tip on his whereabouts in Chicago and sparingly notified the local police agencies of their intention to make another arrest. This was fortunate, as the agents staking out Dillinger's suspected location were reported as potential robbers by a concerned citizen. A final shootout ensued and Dillinger was killed.
</li></ul></li><li> In the pursuit of another 1930s criminal, Alvin Karpis, both the FBI and the federal postal inspectors claimed jurisdiction, with the postal inspectors one step ahead of the FBI for most of 1935.
</li><li> Very sadly, "the Wall", a bureaucratic device designed, supposedly, to facilitate co-operation between the FBI and the CIA was largely responsible for the failure of US authorities to stop the 9/11 attacks. In (highly simplified) essence, the CIA was massively anal about secrecy and viewed telling the FBI anything as a security risk, and the FBI was massively anal about chain of evidence and viewed telling the CIA anything as compromising some future prosecution. Indeed, the FBI didn't even know the hijackers were in America until a few days before the attacks, and even then, this was only because a CIA officer accidentally copied an FBI agent into a round robin email. Trying to prevent this from happening again is why the Department of Homeland Security was created.
</li><li> Inside Washington, DC, what police department is responsible for a crime depends on location, time of day, the phase of the moon, and the condition of the president's dog. There is the DC police, there's the Secret Service, Capitol Police, FBI Police (really), Smithsonian police, National Cathedral police, various college police forces, and way too many Federal agencies trying to secure their own various headquarters...here's a handy <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_law_enforcement_agencies_in_the_District_of_Columbia">list of them all<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Just remember to keep away from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserSight">little red dots</a>.
<ul><li> Applies to the Washington DC metro area as a whole, with Virginia and Maryland surrounding and only a stone's throw away from the District of Columbia. Not to mention numerous local, state and federal facilities scattered throughout the neighboring counties.
</li></ul></li><li> Having two anti-virus softwares on your computer at once can cause a digital version of this. AV software tends to have to do things like read the contents of random files, monitor access to critical system files, and generally interpose itself between applications and the system, which is something that a lot of <em>viruses</em> do. As such, it's not too uncommon for them to label the other a virus, and attempt to delete each other.
<ul><li> This also counts as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb">Logic Bomb</a> in certain scenarios: One will intercept a data transfer to check it for potential threats, then send it on. The other will see this transfer, intercept it, and send it on. The other will see this transfer, intercept it, and send it on. The other will see this transfer, intercept it... This is why some Antiviruses try to detect if it's the sole antivirus on the system, and bitch about it if it isn't. Due to a misconception spread by some "computer experts" back in the 90s, there were a handful of users who were convinced that it's beneficial to have multiple antiviruses on the same machine. After all, two heads are better than one (except in this case).
</li></ul></li><li> A version of this can happen if you're trying to perform a given task on your computer (say, opening a PDF file) and you don't have a program assigned to perform said task by default. If that's the case, you'll have your computer asking you which of your capable programs you want to perform the task every time you want it done.
</li><li> Many of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Belgium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Belgium">Belgium</a>'s current issues stem from its French and Dutch/Flemish-speaking communities and public servants operating in silos, from the comical (the Fries Revolution and strip protests) to the tragic (security lapses with the 2016 Brussels bombings).
</li><li> Any society where the population is divided into several ca can fall victim to this trope.
<ul><li> During the Middle Ages, the jurisdiction depended on the personal status of the party and/or the place where the action took place. These jurisdictions were the feudal justice, Church justice, City justice, and the nascing Royal justice. For example, a cleric might expect to be tried in a Church court applying Canon law, a peasant might be tried by his lord while burghers might be tried by their city. Furthermore, there were matter-related jurisdictions, such as treason being tried by Royal justice while heresy and marriage-related cases being tried by Church ones.
</li><li> Until 1746, Scotland had <a class="urllink" href="http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095932563">heritable jurisdictions<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-hollywood-gets-wrong-about-being-an-fbi-agent-2016-7#myth-the-fbi-doesnt-play-well-with-others-1">This Business Insider article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> discredits the trope (in fact, referencing this very article to do so), saying that the <em>expectation</em> of the trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeImitatesArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeImitatesArt">actually causes it</a>, as local authorities may mistakenly think the FBI behave the way they've seen in film and television.
