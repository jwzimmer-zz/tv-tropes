This character would be nothing more than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">The Ditz</a>, except they have one area of expertise in which <em>no one</em> can beat them.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em>: Kouji Kabuto is mostly infamous by being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Idiot Hero</a> (mainly due to the anime series, since in the original manga he was more careful, more tactful, and believe it or not, less sexist). But unlike many similar hot-heads, he is actually exceptionally bright when he allows himself to think things through. This is demonstrated both in the Mazinger Z series, when at least twice he had to completely disable mechanical beasts with hostages inside (one of them being Sayaka's disabled cousin, Yuri); and in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UFORoboGrendizer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UFORoboGrendizer">UFO Robo Grendizer</a></em> series, where he builds his flying saucer all by himself and later develops the Cyclone Beam. He is also an excellent shot (demonstrated in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mazinkaiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mazinkaiser">Mazinkaiser vs. Ankoku Daishogun movie</a></em> when he shoots Archduke Gorgon in both his tiger head and human head with one shot). It should be noted that Koji is sent to America in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger">Great Mazinger</a></em> to study, so he can become a scientist since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kenzo, Koji's father</span> mentions that he has the scientist blood of the Kabuto family inside him. So, its pretty much hereditary.
</li><li> Shigeru from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds">7 Seeds</a></em>. (Talent: Eidetic Memory) His memory is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhotographicMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhotographicMemory">great</a>, he can tell Ango where he put the scissors after he last used them a week ago and it's not because he was paying attention, he just "noticed" it. But in everything else, Shigeru is pretty below-average. He lacks stamina, making it difficult for him to climb, he can't get a fire properly started without using something as a kindling, and is pretty slow, often looking up words in a dictionary when he couldn't remember them... until he decided to just <em>learn the entire dictionary by heart</em>. When Shigeru becomes serious, though, he <em>can</em> prove himself to be pretty competent in various situations, it's just that his self-confidence is not the best, either.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteClumsyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteClumsyGirl">Cute Clumsy Girl</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpaqueNerdGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpaqueNerdGlasses">Opaque Nerd Glasses</a> Mey-Rin</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em> may be a complete failure at almost everything she does, but not when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she's in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdSniper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdSniper">Cold Sniper</a> mode</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Muyo!</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mihoshi Kiramitsu from some of the various continuities. (Talent: Several, actually. Full eidetic memory, outrageous luck and the ability to get into places where she shouldn't — or <em>couldn't possibly</em> — be.) In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalVideoAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalVideoAnimation">OVA</a>, however, she tends more toward <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">Bunny-Ears Lawyer</a>. It's lightly implied in many of the continuities that Mihoshi used to be a genius cop, but she got so overstressed that she had a mental breakdown — thus becoming the way she is now and that the moments of hypercompetence are actually remnants of her former self. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> also has it that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she's the great-great-great-great granddaughter of Washu... As in the 8th-dimensional goddess, greatest scientist in the universe, Washu. Part of her ridiculous luck/genius moments/otherworldly skill is some fraction of that sort-of-divine spark emerging within her</span>.
</li><li> Seina Yamada, protagonist of the <em>Tenchi Muyo</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyoGXP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyoGXP">Tenchi Muyo! GXP</a>: Galaxy Police Transporter</em>, is purported to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">"blessed" with the worst luck in the universe</a>. His bad luck, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome">has a tendency to land him in a number of favorable circumstances and eventually lands him his own command with the Galaxy Police</a>. The reason for this being that he constantly automatically attracted looting or downright murderous space-pirates, across galactic distances, regardless how much they tried to avoid him. Since space is far too vast for the Galaxy Police to efficiently monitor, they finally had a way to round up the criminals, whereas Seina had so much "bad luck" that he actually started to spend it all. The bad luck also had a tendency to literally <em>bleed</em> onto other people. He isn't affected as much because he's used to it and, regardless of how bad his luck is, will only suffer injuries.
</li></ul></li><li> Yurika Misumaru from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico">Martian Successor Nadesico</a></em>. (Talent: Tactical/strategic genius.) However, she takes the "ditz" part to such an extreme that she really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">makes a great deal more tactical/strategic blunders than she does actually intelligent moves</a>.
</li><li> Shima Katase from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StellviaOfTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StellviaOfTheUniverse">Stellvia of the Universe</a></em>, directed and produced by the same people as <em>Nadesico</em>. (Talent: Genius programmer.) Granted, she is not as ditzy as Yurika...
</li><li> Mutsumi Otohime from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina">Love Hina</a></em> is a classic example. When studying for her exams, she aces the practice tests, but in the actual exam she fails because she forgot to write her name on the paper, or how she once fainted before the test started. She also notices things the other characters dont even pick up on, such as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When the girls go to rescue Keitaro the island they where on was on the other side of the international date line she was the only one who knew and thus Keitaros exam was sent back in time for him to make it in to Tokyo U at last</span>. She knew the others at the Hinata inn's names even though Keitaro and Naru didn't tell her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tama did.</span> But she conscientiously kept that on the down low at first. Mutsumi is the only one that could instantly tell Sus brother (cousin) was not the real Keitaro and vise versa, etc., etc. Mutsumi becomes somewhat less ditzy but continues to affect ditziness in order to keep people around her guessing. (Talents:Super attentiveness, genius levels of intelligence, sharp senses, good luck, calm and peaceful heart.)
</li><li> Minako Aino/Sailor Venus from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> is a Genius Ditz in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">most adaptations</a> (<em>main</em> talent: combat). She remembers more of her past life than any other Senshi, is skilled enough to fight demons with no training and no backup, and generally excels at anything she actually cares enough to try (and it's enough things to qualify her as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenaissanceMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenaissanceMan">Renaissance Woman</a>)... But she is also a lazy, naive teenager. This is all on top of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">stronger and faster</a> than the rest of her teammates without transforming, and often what leads her to save the day when their powers get blocked in some way.
</li><li> Most of the characters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicUsersClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicUsersClub">Magic User's Club</a></em> are Genius Ditzes of one type or another. The main character is useless at everything except her magic, which is superpowerful, and the white-haired girl is literally a complete ditz until she does magic, at which she's better than anyone else, except that she makes things spin when she affects them with magic.
</li><li> Ed from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em> is a genius hacker who otherwise has trouble even communicating in normal speech, and often seems prone to wander off chasing the most recent interesting thing that crossed her line of vision. In one episode it was revealed she is also good at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess">chess</a>, she is also quite dexterous.
</li><li> Yomiko and, to a greater degree, the Paper Sisters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ReadOrDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ReadOrDie">Read or Die</a></em> fall into this category, generally acting as lazy, incompetent, and clumsy bibliophile <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyFreeloaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyFreeloaders">Pretty Freeloaders</a>... that is, until it's time to sharpen their index cards and head out in their true capacities as paper-wielding super-spies.
</li><li> Ryuichi Sakuma from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gravitation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gravitation">Gravitation</a></em> in his spare time is a hyperactive, pun-loving kid adult who makes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Keet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Keet">Keet-like</a> Shuichi look subdued, but on stage proves why he became Japan's most famous singer. In the manga, though, he displays insight and quick thinking even when in "ditzy" mode, which makes him more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">Bunny-Ears Lawyer</a> in original canon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> Mashiro Kuna acts like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanChild">Womanchild</a> and dresses up like a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fangirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fangirl">fangirl</a>, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she can keep her Hollow mask on for <em>hours</em> outside of battle. And was a Vice-Captain in the Gotei 13 before she became a Visored</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> series:
<ul><li> Gourry Gabriev is a brilliantly talented swordsman who is otherwise about as sharp as a bag of wet sponges.

Gourry's problem is often implied to be some rather skewed priorities more than anything else (though he obviously has some memory issues, too): the two most important things to him are fighting and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">food</a>, and if it doesn't have to do with one or the other he isn't likely to remember it. Thus, he might forget the names of some of his closest friends and frequent traveling companions, but he knows right away Lina's lying when she tries to convince him that he promised to give her his prized Sword of Light and forgot about it because there's no way he'd promise that in the first place. He is also shown to be surprisingly perceptive; if you pay close attention, he's usually the first to notice when something is amiss. Hence, he picked up on Xellos' true nature early on but didn't say anything because he thought it was too obvious.

Part of this can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> taking into account that he grew up very far from civilization, with only his adoptive grandfather to raise him in the wilderness, and then he had to live by himself when his grandfather died. However, his brilliance is found in fighting, first and foremost. He learned how to fire his own Kamehameha wave simply by watching Muten Roshi do it (despite the fact it took Roshi fifty years to develop it), then not only took it as his signature move but created variations and enhancements of the move Roshi couldn't have possibly foreseen, proclaiming him to be a "genius". Also, learning the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">Kaio-ken</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinedEnergyAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinedEnergyAttack">Genki Dama</a> not only took him less than nine months to learn, but even though with the former he's not supposed to multiply it by even beyond twice, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">he found a way</a> to push it to times twenty, and the latter he found a way to gather energy from nearby planets and collect it. He even discovered the weaknesses behind his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Saiyan</a> form just by using it once, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">and find an effective way to use it</a>. Not to mention that he learned the After Image technique after seeing it only once and even tricked his master with it. He also used the Solar Flare successfully against its own creator after seeing it used only twice. He also so savvy in battle that he often outsmart fighters who are much more intelligent than him. Besides fighting, he also seems to be highly skilled at farming by the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, especially when it means getting his hands dirty rather than using tools and equipment.

The female lead has been (impatiently) coaching Gemma to be smarter than she acts, so when Gemma has a sudden brainwave as the heroes return to their yacht, the audience naturally expects some amazing insight that will find the treasure they have been searching for while confirming Gemma is more than just an airhead. Actually, Gemma has only just realized that the name of her father's ship ("The Precious Gem") is, get this, similar to <em>her</em> name.
</li><li> The 2008 movie version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GetSmart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GetSmart">Get Smart</a></em> casts Maxwell Smart as something like this: while he's notably clumsy and overconfident as a field agent, his abilities as an intelligence analyst are noted by many characters to be the finest in the agency.

</li><li> In the post-credits scene of <em>Women in Trouble</em>, Holly Rocket turns out to be pretty good at trigonometry. It's not a perfect example of this trope, since the question she answers is really just a pretty conventional high school math problem, but in the context, it works.

He's so dumb, in fact, that his efforts to cultivate a drug habit have resulted in him snorting baking soda, washing powder, powdered chalk, etc. and never knowing the difference. He doesn't even swear properly; he just drops an "-ing" three times in the average sentence, and it's not a euphemism for anything. Show the man a work of art, however, and you'll suddenly have a giant, slurry-mouthed, red-nostriled <em>expert</em> on your hands.
</li><li> Owlswick Jenkins in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakingMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakingMoney">Making Money</a></em> is clearly suffering from some sort of mental illness, including paranoid delusions of being followed by "Them", and so removed from reality that he can't even comprehend the illegality of forging government stamps.

</li><li> Leonard of Quirm shows flashes of this in his appearances. He's not so much "pure ditz" as he is absent-minded and unbelievably naïve, but he's also probably the most brilliant, and potentially dangerous, inventor on the Disc.

</li><li> Professor Sybill Trelawney is both this trope <em>and</em> its inverse: she is apparently utterly incompetent at Divination, her own field of study. However, on occasion, she is capable of oracular predictions about the future, which, due to happening in a trance, she knows nothing about, and refuses to believe in when she is told what it was that she predicted. While her normal predictions are about as reliable as a take-out Chinese restaurant's fortune cookies, anything she says in her trances <em>will</em> come true.

</li><li> Harry himself is borderline: he's no ditz, but is average at best in most of his studies and would be worse if he didn't have Hermione to cheat off of. He has two areas of expertise: flying (he was the only one in his class to successfully command a broomstick on his first try), and defense against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkArts">The Dark Arts</a>.

Lord Peter himself comes across as this, though that is explicitly stated to be a coping strategy for the post-traumatic stress he acquired in the Great War.
</li><li> The Hermit in <em>Literature/Hieroglypkics</em>. Despite being well-read, he forgets Machen's name 3 times in their first meeting; Machen says that he would repeat this "feat" many times throughout their acquaintance.
</li><li> Julia Larwood of Sarah Caudwell's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HilaryTamar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HilaryTamar">Hilary Tamar</a></em> mysteries is presented as a highly skilled tax barrister who, apart from regularly getting lost in the city she lives in, completely forgets to pay her own taxes.

Although a well-respected physician and natural philosopher, after having been at sea for nearly 20 years he can barely row a boat and still doesn't understand basic nautical terminology.
<ul><li> Jack Aubrey himself is an even better example. He is a highly skilled sailor and capable personal combatant. He has also become so good at the mathematics and astronomy needed to navigate he has come to the attention of the Royal Society, he builds his own telescopes, and is an accomplished violinist. He is also dreadful at languages, dispenses wisdom like "they have made their cake, and must now lie in it" and firmly believes the sons of Noah were named Cain, Abel and Moses.

Some of her public persona may have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a>, but she was still pretty ditzy.
</li><li> Paul Dekker, from C.J.Cherryh's <em>Heavy Time</em> and <em>Hellburner</em>, has basically no sense of time, routinely forgetting which year it is and vividly hallucinating past traumatic events. The other side of the coin is his ability to <em>hyperfocus</em> (concentrating very deeply, improving his reaction times), which allows him to fly space fighters moving at significant fractions of lightspeed.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ModestyBlaise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ModestyBlaise">Modesty Blaise</a></em> series, recurring character Dr Giles Pennyfeather is the male equivalent of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteClumsyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteClumsyGirl">Cute Clumsy Girl</a>, with no grace or style, no tact or ability at dissimulation.

While you can't call her <em>stupid</em>, she still comes across as a fragile pretty-face, who never could manage in the world on her own. But at least she's really good at playing the piano (which ironically seems to be the only thing that her otherwise super-competent cousin Beatrice <em>can't</em> do).
</li><li> Henry Branwell from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheInfernalDevices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheInfernalDevices">The Infernal Devices</a></em>. <em>Big time</em>—Henry is as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsentmindedProfessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsentmindedProfessor">absentminded</a> as they come, but when it comes to mechanical stuff, he's your guy.

Zolov suffers from Alzheimer's Disease and is stubbornly convinced that Gaia's name is Cindy (she's long since given up trying to convince him otherwise). He also beats her every time they play, which is an impressive feat, considering that Gaia's skill level is equivalent to that of an internationally-ranked Grand Master.

It's outfitted with an incredible grasp of engineering diagnostics, making it capable of running a remarkably detailed safety check on anything it's asked to fuel...but if told to walk in a straight line, it will dutifully march off a cliff (although, since a fusion reactor is a thing wise designers are careful with, it's probably durable enough to survive doing so).

Her insensitive comments often portray that she is actually a shrewd observer of human nature.

Nevertheless, almost every season ends with the pair being arrested and sent to jail. Ricky's also an expert when it comes to growing marijuana and converting it to hashish. He and Julian make an effective team when it comes to dealing drugs—Julian handles the business side of the operation, while Ricky grows and harvests the dope crop.

His son Nog (introduced as a petty thief with no respect for women or education) proves to have some of his uncle's business acumen, a knack for engineering, and in one potential future becomes a respected Starfleet captain. Most notably (although it also doubles as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">Characterization Marches On</a>), Rom is described early on as "an idiot" even by Constable Odo, who has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> level of attention to detail.

However, as his name implies, he is a great decoder...well, actually, sometimes he isn't even good at that. Sometimes he forgets where the period goes, for example (this is deliberately done so that the kids at home have a chance to figure it out themselves). Nevertheless, the rest of the characters always turn to him for all their decoding needs.
</li><li> Michael Scott, from the American version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">The Office</a></em> is childish, selfish, egotistical, deeply insecure and lonely, and an all around buffoon with no managerial skills whatsoever. He also demonstrates on occasion that he is a superb salesman who is roundly beloved by his clients, which is what got him promoted in the first place. (David Brent, his counterpart in the original UK series, lacks any such redeeming features). He also occasionally demonstrates a certain cunning streak, such as when he tricked Dwight (who had been gunning for his job) into thinking he had been promoted in order to tear it away from him in a manner which would ensure that he would never try such a thing again <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and when he bluffed David Wallace into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">buying out his worthless and bankrupt company by hiring back himself, Pam and Ryan</a></span>.

Or Hitler impersonated. He's scarily good at impersonating angry German officers of various calibers, despite his puppy-esque normal demeanor.
</li><li> The (radio) newsreader in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InTheRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InTheRed">In The Red</a></em> is invariably stoned and away with the fairies—right up to the second she goes on air, when she suddenly turns completely sane and professional.

</li><li> Likewise, Adrian Monk of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em> is normally unable to function in society due to his severe obsessive-compulsive disorder and fear of just about everything. However, once he sets foot in a crime scene, he can almost instantly solve the crime with the smallest or most overlooked pieces of evidence.
<ul><li> Monk's brother exhibits similar qualities: He has an extreme case of agoraphobia that prevents him from (nearly) ever leaving his house (as well as a related phobia that prevents him from entering the study of their father), but is evidently a highly skilled writer of technical manuals.

The biggest example is that Joey was the <em>only one</em> of the gang who actually figured out Monica and Chandler's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretRelationship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretRelationship">Secret Relationship</a> simply by putting 2 and 2 together while the others only found out when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">they either saw or heard them together.</a> He also figured out that Chandler lied about having just come home from Tulsa when he sees his suitcase already in the apartment. He can understand encyclopedia and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbassHasAPoint">on many instances has given legitimate points to the gang.</a> He even explained to Phoebe that Santa Claus isn't real and that a bee would die after it stings her, and also encouraged Chandler <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceYourFears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceYourFears">to face his fear of commitments</a>. Plus, Joey can be very serious when he puts his mind to it; such as how he got angry at Chandler for kissing his girlfriend or when he told the gang they shouldn't watch Phoebe's porn video to respect her privacy and refused to watch it himself while the others were watching it anyway. In many ways, Joey can act as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> of the gang.

</div><div class="indent"><em>[and finally]</em>
</div><div class="indent">Mathematics—94%—An obnoxious, self-satisfied, self-centered, shabby, dribbling, bone-idle, toadying cow-put of a pupil; his most revolting quality being that he is quite, quite brilliant.
</div><ul><li> He seems to have difficulty understanding things in his day-to-day life, but many of the solutions to the problems he faces are actually rather complicated, and, dare we say it, clever. In one prominent example in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bean">the film</a>, he spectacularly destroys an extremely valuable and famous painting by trying to remove a pen-ink stain with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">paint-thinner</a></em>, but later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">breaks into the gallery and successfully repairs the painting without being detected by the tight security</a>.

People should plunk down $2000 to live like him for a week. Sleep, do nothing, fall ass-backwards into money, mooch food off your neighbors and have sex without dating...<em>that's</em> a fantasy camp".

She's a literal birdbrain (a hell raven) who seems to forget what she was thinking after a few seconds and acts like a total airhead, yet she seems to have a vast knowledge of nuclear physics. She's been doing an excellent job of keeping the nuclear reactor that the Moriya shrine has set up from exploding, at least.

Ellis is most often the one to come up with the plan in Dead Center to use the stock car as their escape vehicle, then shows that he is familiar with this type of thing by mentioning that they don't fill up the tanks at car shows, so they need to find gas before they go. This is along with the same campaign, occasionally, Ellis will mention that when this whole thing started he had built an armored car, which he claimed was 99% zombie proof. (the other 1% tore it all to shit though.) While this may not make him the smartest, it does fit the trope.

</li><li> Sandal, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>, is explicitly identified as a savant. He barely talks (only saying "enchantment"), and mostly just stands around looking dopey, but he's a highly skilled enchanter. Also, at one point, he and his father get attacked. When you arrive on the scene, every mook around him is dead, and when you ask him what happened, he just says "Enchantment!". And again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>, during the Deep Roads expedition, Sandal's adoptive father notices he's missing and asks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Hawke</a> to find him. Upon locating the boy, the party sees a bunch of dead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent">darkspawn</a>, including a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithIce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithIce">frozen</a></em> ogre, with Sandal looking at Hawke innocently.

However, when it regards matters of the military or combat, he's <em>at least</em> highly competent, and perhaps a minor genius.

He's also fair at contract negotiations, as far as they concern getting as much money as possible for the job.

For example, he identifies the planet of origin and likely personality traits of one client just from his accent. A bit less impressive given that Tagon was from the planet in question, but still.

</li><li> Dr. Zoidberg is... an interesting take.

</li><li> Patrick, too. In at least one boating episode, he was shown to be perfectly accurate behind the wheel, as he could give perfect instructions to Spongebob simply via a large telescope, sometimes while barely paying attention, and in another episode, he even GOT a boating license despite not knowing everything there is to know about boats.

In his introductory short, he manages to make a working moon rocket out of items found around the house. The book <em>Cheese Lover's Yearbook</em> introduced a number of non-filmed gadgets of his, such as the Recyc-O-Matic. The fact that when said out loud this includes "Psycho" is significant, because after he put arms and wheels on it, it proceeded to run amok, recycling building fronts and people's clothes before crashing into a brass band.

Throughout the series, Bart has also been seen speaking Japanese and Cantonese. He also seems to have at least some proficiency with Latin. Bart may have inherited this from Homer.
</li><li> Ralph Wiggum. One episode had him playing a very talented George Washington in the school play. Or that he's a good Machiavellian politician, somehow uniting the Democrats and the Republicans in Springfield's presidential election by staying politically independent, and drove some effective campaign to get the majority of Springfield's votes.

In contrast Rebecca is well educated and has profound business ethics, but due to her pampered lifestyle is somewhat naive and inept to the outside world.

<ul><li> Sterling Archer is a boorish, egotistical jackass who is exceptionally bad at the "tradecraft" parts of spying... but not only is he remarkably good at the "action hero" parts, but he keeps dropping references to people like Alan Turing, Indira Gandhi, and Eugene V. Debs.

For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnlimitedWardrobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnlimitedWardrobe">all those colorful sweaters Mabel wears</a> are knitted by her. She even has one with a light-bulb on it that lights up when pressed, so it can light the way (as seen in "Into The Bunker").
</li><li> Old Man McGucket is an insane old coot who claims to be married to a raccoon, thinks there is someone else living in his mirror, and randomly shouts nonsense words and hillbilly slang.

<ul><li> From that same episode, the guest pet of the week, Scout, is damaging the Littlest Pet Shop's store property for reasons no one ever finds out. Vinnie, who gets basic common knowledge wrong and has problems paying attention to things, is the only one who can consistently outsmart Scout from causing any major trouble—and the only one able to stop Scout at all.
