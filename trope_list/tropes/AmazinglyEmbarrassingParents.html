This is for a very good reason — parents on TV seem to be on a quest to humiliate their children in front of their peers.
</p><p>They always have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">a thousand-and-one stories about things their unfortunate offspring did when they were two years old</a>, and they're always a thousand-and-one percent certain that <em>everyone</em> wants to hear them. And in that repsect, they're absolutely right, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightForTheWrongReasons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightForTheWrongReasons">just not for the reasons that they think</a> — the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> and her ilk are just <em>dying</em> to hear humiliating childhood stories, because they'll be able to tease the poor protagonist about them for years to come. Sometimes, childhood stories aren't even necessary: the parents' mere behavior, presence, or lifestyle are all it takes to turn a casual scene into something terribly awkward. Especially if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakingLikeTotallyTeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakingLikeTotallyTeen">the parents are bent on proving how "hip" and "cool" they are</a>. Older offspring whose parents are deeply embarrassing when their good friends are around just have to remember that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendsAreChosenFamilyArent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendsAreChosenFamilyArent">Friends Are Chosen, Family Aren't</a>. If they're a teacher, they'll become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingRelativeTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingRelativeTeacher">Embarrassing Relative Teacher</a>, making things even worse.

Due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">Rule of Drama</a>, the situation will be contrived for maximum hurt and the hero is likely to have to spend the rest of the episode trying to make amends, with the whole thing ending on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> about not being ashamed of your parents and the parents gaining empathy for their child.

</p><p>Sometimes it may not even be funny. A parent who is genuinely screwed-up or abusive can go beyond 'embarrassing' and into 'humiliating' territory.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, of course.

<ul><li> Toyota has an ad campaign with an insufferably smug kid pointing out the parents who are hideous caricatures of aging baby boomers humiliating their children by merely existing and driving something that isn't the company's big honkin' SUV.
<ul><li> A follow up ad marketing the car to the kids, rather than either set of parents, the same brat is in the backseat when they pull up alongside another kid with embarrassing parents, who have been singing "Morning Angel" 30 times in a row. He's embarrassed and traumatized by the singing, not the car; the apparent selling point is that the Toyota SUV comes standard with a back-seat monitor so the kid could have been able to drown them out. This is what happens when middle-aged ad execs make decisions based on whether or not the commercial makes them cool or "with it" to the kids.
</li></ul></li><li> A <em>Star Wars</em>-themed Disney World ad involves a father walking through a hardware store with his kids. He dons a welding mask and picks up a long fluorescent light, quoting Empire Strikes Back, before swinging his "Lightsaber" around until he falls over. Lesson of the day? Go to Disney World to work these impulses out.
<ul><li> ANY of the commercials in this campaign ("show us your Disney side") seem to imply that for adults, showing off their Disney side equals acting ridiculous, inappropriate, and immature almost to the point of mental illness.
</li></ul></li><li> In a 2011 San-Disk radio commercial, a mother asks her husband (the father) if he remembered to give their son the USB flash disk for his power-point presentation, and if he happened to edit out the baby pictures of him crawling around in diapers. The father tells her no, having her freak out then asking the time of the presentation and the current time, the father then suggests maybe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceDoneNeverForgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceDoneNeverForgotten">they can put him in another school</a>. It is done in a comical fashion, of course, but it is rather embarrassing because we can easily guess the outcome. The announcer ends by advertising this device with the slogan to keep the things you want to keep and take out the things you do not.
</li><li> A State Farm radio commercial from 2013 has a young man speaking to a female associate on the phone. He looks at the time and in response tells her that State Farm is there 24/7. His mother, on another line, at home, takes this literally, and asks him where were they when he needed to be changed, and tucked in (past the year of ten). The son, obviously, is very annoyed, tells her to hang up, and the female associate is flabbergasted that she tells him that she should end the phone conversation, but he pleads her not to disconnect.
</li><li> A commercial for a feminine-hygiene products delivery service called "Hello Flo" features a young girl who's feeling left out because all her friends have gotten their first periods, and she hasn't yet. So she gets the idea to fake it with red nail polish. Her mother finds it (and knows she was faking it), and throws her a "First Moon Party" to which everyone is invited. Eventually, the girl is so embarrassed that she confesses to lying about it, and the mother tells her she knows. The girl asks if she's going to be grounded for lying, and the mother replies, "Why do you think I threw you the First Moon Party?" (Implying that the embarrassment is punishment enough.)

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaijuGirlCaramelise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaijuGirlCaramelise">Kaiju Girl Caramelise</a></em>, Kuroe Akaishi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonoraryUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonoraryUncle">Honorary Uncle</a> Koutarou Hibino ends up meeting her crush Arata Minami at a metal festival. The first thing Koutarou does is jokingly claim to be Kuroe's boyfriend, much to their shock. He then bluntly asks Arata if <em>he</em> is Kuroe's boyfriend; Kuroe manages to awkwardly end that conversation by drawing attention to a band that is starting to play. Downplayed with Kuroe's actual mother Rinko, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">Genki Girl</a> personality and demands for hugs leave Kuroe a bit flustered, but as Rinko largely doesn't interact with anyone other than Kuroe it tends to get nipped in the bud.
</li><li> One of Murai's friends in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GreatTeacherOnizuka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GreatTeacherOnizuka">Great Teacher Onizuka</a></em> is incredibly ashamed of his super unattractive mother, which happens to be the total opposite of Murai's own situation with his mom. Murai's mother also embarrasses him when they drop in on a hot, sweaty day by only wearing a tank top and shorts. No bra.
</li><li> The series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KamisamaKazoku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KamisamaKazoku">Kamisama Kazoku</a></em> demonstrates why you do NOT want these parents to be gods with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> powers and total omniscience. When the main character, Samataro, is in school and idly thinking about the school's banning of revealing gym shorts for girls, his dad picks up on the thought. Dad immediately has the male teacher express his love for them, and come from behind the podium <em>wearing them</em>, to the total shock of the class. Also, Samataro's mother surprises the boy when he comes home by having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentFanserviceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentFanserviceGirl">herself</a> and his two sisters wear them! And then <em>Dad himself</em> comes out wearing them!
</li><li> It's a case of embarrassment all around in the fourth episode of the third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MariaSamaGaMiteru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MariaSamaGaMiteru">Maria-sama ga Miteru</a></em> when the cast's parents arrive for the school athletics carnival:
<ul><li> Normally quiet and reserved Shimako curls up in a little ball and whimpers when her father (a Buddhist monk who has just come from presiding over a funeral and is still in his robes) is paraded in front of the entire school as part of the scavenger hunt.
</li><li> In addition to her other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">issues</a> with her father, Sachiko finds his actions fit this when he meets Yumi, though her judgment may be clouded.
</li><li> Yumi is afraid her parents are going to do this to her when she introduces them to Sachiko for the first time.
</li><li> Yoshino's parents <em>do</em> do this to her in the novel that this episode was adapted from.
</li></ul></li><li> When Tamaki's kendo team visits her house in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BambooBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BambooBlade">Bamboo Blade</a></em> manga, her father wastes no time in breaking out the photo album, much to Tama-chan's chagrin. Then he brings put the video of her bathing as a child...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar">Lucky Star</a></em>, normally Konata is perfectly okay with her dad's otaku tendencies, being as she's just as much one herself, but it would be nice if he toned down the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicLolicon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicLolicon">Comedic Lolicon</a> aspects when visiting the school on sports day. Or with friends visiting <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note018v8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note018v8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note018v8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> (he's why she's unsure about having a sleepover with friends from school at her house)</span>. Or while her younger cousin is living with them while she attends Ryou-ou...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub">Ouran High School Host Club</a></em>:
<ul><li> Haruhi is embarrassed of her father. He's constantly trying to get her to dress more lady-like. Funny enough, the rest of the club seems fine with it. Oddly, she doesn't really care about the cross-dressing. Her views on gender identity are...relaxed (probably <em>because</em> she grew up with a dad who wears a dress). It seems to be more because Ryouji/Ranka, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentsAsPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentsAsPeople">for all of his good heart</a>, is both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad">bumbling</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad">overprotective</a>.
</li><li> Yuzuru to Tamaki might qualify. Tamaki doesn't seem to approve of his father's actions, even though they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a> in a couple ways.
</li></ul></li><li> Otoha from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Happiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Happiness">Happiness</a></em>, who is prone to greeting her son Yuuma enthusiastically while at school. As a result, Yuuma tends to avoid the cafeteria where she works.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePrinceOfTennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePrinceOfTennis">The Prince of Tennis</a></em>: Ryoma Echizen would be <em>very</em> grateful if his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass">Retired Badass</a> father Nanjirou also wasn't a meddling, smartass slob. He gets along better with his mother Rinko, even if he whines about how she cooks too much Western food for his taste.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicUsersClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicUsersClub">Magic User's Club</a></em>:
<ul><li> Aburatsubo's ultra-affectionate and ultra childish mom, Akiko. He does care for his mom, but is <em>terrified</em> at the mere prospect of her showing up at his school.
</li><li> Nanaka's mom is this too, once showing up to a school meeting while in her gardening clothes.
</li></ul></li><li> If <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">parental substitutes</a> count, there's Yayoi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KoeDeOshigoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KoeDeOshigoto">Koe de Oshigoto!</a></em>, who reveals a few choice anecdotes about her little sister Kanna to their co-workers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> "Don't forget to change your" "Alright, mom! Jeez!" Done regardless of who (friends, neighbors) or what (television cameras) is nearby, either. In the English dub, Delia is reminding Ash to change his underwear. In the original Japanese, she's reminding him to brush his teeth. The English dub exaggerated this as it has Delia embarrassing Ash more than she originally did.

</li><li> An early episode of the sitcom <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne">Roseanne</a></em> played with this trope, when an uptight Becky prepares to go meet her first boyfriend Chip in public, and her parents Roseanne and Dan jokingly threaten to come along, all the while picking their noses, turning their hats around backwards, etc.
<ul><li> The outtakes from that scene are particularly funny, as John Goodman was hamming it up so much that Roseanne repeatedly blew the take by laughing.
</li><li> Roseanne once invoked this as punishment for her kids. She dropped little DJ off at school in the most embarrassing manner possible, by wearing a set of hideous patchwork dungarees, a huge floppy hat with a flower, and slowly, deliberately, applying bright red lipstick in front of him so she could send him off with a biiig sloppy kiss...

Whenever she comes on board the ship, she's likely to condescend to Deanna every chance she gets, butt into other people's affairs, and try to score with an equally-irritated Captain Picard. She's supposed to be an telepath who reads thoughts and emotions.
</li><li> Worf's adoptive parents embarrass him too, but they're not as bad as other examples on this page. It has more to do with Worf's uptight nature than their behavior. They are actually rather sweet.

There's a reason his parents purged Data's earliest memories. Unlike most examples, however, Data lacks the ability to <em>be</em> embarassed, so he doesn't really mind and even finds the whole idea interesting.

It's further cemented when Klaus reveals that Stan keeps a pack of "inbred dinner wolves" in a trap-door under the kitchen floor to feed Francine's food to instead of eating it himself.

The two biggest examples are when Linda drags Louise to an 8-hour new age mother-daughter seminar in "Mother Daughter Laser Razor", and when Linda organizes a surprise slumber party for Louise without her permission, after Louise explicitly voiced her opposition to the concept, in "Slumber Party".

After the third time Renzo failed school, a television journalist snidely asked Bossi if Renzo was really his dolphin, prompting Bossi to reply: "That idiot there? At best he's a trout!".
</li><li> The mother of the Woodhouse brothers, two political pundits with opposing viewpoints, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/16/us/woodhouse-brothers-c-span/index.html">called them<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the middle of a show to chide them for their constant bickering.
</li><li> In an interview, US President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a> stated that he and his wife Michelle had decided to weaponize this trope. They promised their daughters Sasha and Malia that if either of them ever got a tattoo, both parents would get the exact same tattoo, in the exact same place on their bodies, and would show it off at every opportunity, calling it a "family tattoo". By all accounts, the threat worked perfectly.
<ul><li> Then there was the time he semi-jokingly threatened the Jonas Brothers with a drone strike.
</li></ul></li><li> John Dickens, father of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens">Charles Dickens</a> tragically so. He was notoriously financially irresponsible throughout his life and at one point while Charles was still a child, John was sent to debtor's prison and Charles had to drop out of school and go to work at a factory to help get his father out of debt. It got worse when Charles became a famous author, and John would send letters to his son's friends and associates begging for money.
</li><li> A Very Senior General in the British Army took the passing-out parade for a squad of newly-minted junior officers, who included his own daughter. Knowing her father's dubious sense of humour, she steeled herself for the ordeal. The general passed down the ranks, commenting and complimenting, attended by the squad's CO and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock">RSM</a>. Finally he arrived at his own daughter. Pretending not to know her, he turned to the RSM, who played along and prompted him.
<div class="indent">Underofficer Brown-Windsor, SAH! <br/>(<em>General Brown-Windsor, pretending to have his memory jogged</em>) Oh yes. You seem familiar from somewhere. Believe I might have met your mother once? (<em>pauses, reflects that he also has a son</em>) Probably <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSexualitySquick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSexualitySquick">twice</a></em>, come to think about it...
</div></li><li> Brad and Dallas Woodhouse are opposing political pundits, and <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/Q15xhG6pVUw">in 2014 they were on C-SPAN debating each other<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> when they get a call-in from <em>their mother</em>. Just watching them drop their heads and utter "Oh God it's Mom" is worth it.
