</p><p>Depending on how this is used, it can be a case of research failure that takes advantage of the audience's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfPerception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfPerception">inability to conceive of what's not visible on screen</a>, as most handguns without loaded cartridges will have a noticeable imbalance and difference in weight when compared with a fully loaded weapon. (This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> quite often in most modern-day usages of the trope  a professional who is familiar with the weapon being used can immediately notice the difference.) In addition, the lack of a magazine in a pistol or of rounds in revolver chambers is clearly visible. Additionally, many automatic and semi-automatic weapons pre-load one cartridge into the chamber before firing, so removing the magazine still leaves one live round in the chamber. A few handguns are designed so that removing the magazine disables the trigger, however, most notably the FN Five-SeveN and most versions of the Browning Hi-Power.
To be entirely honest, the chambered cartridge may be manually extracted and slide lock disengaged with but a thumb. More accurate works will actually display that. Ironically, the supposedly wacky comedy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBigLebowski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBigLebowski">The Big Lebowski</a></em> has it right in the single only-10-seconds-long gun scene of the movie, while many action flicks are epitome of research failure here despite having at least one firearm present in each and every frame.
A modern variant that avoids the obviously-lacking-ammunition problem is that a character will reveal that they've removed the firing pin from the weapon. This is, of course, a more time-consuming procedure that requires disassembly of the gun. Stories set in the near future might also have guns that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoyalPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoyalPhlebotinum">lock out anyone except the designated user(s) from firing them</a>; such "smart gun" technology actually exists in real life (<em>sort</em> of), but is not yet commercially available (and may never be that viable of a technology, as it has a number of downsides that all boil down to "one more thing to go wrong").

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat">Black Cat</a></em>: Train Heartnet pulls a version on himself - in order to test Sven's resolve, he hands Sven his gun, which has one bullet in it, in a random slot. He puts his hand on the table and tells Sven to shoot it. Sven, figuring that it's not loaded, shoots without hesitation. Turns out it <em>is</em> loaded... with a fake, harmless bullet.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em>: The end of the Nazi arc has Revy toss one of her Cutlasses to the neo-Nazi leader to do with as he likes, and tell Dutch "I bet on black." He agrees. The guy initially points the pistol at his own head, but then screams in rage and levels it at Dutch. Cue Revy laughing her ass off as the pistol clicks on an empty chamber: the bet was on which of them he'd try to shoot first ("black" being the African-American Dutch).
</li><li> Happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BreakBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BreakBlade">Break Blade</a></em>, in an unusually realistic case. The gun-pointer was a) a mech pilot, the wrong type of soldier entirely; b) using an unfamiliar model (and it probably helped that it was a quartz-firing gun, not a lead-firing one); and c) twelve years old. Her hostage (the queen, natch) played along, just to see how far she was willing to go (which happened to be all the way to pulling the trigger at an enemy she recognized).
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CastleInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CastleInTheSky">Castle in the Sky</a></em>: In the depths of the flying city the young hero Pazu is facing down the villain Muska (one of the slimiest villains in film, right up there with Mother Iselin). Pazu has his big grenade launcher, had been given two shells, which we know he has already used. So Pazu's bluffing. Muska has his handgun leveled at Pazu, however, he lowers it, apparently falling for the bluff. But why? A real close look will show Miyazaki's attention to the details. The shot is looking over Muska's shoulder and we see his handgun with the hammer pulled down ... and it's obvious there's NO bullets in the chamber — having run out of bullets too!
</li><li> A <em>magnificent</em> example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CatsEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CatsEye">Cat's Eye</a></em> (from the same author as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter">City Hunter</a></em>): <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">a criminal has just discovered the guys who egged him to brag about his crimes were</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">cops</a></em>, and to escape he produces his gun... At which point one of the cops produces <em>the gun's magazine</em> he had stolen from him earlier that day.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> in a chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter">City Hunter</a></em>, when Ryo faced a rival sweeper calling himself the Bat. The Bat believed that his early defeat was due Ryo's gun having been improved to become more accurate by a legendary gunsmith, so Ryo, to free the gunsmith's daughter (who was just as good as her father), accepted to duel him with switched guns, with the Bat handing Ryo an unloaded gun... And getting beaned when Ryo outdrew him and <em>threw the gun at him</em> because he had noticed it was unloaded.
</li><li> Happens in the very first scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheDaughterOfTwentyFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheDaughterOfTwentyFaces">The Daughter of Twenty Faces</a></em>. Chiko herself manages to pull it off by the end of the second episode.
</li><li> During a bus-jacking incident in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>, Jodie plays up her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyForeigner">Funny Foreigner</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">antics</a> to get close to one of the jackers and secretly disabling his gun. When his accomplices are taken care of, he tries to fire it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWithTheSafetyOnYouWont" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWithTheSafetyOnYouWont">with predictable results</a>.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/EatMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/EatMan">Eat-Man</a></em>, when a bad guy gives Bolt a gun belonging to another character. When Bolt pulls it out on him later, he brags about having removed all the bullets first. Bolt shoots him with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBuwwetWeft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBuwwetWeft">another bullet</a> he caught in his teeth earlier.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero">The Familiar of Zero</a></em>: Fouquet steals the Staff of Destruction, a legendary artifact, from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool">Wizarding School</a>. But she can't figure out how it works. So she arranges for it to be recovered by the main characters and attacks them with a golem. It goes according to her plan: Saito destroys the golem with it, showing her how to use it, then she steals it back and points it at him. He's not especially worried, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the "Staff of Destruction" is really just a LAW — a single-use, disposable rocket launcher — and he had just used its only rocket on the golem</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GalileiDonna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GalileiDonna">Galilei Donna</a></em>: The Ferrari family is being threatened by a group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkyPirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkyPirates">sky pirates</a>. Then there's a lot of rumbling and general chaos brought on by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the youngest daughter breaking her goldfish-airship out of the basement</span> and the eldest child manages to grab the leader's gun... which was never loaded in the first place.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em>. In <em>Human Error Processor</em>, Section 9 have removed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">More Dakka</a> from a suitcase as they're expecting an imminent attack, only to be startled by their former colleague Motoko walking in on them. After they reflexively point their guns at her, Motoko points out that the weapons wouldn't be transported with a round in the chamber.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl">Gunslinger Girl</a></em> has Henrietta doing this with one of the handlers' guns in order to reenact Elsa's tragic murder/suicide scene, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoeGreeneSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoeGreeneSpecial">aiming the gun at her eye</a> as Elsa had done before pulling the trigger. This serves to scare the living hell out of her own handler, Giuseppe (and the audience, as the way the scene is intercut leads us to believe that she's trying to kill herself for real), until she opens her eyes and shows him the bullets, revealing that she had unloaded the weapon before pulling this stunt.
</li><li> Subverted in the anime of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunsmithCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunsmithCats">Gunsmith Cats</a></em>, when Rally was given a gun <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootYourMate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootYourMate">to prove her loyalty</a>. Since she was a firearms expert, she could tell the gun was unloadedand played as if she was going to shoot the cop anyway. But only after angrily asking if they wanted her to club him to death, provoking them to give her a bullet.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWestern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWestern">The Western</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoujoDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoujoDemographic">Shōjo (Demographic)</a> manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Miriam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Miriam">Miriam</a></em>, protagonist Douglas is menaced by an enemy who stole his gun. The villain, who isn't particularly familiar with firearms, lets out an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh">Evil Laugh</a> and starts speechifying, before pulling the trigger several times to find an empty gun. When Douglas picks up the other guy's gun and turns the tables on him, he weakly insists that that gun, too, is empty, and Douglas knows he's bluffing because he can feel the difference.
</li><li> During a scene in the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em>, Flay (left in Rau's office after he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">rescues her from being killed in the Alaska fiasco on a whim</span>) gets a gun out of his desk and tries to attack him when he comes back in. Rau's response is to lecture her that attacking the one person with any interest in keeping her safe is ridiculous, especially when the gun's not even loaded in the first place.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TriGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TriGun">Trigun</a></em>involves this in the beginning of episode 5 "Hard Puncher". A bunch of bandits burst into a cafe and unload on Vash the Stampede. It's only later we learn that the whole scenario turned out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring">A-Team Firing</a> and the only thing that got hit was his bottle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ABloodyMess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ABloodyMess">tomato juice</a>. He then demonstrates he's very much in control when he headshots all of them...with a suction cup gun. One of the bandits gets ticked and decides to go shooting again. Vash basically says, "Go nuts." He does. *<em>click</em>*

Later, Snake Eyes managed to grab one while Kwinn was distracted, and even inserted an emergency magazine into the clearly unloaded gun, but depressing the trigger only resulted in "click click click". Turns out Kwinn took out all the firing pins and put them on his necklace to make what he jokingly called "a charm against gunfire."

The first thing Deadshot does upon being issued a .45 pistol is to point it at Griggs, the prison guard he promised to kill earlier.

While it might count as a subversion for the viewer because the audience would be expecting more typical Hollywood gun rules, its pretty doubtful that the villain would think the gun is empty given that the pair are both former Special Forces and SWAT. It is likely that the villain was trying to throw off his opponent by convincing him it was empty.

The main character, John Taylor has a gift that enables him to find anything: an often neat trick is to find the bullets of a loaded gun in his hand. Whilst the mook is pointing said gun at him. When confronted by multiple mooks carrying assault rifles, his hands literally pour bullets. On occasion, he has threatened to do the same trick; but with their <em>internal organs</em>.

During the final fight scene, an evil elf casts a spell on one of the heroes that deactivates the ammo in his gun. She then ignores that hero, because his only weapon is the gun, and, well, see the trope name. Too bad she'd never learned about speedloaders.
</li><li> Many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> novels have used a depleted phaser for the same effect.

Then Choard's nephew threatens the other three troopers with his E-11, reveals who he is, and forces them to put their blasters down before handing his to Choard. Choard then incriminates himself, and when his nephew protests, threatens to shoot him, but the trooper says, "No, uncle. Because you made one final mistake. You think that blaster is loaded." He'd taken out the power pack, and while it turned out there is one shot left, it doesn't do Choard any good.

Moments later, Han finds out about their plan to kill him and take his ship, and when he aimed at the leader he finds that she'd removed the power pack. However, as <em>she</em> finds out a page or two later, he had also removed his. Unfortunately for Han, her friends have hold-out blasters.

One of them is an Eskimo; knowing the Japanese's gun will jam when brought out into the cold, he then kills him with a knife.
</li><li> The "removed the firing pin" variant is used in Lisa Gardner's <em>The Third Victim</em>, but it fails. The killer checks the gun before his confrontation with Rainie. He, on the other hand, did not remove the firing pin because he knew she would catch it. Instead, he filed the pin back just enough that the gun would be useless for shooting.

The Joker is still impressed that she pulled the trigger. (It should be noted though that the Joker didn't know the gun was a fake, either.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>:
<ul><li> Subverted in "Turkey Guys", when Peter and Brian, attempting to return home with a new turkey for Thanksgiving, are mugged by a man in a car in the same dilemma. Brian is understandably shocked, but Peter tries to bluff him, claiming "I bet that thing's not even loaded!" He takes a bullet to the foot for the trouble. He continues anyway, now assuming "you just used your last bullet!", and takes another one to the other foot. When he tries to bluff a <em>third</em> time and takes a third bullet to the arm for it, is when he finally gives up and tells Brian to hand over the turkey.
</li><li> In "Quagmire's Quagmire", Peter and Joe try to save Quagmire from his new girlfriend, who has kidnapped him and is keeping him for her sex slave. During the confrontation, she gets a hold of Joe's gun and tries to shoot them, but it wasn't loaded because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">the force barred him from having bullets following a mental breakdown</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> A variant of this trope happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> when the Flash uses his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> to take the power supply off the Ultra-Humanite's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathRay">Death Ray</a> while he wasn't looking. Since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSuper">enjoys being a dick to villains</a>, he'll find a way to use this when there's no actual ammo. In an early episode, he super-speed pats on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithMonkeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithMonkeys">Gorilla Grodd's</a> mind-control helmet, then goads Grodd into using it. Fortunately for Flash, and unfortunately for Grodd, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReversePolarity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReversePolarity">reversed the polarity</a> while he was tapping on it. A predictable fate ensues for Grodd. A similar thing happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCTheNewFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCTheNewFrontier">Justice League: The New Frontier</a></em> with Captain Cold. Flash had rewired Captain Cold's ice gun whilst falling into a fountain after Flash snatched him out of a helicopter.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> short "Daffy Duck Hunting", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaffyDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaffyDuck">Daffy Duck</a> empties the buckshot out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PorkyPig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PorkyPig">Porky Pig</a>'s shotgun shells, then allows Porky to blast away at him to no effect.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, Homer is holding Snake at gunpoint. He looks away to apologize to Marge for not getting rid of the gun, at which point Snake snags it out of Homer's hand and takes aim. Homer then holds up a box of bullets and taunts Snake with the knowledge of the gun being unloaded. Snake then aims again and demands that Homer hand over the bullets. Homer promptly forgets his taunt and surrenders the ammo. also saying "Okay! Don't shoot!"

<ul><li> It is the standard operating procedure when dropping prisoners at a jail for patrol officers to leave their guns unloaded for this very reason (for the reason that they are generally alone). Corrections officers that are involved in transport, however, have numbers and shotguns on their side, as well as the fact that the prisoners are better secured than with standard handcuffs.
</li><li> There's a kind of gun with a grip that senses how you hold it and can recognize its owner. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoyalPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoyalPhlebotinum">If anyone else pulls the trigger, it won't fire.</a> Biometric-based safeties are a long way from being practical yet, but there are pistols made by Armatix that will only fire if the pistol is being held by someone wearing a wristwatch that is paired to the firearm. They have partnered with Anschutz to release a line of target rifles that use this technology as well.
<ul><li> Heckler &amp; Koch used to market a variant of their P7 pistol that had a manual safety catch operated by a small key, but it wasn't a great success.
</li><li> There's also a ring that disengages a magnetic safety on a revolver. Without the ring, the revolver won't fire.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEmbellished" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEmbellished">Life Embellished</a> book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MyFamilyAndOtherAnimals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MyFamilyAndOtherAnimals">My Family and Other Animals</a></em>; Gerry's oldest brother Larry, a bossy writer, insists to the next-oldest brother Leslie, a keen hunter, that Larry can hunt just as well as Leslie can. They go hunting together, and when the birds appear, Larry enthusiastically pulls the triggers, proving that he forgot to load the gun.
</li><li> Display guns at stores generally don't have firing pins in them, so they can't be used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BallisticDiscount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BallisticDiscount">against the owners</a> even when fully loaded.
</li><li> Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme learned this the hard way during her assassination attempt on Gerald Ford. She attempted to kill the president with a Colt M1911, but she did not know that she needed to rack the slide to chamber a round after loading the magazine.
</li><li> The whole reason for the "Israeli Draw" technique was that a soldier might be using an unfamiliar firearm, so when drawing their own or picking up another's sidearm to cock the weapon immediately. Then again, if there's only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBulletLeft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBulletLeft">One Bullet Left</a>, this will unload the gun entirely.
</li><li> A particularly spectacular example happened at the Battle Of Lissa (1866) between the Austrian and Italian Navies. After several successful rams the Austrian flagship <em>Erzherzog Ferdinand Max</em> was caught at point blank range by the Italian ironclad <em>Ancona</em> which fired a full broadside, only to discover that the Italian gunners had forgotten to load any shot into the guns. Unsurprisingly this meant the broadside had no effect on the Austrian flagship.
</li><li> The British military's Enfield L85A1 assault rifle became notorious for this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReliablyUnreliableGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReliablyUnreliableGuns">among other problems</a> before and during the Persian Gulf War. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDCRop6CRwY">As detailed by<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ForgottenWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ForgottenWeapons">Forgotten Weapons</a>, it was discovered that it was easy to accidentally eject the magazine while walking with the weapon unslung across the chest, as the bullpup configuration put the release button on the left side of the rifle against the soldier's web gear. This of course left many an unaware British soldier with only the one round in the chamber to use. Heckler &amp; Koch's rework of the rifle as the L85A2 included adding a partial cover over the mag release to fix the problem.
