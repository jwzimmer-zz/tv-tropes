<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AfterschoolCharisma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AfterschoolCharisma">Afterschool Charisma</a></em>, clones may be treated as backup copies, but Shiro (and Mr. Kuroe) sees them as this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Phoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Phoenix">Phoenix</a></em>: <em>Life</em> deals strongly with this idea when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the main character, a selfish TV executive, is cloned and sent to be slaughtered for sport with his many copies.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>:
<ul><li> This is generally the prevalent attitude regarding all the clone characters (which by the end of <em>StrikerS</em> is approximately half the cast). Precia Testarossa is about the only character who doesn't share this perspective, and the reason she hated Fate is because she <em>wasn't</em> the same person as the girl she was cloned from, and Precia wanted a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">Replacement Goldfish</a>. The movie backpedaled on this slightly, with Precia realizing much too late that Fate was effectively the little sister Alicia had always wanted.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaVivid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaVivid">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha ViVid</a></em>, it's revealed that while Vivio very closely resembles the woman she was cloned from, there are physical as well as personality differences between them (most notably, the fact that Olivie had no arms, though Vivio's "adult mode" also shows that she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomIsBetter">bigger</a> than her predecessor).
</li><li> The clones also have various relationships with who they're cloned from depending on the age difference and their situation. Dream!Alicia considered Fate to be a younger sister, Quint viewed Ginga and Subaru as her daughters (although she had adopted them long before finding out they were cloned from her), Erio and Zest both see themselves as continuations of their originals, and Vivio is treated as Olivie's descendant by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaintlyChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaintlyChurch">Saint Church</a>. Nove also considers Quint to be her mother, but this has more to do with her being adopted by Quint's widower Genya than any genetic connection.

While initially they were all nearly exactly the same, after the experiment ended the network that links them allowed them to start differentiating slightly, though despite what the main characters think they still don't consider themselves entirely distinct from each other. In fact, it's impossible to separate them like that.

Furthermore, thanks to their emotional restrictions they play a vital part in ensuring the world peace after two destructive world wars.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em>:

</li><li> Also, this trope is specifically why the current <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s plan - which hinged on every person's being, belief, and therefore role in life would be determined their genes - falls apart with its logic.

<ul><li> Brianna as a composite clone of Gina and Britanny who was produced in a lab accident. She was quickly adopted into the family, and although she suffered a (perfectly understandable) lengthy identity crisis, she is now very much her own person.
</li><li> The genie Madrid, an old enemy of Gina's, once shapeshifted into Gina's form and got stuck that way. Unable to change back, she found Gina's copied personality slowly encroaching on her own. Later, after another scheme failed spectacularly, she suffered a terrible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a> and raped by she-dragons and her evil half effectively lost the will to live, so the duplicate Gina personality (with Madrid's memories) has been dominant ever since. After some initial misgivings, Gina has decided she can trust her, and the two have become friends.
</li><li> Another example, though not a clone, per se, is Raphael, the male Were-Cheetah Golem created to disrupt Brittany and Stripe's wedding. Once the situation was peacefully resolved, the priestess who created him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">destroyed him for failing</a>, but Brianna snatched the piece containing his soul/memories, as she empathized with him for also being an artificially-created being. Which bring us to...
</li><li> ...Array, a villainess who can created doubles of herself with different skills, abilities, and even species'. She can discorporate them, but their personalities remain inside of her (thus her name), and she can re-call them at any time rather than making a new "self". When Brianna runs afoul of her while looking for a way to help Raphael, Array also sympathizes with her, and helps her create a new form and life for Raphael.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope is the whole point of <em>Heart Breakers</em> by Paul Guinan and Anina Bennett. Most of the cast are clones of Theresa Sorenson, who died midway through the series. The two main characters, Delta and Queenie, have radically different personalities. They live in a world where clones have to struggle for legal rights.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a>: Fatal Frontier</em>, Tony Stark's ruining of a clone's life in issue 10 is seen as completely disgusting, and a sign that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">phlogistone</span> is poisoning his mind.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YTheLastMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YTheLastMan">Y: The Last Man</a></em>: The series has this likelihood <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> at the end of the series, where cloning is used to preserve the human race</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a></em> actually has this. In the original '80s incarnation, there were "baby" versions of several ponies; Baby Shady, Baby Heartthrob, etc. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MyLittlePony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MyLittlePony">comic</a> even adds a Baby Applejack and Baby Firefly. They looked and acted just like the originals but smaller and with simplified cutie marks. The show never questions this but the UK comic has a story about a magic mirror that creates them (well, two of them, but the others can be presumed to have the same origin) in response to their mothers' wish. They get their own storylines and are generally characters unto themselves, and nobody finds cloning yourself with a magic mirror to be a bad thing. (Compare to when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS3E3TooManyPinkiePies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS3E3TooManyPinkiePies">Pinkie Pie tried something similar</a>.)
</li><li> In the Marvel Comics <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> series, there were a group of Autobots whose origins were "Some Autobots back on Cybertron made full copies of their data to be put into new bodies if needed; guess what, now we need 'em." By <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a>, that makes the Earth versions of them just the same as many a <em>tragic</em> clone; suddenly someone else is living your life and you're an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpendableClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpendableClone">Expendable Clone</a>. The fact that there are other versions of these four wandering around on Cybertron never comes up. Presumably the Earth versions of them never complain because they did volunteer for it; they probably thought "Hey, I'm on that weird "Earth" planet now; let me take care of the crisis that's bad enough to activate this plan, and worry about which "me" gets my room back home later, assuming there's a later." Sadly, we never <em>do</em> get to see any member of this group meet up with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateSelf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateSelf">Alternate Self</a>. In general, as befitting alien robots, their views on creating life and what makes you "alive" isn't quite the same as a human.
</li><li> The 3rd Loki owes their existence to a misfired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningGambit">Cloning Gambit</a> by the original Loki. Misfired because whatever was past Loki's true essence it got destroyed or lost in the process so the resulting <em>clone</em> body had a new soul and the personality copy originally intended to restore his memories and powers ended up killing an innocent child when it took over... And feeling very guilty about it. They spent most of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/YoungAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/YoungAvengers">Young Avengers</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LokiAgentOfAsgard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LokiAgentOfAsgard">Loki: Agent of Asgard</a></em> trying to figure out how to be their own person and if it's even possible (at this point they mucked with the original Norse myths and broke the timeline, if they fail it won't be because of lack of trying).
</li><li> This causes some friction in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WITCH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WITCH">W.I.T.C.H.</a></em> between the Guardians and their Astral Drops, that, differently from the animated adaptation, are always sentient... And don't like being treated as mere substitutes. The resentment coming from this causes quite some trouble, at least until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">the Oracle</a> intervenes while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">calling the Guardians out on their actions</a>.
<ul><li> Differently from the others, Hay Lin's copy Pao Chai <em>doesn't</em> resent her original, as Hay Lin treated her as a sister with an "unusual" situation and her own personality, with the only caveat that she referred to herself as Hay Lin while covering for her (Pao Chai was the only one who choose her name and was quite insistent on being called that-leading to Hay Lin realizing she was indeed her own person and them making their pact). That causes some friction between <em>Pao Chai and the other Astral Drop</em>, as while she goes along with their rebellion it's more out of solidariety and would prefer not causing Hay Lin trouble.
</li></ul></li><li> Discussed in a Twelfth Doctor <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/DoctorWhoMagazine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/DoctorWhoMagazine">Doctor Who Magazine</a></em> comic story, where Clara encounters one of her own splinters for the first time since she created them in "The Name of the Doctor". She is horrified to realise that she might have created thousands of young women who, unknowingly, existed only to sacrifice themselves for the Doctor. She is then reassured when the splinter, despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath">appearances at one point</a>, survives the adventure.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em> has many clones, including the protagonist himself. Though all are genetically identical, their personalities and history vary wildly. Where Dredd himself became a celebrated Judge, his clone-brother Rico turned to criminal ways and was ultimately killed for it. Another clone, Dolman, decided to quit the Academy to join the Space Corps instead.
</li><li> Artificial humans in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Copperhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Copperhead">Copperhead</a></em> are genetically programmed to seek out and win fights, but have agency to determine how they do it. Many are soldiers, some are employed as guards or enforcers. Ishmael specifically goes out of his way to avoid people and larger conflicts but will step into any unjust scenario to protect the weak.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ContestOfChampions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ContestOfChampions">Contest of Champions</a></em> issue #9, the Maestro points out Thunderstrike is just a clone of Thor. He murmurs that while it is true, he didn't have to say it so rudely.

But not because of the Love Triangle: it's because Vision's mind is based on that of Simon. Jazz, literature, chess... everything he likes comes from him. He could dismiss it and be his own person while Simon was dead, but now that he's alive, he feels like an Expendable Clone.

In fact, highly-skilled people are often cloned multiple times in order to preserve their genetics. Clones often take the name of the original but add a middle name that consists of "C" (for "clone") and an ordinal number. For example, Peter C-the-forty-fourth Valk is the 44th clone of Peter Valk. While not outright mentioned, it can be assumed that the problems of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloneDegeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloneDegeneration">Clone Degeneration</a> have been solved, given that the main theme of the novel is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticEngineeringIsTheNewNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticEngineeringIsTheNewNuke">Genetic Engineering Is the New Nuke</a>.

He also finds a boy named Tommy Arano, who turns out to be the original clone of Curtis van Curtis, who had his memory erased by aliens and adopted by a human family. Arthur was created under the mistaken assumption that the previous one was dead (memory erasure triggers aTan just like death).

However as the clone grows, and Tucker's memories, and even feelings start to emerge, they're suddenly faced with a moral dilemma when it's discovered that the clone won't survive the operation, and when it's discovered there's a potential method to extend his life, making it possible to live out normally. This causes a lot of troubling feelings within the crew when they start to wonder if Tucker's life is more valuable than his own clone.

Some of the clones are okay with this, some of them... aren't.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em>, Danny treats his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeSexClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeSexClone">Opposite-Sex Clone</a> Danielle (or Dani for short) as a family member of sorts, since she was the only clone that wasn't mindless, and she does a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> when she realizes Vlad, her "father", only viewed her as a tool, and helps Danny escape. In her second appearance, not only is he determined to save from her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloneDegeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloneDegeneration">instability</a> and keep from from melting into nothing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct">Danny was willing to WILLINGLY become the prisoner of a GHOST HUNTER to save her</a>, though said hunter decides to let him go instead.
</li><li> Cubert of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> is a clone of Professor Farnsworth. He's treated like his son and is good friends with Hermes' son Dwight. The only time being a clone seemed to affect his personal life was when it became apparent that he didn't technically have a birthday but this was remedied by celebrating the day the professor scraped the growth off his back he used to create him instead.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith">Played With</a> in one episode, when Farnsworth and Cubert are put on trial for over-clocking Bender. Fearing the jury wouldn't want to convict a child, Mom's lawyer moves to have Cubert excused from the verdict. Bender then points out that the Professor must now be acquitted as well on the grounds of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw">double jeopardy</a>, since Farnsworth and Cubert are "technically the same person", and "cannot be tried of the same crime twice." The Judge agrees, calling it a "brilliant legal shenanigan." It's doubtful such an argument would fly in real life.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em>, Thailog is a clone of Goliath, and is treated as Goliath's son, rather than a copy. Unfortunately he was programmed with the personality of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Xanatos</a>, and was raised by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilutionaryBiologist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilutionaryBiologist">Sevarius</a> (which pretty well eliminated any positive aspects of Xanatos' personality from Thailog), and ended up becoming a villain.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/GravityFallsS1E7DoubleDipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/GravityFallsS1E7DoubleDipper">"Double Dipper"</a>, Dipper clones himself in order to enact a plan to get close to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush">Wendy</a>. Him and the clones are quite friendly towards each other <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">at first</span>, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">Paper</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloneDegeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloneDegeneration">Jam</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible">Dipper</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with at least some of the clones still obviously acting like <em>people</em> even after turning against the original</span>, and Dipper gets quite upset when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tyrone is killed, even turning out to still miss him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/GravityFallsS2E15TheLastMabelcorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/GravityFallsS2E15TheLastMabelcorn">over a season later</a>. Oddly, the episode uses both this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpendableClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpendableClone">Expendable Clone</a>, since Dipper doesn't seem to have problems with destroying the clones besides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalImportance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalImportance">Tyrone</a>.</span>

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot">ReBoot</a></em>, the copy of Enzo is <em>encouraged</em> to be a different person than the original Enzo. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetiesAntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetiesAntiHero">Given what happened to the original</a>, this is a good idea.
<ul><li> Bob's friends (including the copy of Enzo) attempt to cheer him up by citing this trope when he's led to believe that he's a copy of another Bob that shows up in Mainframe. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Subverted when they find out that the other Bob is actually a trojan horse with stolen bits of Bob's code.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooAndTheCyberChase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooAndTheCyberChase">Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase</a></em>, the gang treats the video game versions of themselves as real people, not just computer data.

<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsTheCloneWarsS1E1Ambush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsTheCloneWarsS1E1Ambush">"Ambush"</a>, the first aired episode after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PilotMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PilotMovie">Pilot Movie</a>, despite the fact that the clones were created as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpendableClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpendableClone">Expendable Clones</a>, Yoda takes this attitude, telling the clones with him, "Smaller in number are we, but larger in mind." The clone troopers themselves naturally take this attitude, seeing each other as brothers, and over any period of time tend to start differentiating themselves with varying hairstyles, facial hair, and tattoos in addition to customizing and marking their armor.
</li><li> Other episodes have looked into this as well  Captain Rex and Commander Cody are treated as unique characters with different personalities, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsTheCloneWarsS2E10TheDeserter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsTheCloneWarsS2E10TheDeserter">one deserter</a> has a life outside the war, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsTheCloneWarsS1E16TheHiddenEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsTheCloneWarsS1E16TheHiddenEnemy">yet another</a> betrayed the Republic out of resentment towards the clones' status, and so on.
