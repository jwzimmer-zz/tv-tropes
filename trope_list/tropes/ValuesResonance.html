Fascist abusive Frollo, justice for the oppressed, the focus on how some men really do loathe the object of their desire, the wholesale demonization of ethnic groups. Maybe this movie wasn't really appreciated in its time because it didn't resonate as much in 1996, but it does resonate more in 2017. [...] And consider that hokey as it may be at points, like Hugo's message about the importance of architecture in the 1830s, this might be what we need in our time."</em>

The attitudes of our society have changed, or the issue they addressed has become obsolete.
</p><p>But others—like a good wine or fine cheeses—only get better with age. Years after the original author and audience have passed, new generations will still look at the given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop">Aesop</a> and say "Damn straight." Maybe some authors knowingly spoke to issues that were years ahead of their time. Maybe many of society's questions are just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a>. Maybe they just got lucky. These are the principles that stand the test of time and have outlived the original moral issue they were meant to address a hundred times over.
</p><p>Even when a work is non-ideological, it can still resonate due to tapping into a style or gimmick that would not become popular for many years. Art historians have pointed out, for example, that paintings in the nonrepresentational or abstract style were created in the 16th century by Italian painter Giuseppe Arcimboldo—a full 300 years before expressionism became fashionable in Western art.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Keep in mind that this is somewhat a subjective trope, as what resonates as an accurate observation for a conservative may not be the same as a liberal, for a woman may not be the same as for a man, for a devoutly religious person may not be the same as an atheist, for a citizen of one country not the same as a citizen of another, and so on. The best advice (as always applicable when one deals with the internet) is to keep an open mind. Likewise, do not assume that merely because it is <em>old</em> that it is <em>accurate</em>.
</p><p>But while this is somewhat subjective, there is a key guideline that should be borne in mind when considering examples. The key element of this trope is that the value or values presented or portrayed in the example resonate with an audience culturally removed from the originally intended or expected audience. It is not resonance when the values in a work are significant or meaningful to the audience for which the work was originally made; a thing does not resonate with itself. That usually requires that the work is from an earlier time or from a different culture than the audience with whom the work is resonating. There is some flexibility here for certain media or works <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleetingDemographicRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleetingDemographicRule">where the intended audience moves on after only a few years</a>, but even that flexibility is limited, since, just because the audience has moved on, it does not follow that the work is now being consumed by a fundamentally separate culture.

Compare and contrast with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay">Fair for Its Day</a>, where the morals the work presents are kind of squicky, but compared to other opinions from its age, very forward-thinking. Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalPeriodPiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalPeriodPiece">Unintentional Period Piece</a>, where the setting and narrative fluff of the work ties it to a single time period (though note that it can still overlap with this if the themes are louder than its cultural trappings).

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claudine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claudine">Claudine...!</a></em> has a rather sympathetic portrayal of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">transgender</a> person, despite having been written in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>. And although a significant number of elements of the plot can still be regarded now as unintentionally transphobic or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope">Dead Horse Trope</a> (especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays">Bury Your Gays</a>), it is still quite a friendly and up-to-date story, while even now most transgender people are portrayed in anime either as perverts or as flat comedic characters.
</li><li> People complain that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> is outdated and all, having been created in the very early nineties, but it has <em>several</em> concepts that are <em>timeless</em>:
<ul><li> There was a lesbian pairing portrayed in a sympathetic light (Haruka and Michiru), and the villainous gay couple from the anime <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasLovedOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasLovedOnes">loved each other deeply</a> despite their alignment (Zoicite and Kunzite).
</li><li> The girls themselves had all kinds of different personalities and were still friends in spite of how different they were. They also encouraged each other's goals <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0gi97');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0gi97" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0gi97');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">e.g. when Minako tells Yaten in the anime that even when her top priority was her Senshi mission and protecting Usagi, she still was a girl with a dream and Usagi herself told her to pursue it.</span> and supported each other when needed instead of throwing each other under the bus for their own benefits (and the girls who did it weren't supposed to be in the right). On a related note, all of the Sailor Senshi's individual personality traits often bust up stereotypes as well. For instance, the character who states her dream is to "be a bride" in the manga, Makoto, is also a black belt in judo and one of the physically and mentally strongest characters in the <em>Sailor Moon</em> universe. And Michiru, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamatoNadeshiko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamatoNadeshiko">Yamato Nadeshiko</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElegantClassicalMusician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElegantClassicalMusician">Elegant Classical Musician</a>, is all but stated to actually be the one with the reins in her and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen">Haruka's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians">relationship</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneGuy">Mamoru</a> helped them, but he also needed help and protection from Usagi and the girls. In fact, he needed more rescue than Usagi herself! And while he sometimes worried a lot about Usagi's safety (to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> levels in <em>R</em>), he didn't do it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">out of manly pride</a> but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMe">out of sincere concern</a>.
</li><li> The manga in particular emphasizes that Usagi is a sexual person and has had sex with her boyfriend Mamoru to the point of being shown lying naked in bed with him on several occasions, but she's never portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming">dirty</a> for this or that it somehow disqualifies her from being both the hero and the epitome of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">Incorruptible Pure Pureness</a>, with her sexuality simply being a part of the larger picture of who she is. She's also shown to be absolutely head over heels in love with several girls (including Rei, who gives her literal heart eyes when they first meet) but again, it's simply a part of who she is.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>'s prequel manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodenameSailorV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodenameSailorV">Codename: Sailor V</a></em>, one chapter has an obsessive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku">Otaku</a> who keeps harassing Minako because he simply can't deal with the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GamerChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GamerChick">she</a> beat his high score in a video game (even going so far as to assume that she must be a guy in drag), plus his whole spiel about how girls shouldn't be "invading" arcades. When his harassment goes too far, Minako (as Sailor V) proceeds to knock him out. The manga started in 1992, but this particular chapter is still pretty relevant today, especially with the surge in harassment of female gamers and fans during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a> for supposedly being "fake geek girls".
</li><li> While certain aspects like the teacher-student romances have not aged well, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura's</a></em> matter of fact, wholesome depiction of bisexual characters is something rarely seen in modern adult entertainment, yet alone a kids show from the 90s. Yukito and Touya are also a rare explicitly stated and canon gay couple in an anime not of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoysLoveGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoysLoveGenre">Boys' Love Genre</a>, and their relationship is a lot healthier than a lot of relationships <em>in</em> that genre to this day.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em> features largely modern views on homo- and bisexuality, defying traditional gender norms, and domestic abuse. It stars a girl who excels at sports and swordfighting, who dresses in male clothing, and dreams of becoming a "Prince" while falling in love with the "Rose Bride" Anthy Himemiya. Compared to how these subjects were usually played in the 1990s when the series was made, the show comes across as being twenty years ahead of its time.
</li><li> <em>Romeo's Blue Skies</em> is an anime about a boy who sells himself to become a chimney sweep and in the process, finds many good friends who help him whenever he has trouble. This show is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">NOT subtle in its message that</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a> is awesome and how it conveys this with the two main characters, Romeo and Alfredo. Considering how nowadays modern-day boys get persecuted by showing even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">tiniest bit of friendship-like (whether romantic or not) affection for other boys</a> just because others say it's gay, this message gets more and more relevant every year.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SorcererStabberOrphen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SorcererStabberOrphen">Sorcerer Stabber Orphen</a></em>, the deal with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Stephanie being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">transgender</a> person</span> is not handled for cheap and offensive laughs. When Orphen explains to Cleao and Majic how <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she went from the male-bodied Stephan to the female-bodied Stephanie</span>, he does it in a matter-of-fact way and doesn't think less of her for it, and later the audience is not supposed to side with Cleao when she makes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive">a careless comment about it</a>. And <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Stephanie herself</span> is portrayed as a normal and kind person who deserves respect and affection like anyone else, and the cast treats her with true affection.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DirtyPair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DirtyPair">Dirty Pair</a></em> had an episode with a sympathetic depiction of a trans woman during a time when most anime wouldn't even touch the subject, except as a source of comedy. What's more, Kei and Yuri actually shout down the bigot who has a problem with her, arguing that there's nothing abnormal about transgender people.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GenmaWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GenmaWars">Genma Wars</a></em> (the '80s film, not the TV series) had a diverse cast consisting of men and women from various countries and ethnic groups, and a message about how people from all walks of life need to get along and work together to make the world a better place. Atypical for a lot of anime of the time, there's even a plot point about one of the heroines, Luna, needing to confront and overcome her racism towards black people.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CandyCandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CandyCandy">Candy Candy</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shoujo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shoujo">Shoujo</a> manga from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> that spreads two very important messages: "women can be anything they want to be in their lives if they work hard on making their hopes and dreams come true" and "romantic love is important in a woman's life, but <em>not</em> necessarily the be all and end all of it."

<ul><li> The indigenous peoples of Karin Island are depicted as completely ordinary, their culture and beliefs are not depicted as inferior or freakish, and when one of the main characters unwittingly calls them savages, the show portrays said comment as a deeply offensive insult. This type of portrayal is rare even in Western media, where Indigenous nations still suffer from harmful stereotypes.
</li><li> Cancer is a complete aversion of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EthnicScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EthnicScrappy">Ethnic Scrappy</a> trope that befalls the majority of characters who are Chinese in Japanese media. He is portrayed incredibly sympathetically, actually has a powerful character arc, and ultimately becomes heroic. Given how heavily Japanese media portrays fictional Chinese characters as villains or as jokes, Cancer is very progressive.
</li><li> A major theme is turning on a superior because the superior is doing something incredibly wrong. In Japan, strict obedience is seen as normal, and any form of treason is a disgrace. It already was a deeply progressive message, but in an age where there is an increasing willingness to vote for a party candidate no matter who they are or what they did simply because the other option is from another party, this message is deeply relevant.

But nope! This was written in <strong>1999</strong>, just 19 years after autism was first added to the DSM and only five years after the APA first started recognizing how broad the autism spectrum actually ran. Not only does it treat its subject well, but it also addresses (and berates) common Japanese stereotypes related to autism, such as the Japanese's words' meaning.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1pz8m');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1pz8m" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1pz8m');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They literally mean "self-closure syndrome", giving a false impression that it's the victim's fault or the mother's fault if someone is autistic.</span> This manga's messages become more and more relevant with each passing year, especially now that the majority of autistic people are becoming adults who may very well need support in a world that feels they either need to be fixed/murdered or that they're incapable of anything.

Nowadays, it's popular to interpret the character as transgender—despite the fact that the manga presents a very stereotypical portrayal of masculine and feminine interests.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SerialExperimentsLain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SerialExperimentsLain">Serial Experiments Lain</a></em> first aired in 1998, at a time when the internet had only been widely used for about three years. Its main message, that the world of the internet has just as much impact as the real world but that the latter should never be forgotten, has only become increasingly important in an age of constant connection, social media, and virtual reality.

Despite the series' sometimes questionable portrayal of LGBT people (most men who show interest in other men are depicted as pedophiles and sex traffickers), the largely sexless romance between main characters Ash and Eiji is praised for being ahead of its time, with their relationship being deeply significant for people who have gone through sexual trauma, and for people who identify as asexual in any way.

Alan discovers that the man who convinced the hospital to have such racist and antisemitic rules is a racketeer who has been convincing institutions across the city to enact similar codes as part of a money-making scheme. When Alan catches the racketeer, he angrily tells him that he's perverted the concept of patriotism and used it as an excuse for racism, all so he could line his pockets. To drive this home, he then reveals that the men who helped him track down the crook were Mike Reilly (an Irishman), Abraham Lincoln Jackson (a black man), Wun Lee (a Chinese man) and Sammy Cohen (a Jew), feeding into Alan's point about America being a land for <em>everyone</em>, not just white Christians.

<div class="indent"><strong>Lindsay:</strong> It's still a cut above what people give it credit for and I think it would be more appreciated if it came out today. Because we need stories like this today.

Maybe this movie wasn't really appreciated in its time because it didn't resonate as much in 1996, but it does resonate more in 2017.

It seemed oddly pessimistic for its viewers at the time, but as the American government becomes more and more transparent, and more corruption scandals leak out with each passing year since Watergate (which wouldn't happen for another three decades), this film has reflected closer and closer to how Americans largely see Congress. Approval ratings for Congress are lower than ever now, and bipartisan faith in the U.S. president has plunged dramatically in the past two decades.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadchenInUniform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadchenInUniform">Mädchen in Uniform</a></em> was the first movie to have a pro-lesbian storyline (and the two females are explicitly in love). Not only that, but neither one dies (one attempts suicide, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterruptedSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterruptedSuicide">but is stopped by her classmates</a>) or turns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian">Psycho Lesbian</a>.

Yet it later became popularized as a critique of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The War on Terror</a>, due to the many parallels between several parts of the movie—governments using acts of terror to justify war, sending countless people to their deaths, employing torture, etc. People who watch it today are even surprised that this film was actually produced half a decade before the Iraq war.

Of particular note is an outright mention of "same-sex marriage": not only was this a revolutionary concept at the time, but the very terminology was rare compared to the much blunter phrase "gay marriage."

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Network" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Network">Network</a></em> was intended to be an over-the-top satire of the news media when it was produced, but as time has passed the film seems less and less outlandish thanks to the rise of partisan media in the 90s and the hyperpolarization that happened in the next two decades.
</li><li> The concerns of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeingThere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeingThere">Being There</a></em> with style being elevated over substance seem more relevant every year.

It was released in 1998, long before the current debate on campus rape, toxic masculinity and athlete entitlement, or support for fourth-wave feminism that addressed it, was anywhere close to the mainstream.

The message is one that has continued to endure, as films such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StopLoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StopLoss">Stop-Loss</a></em> demonstrate.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WarGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WarGames">WarGames</a></em> was released in 1983, when personal computers were still new, and networking them was a decade away. Even though the subject of nuclear war isn't as relevant as it was during the Cold War (and to be fair the dangers of all-out nuclear war are so well-worn the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">relevant aesop</a> enters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObviousAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObviousAesop">Captain Obvious Aesop</a> territory), the dangers presented by computer security threats are even more pertinent to the present than they were in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> now that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsOnline">Everything Is Online</a> and talk of cyber-warfare abounds, and many of the basic security mistakes featured (such as putting a list of passwords on a sheet of paper right next to the computer) are sadly still with us today, too<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2eymb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2eymb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2eymb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">although the specific example of the list of passwords right next to the computer is something modern security thinking acknowledges can be the <em>least</em> bad option, as it allows you to have passwords that are fairly secure (random combinations of letters and words) without incentivizing the people supposed to actually <em>use</em> the computer to write them down and carry it with them. If a hacker is physically next to the computer they have other options in any case.</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NowVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NowVoyager">Now, Voyager</a></em> is very ahead of its time in its treatment of mental illness. Charlotte's mother believes her nervous breakdown is "all nonsense" that she needs to snap out of. Even after Charlotte has gone through counseling and therapy (and given herself a glamorous makeover) her life problems are not automatically solved - and she needs to work hard to properly take control of her life. The film is also very feminist, as Charlotte chooses <em>not</em> to get married because she doesn't love her fiancee - even if they would be a smart match - and she instead devotes her time to taking care of a young girl who's similarly dysfunctional, using her own experiences to help. The film ends with the implication that she'll use her family's wealth to help more people struggling with mental illness.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EducatingRita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EducatingRita">Educating Rita</a></em> subverts the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">Stay in the Kitchen</a> mentality of Rita's husband and family, who expect her to have a baby by the age of twenty-six. When they disapprove of her desire to improve her life through education, she leaves her husband and starts her life over. Wanting to improve your life despite others around you trying to prevent it is a story that has endured well over time. Julie Walters said that for years other women came up to her and said the film inspired them to change their lives too.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChristmasInConnecticut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChristmasInConnecticut">Christmas in Connecticut</a></em>: This 1940s romantic comedy has a plot that could easily be written today. After it's revealed that a Martha Stewart-type magazine writer is a fraud who can't cook and is terrible at being a typical housewife, she ends up re-hired as a writer at double her original salary and gets engaged to a man who's perfectly happy to be the one more interested in child-rearing and housework.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Videodrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Videodrome">Videodrome</a></em>: Although the movie takes it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroughTheEyesOfMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroughTheEyesOfMadness">acid-trip</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a> levels and applied to television, its prediction that people would primarily contact each other through video screen machines, adopt "strange new names" (i.e. online avatars), and become increasingly intertwined with a virtual world has become more relevant with the prevalent role of the internet in everyday life. Even the satirical element of having unscrupulous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> trying to control it to advance their own ideology has become strangely prophetic in light of the attacks on Internet Free Speech and FCC's repeal of net neutrality.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmazonWomenOnTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmazonWomenOnTheMoon">Amazon Women on the Moon</a></em> and their "Dial a Date" sketch. Arquette's character has a machine in her home that allows her to dial up all kinds of ugly dirt on her prospective date. While the fax-line interface and printouts are <em>very</em> 80s, the idea that your date can and will dig up all kinds of dirt (substantiated or not) via social media and potentially weaponize said information is definitely relevant.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Heathers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Heathers">Heathers</a></em> is a particularly chilling example of this, as teen bullying, mass shootings, and suicide have only gained more prominence since the late 1980s. When the film first came out, it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice">Crosses the Line Twice</a> because of course, it was absurd that white, middle-class teenagers would want to slaughter their classmates. Now, however, it just crosses the line, to the point that a TV show based on the movie was repeatedly delayed and eventually dropped entirely. With two of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history happening within three months of each other in 2018, and these types of tragedies happening practically every week, it's <em>always</em> insensitive.
<ul><li> Heathers also brings up rape culture in a way that was very unusual for the 80's, with Kurt and Ram unambiguously being portrayed as assholes for spreading a rumor about Veronica giving them oral sex and sexually assaulting Heather McNamara and it is not played for a joke. Heather Chandler is also being shown being pressured into giving a college guy oral sex and later is seen washing her mouth out with a traumatized expression on her face, later lashing out at Veronica who managed to resist the peer pressure to do so, implying that some of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> tendencies are a cover for all she's sacrificed in the name of appearing popular and cool. J.D also slips a couple of notches down the villain scale when Veronica tries to break up with him and he shoves her back down on the sofa and plants a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcefulKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcefulKiss">Forceful Kiss</a> on her, though fortunately he doesn't go further once Veronica tells him to get lost.
</li><li> The movie also goes out of its way to show that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChainOfHarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChainOfHarm">getting rid of one bad person doesn't solve anything in the long run and that a victim can turn into a bully easily</a>, as when Heather Chandler dies, Heather Duke promptly takes her place and starts bullying Heather McNamara in exactly the same way, much to the frustration of Veronica. When J.D suggests killing off Heather Duke as well, Veronica points out that killing Chandler just made her into a martyr and they can't go around murdering whoever they feel like, but J.D doesn't listen to her. This becomes all the more relevant in the New 10's with school bullying coming under much sharper focus.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DaughterOfShanghai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DaughterOfShanghai">Daughter of Shanghai</a></em> is a B-movie from the 30s that had Asian leads who averted any stereotyping, were able to be the heroes of the piece and the man and woman were shown to be equally competent. It was selected for preservation in the Library of Congress for this reason — and star <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnnaMayWong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnnaMayWong">Anna May Wong</a> listed it as her favorite role.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FlowerDrumSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FlowerDrumSong">Flower Drum Song</a></em> was notable for having an all Asian cast of characters who averted most stereotypes and were played by Asian actors. The film toned down the patronizing aspects of the stage show and focused on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureClash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureClash">Culture Clash</a> in San Francisco between Chinese natives and second-generation young people. The themes of trying to move with the times and still upholding traditions of your culture are very relevant.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BornInEastLA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BornInEastLA">Born in East L.A.</a></em> is a largely forgotten Cheech Marin comedy about an American-born man of Mexican heritage who is mistakenly deported to Mexico, a country he's never known. With immigration becoming a major political football since the presidential candidacy of Donald Trump, the themes of race, citizenship and forced deportation of Mexican-Americans has never been more relevant.
</li><li> One reason the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> Prequel Trilogy films, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace">The Phantom Menace</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones">Attack of the Clones</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em> were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">Vindicated by History</a> during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a> was that by that time, the trilogy's themes of the decline of democracy and the toxic influence of wealth in politics had become more relevant than before. When <em>The Phantom Menace</em> was released in 1999, people thought a trade war started by a Trade Federation was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyReasonForWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyReasonForWar">preposterous</a>, but with subsequent events like the "Citizens United" Supreme Court case, which ruled that "corporations are people" and equated money with free speech, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">the War in Iraq</a> suspected of being driven by the desires of obtaining Iraq's oil supply, it didn't seem so outrageous anymore.

Reg dismisses this, since Loreta doesn't even have a womb... but then at the end of the movie, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">everybody casually calls her Loreta</a>. This was a funny joke in 1979, but 40 years later, it comes across as a more sympathetic portrayal of transgenderism.

<ul><li> The film combats the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotLikeOtherGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotLikeOtherGirls">Not Like Other Girls</a> trope in a refreshing way. Gracie starts out initially being scornful of the pageant contestants, but as she gets to know them she becomes good friends with several of them and gains a lot of respect for both the girls and herself in the process, as by the end of the movie she's still a badass FBI agent and considerably more well-groomed and refined, showing that you can be both and they are not mutually exclusive.
</li><li> The movie also brings up rape culture when a drunk Cheryl rather nonchalantly admits her college professor sexually assaulted her. When a horrified Grace asks if she reported him, Cheryl says she didn't and then adds, "I know that happens all the time!" Grace tells Cheryl in no uncertain terms that it does not, that she should always report such things and then decides to try and teach Cheryl how to defend herself (though Cheryl passes out before she can get far), but Grace doesn't ever blame Cheryl for the incident or shame her for not telling anyone sooner, and Grace is inspired to use her training to do some impromptu self-defense lessons during the talent portion of the competition, so many young girls watching the show will see it and have something to fall back on.

To wit: the killer, who harasses the girls over the phone before he comes to kill them, is basically a woman-hating internet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Troll</a> before the internet. This harassment isn't taken seriously until it's too late, the film not-so-subtly blaming the community for allowing it to reach that point and fester within their midst (the famous line "the calls are coming from inside the house" can just as easily be seen as metaphorical). Finally, its portrayal of its sorority sister protagonists is quite sex-positive, especially by the standards of the time and the genre, including having the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalGirl">Final Girl</a> not only be sexually active, but planning to get an abortion despite the wishes of her boyfriend.

The murder of a black man during a traffic stop drives the plot. In modern times, issues with police militarization, violence and racism have all become even greater causes for concern, with fatal encounters between black men and police receiving significant coverage and controversy.

All of which still affect millions of Latino immigrants today, especially in the 2010's when the U.S. federal government doubled down on enforcing immigration protocols to the letter.

She then is forced to become her rapist's mistress in order to survive. This was presented as a tragedy—with the heroine being innocent—and controversial in the time it was written, while nowadays most people would agree that <em>of course</em> Tess is not to be blamed for the rape, and that the double-standard her husband (who lost his virginity in consensual sex) uses to justify his leaving her is despicable. The message against victim-blaming is still an anvil that needs to be dropped, sadly, even though attitudes on virginity have relaxed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables">Les Misérables</a></em> is sadly resonant with society today, seeing men persecuted simply for their past reputation, families dividing over petty issues as political fanaticism, officials emphasizing rules over care and consideration, and scoundrels abusing their position of 'caretaker' simply for the money. Victor Hugo's urging that these ills <em>must</em> be faced is every bit as relevant today as they were in post-Revolutionary France. This is acknowledged by Upton Sinclair in his preface to the novel: "...so long as ignorance and misery remain on earth, books like this cannot be useless."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UncleTomsCabin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UncleTomsCabin">Uncle Tom's Cabin</a></em>, particularly the ideas of passive resistance and racial equality. It wasnt until after the Civil Rights Era that Harriet Beecher Stowe was fully vindicated as being on the right side of history.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> story "The Adventure of the Yellow Face": The sympathetic treatment of interracial marriage, which in its time was (consciously) controversial, now comes across as proper and endearing; so much so that readers who aren't aware of historical prejudices could find the plot, which revolves around an attempt to conceal said interracial marriage, confusing and unnecessary.
<ul><li> Overall the original Sherlock Holmes stories are either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay">Fair for Its Day</a> or this trope when it comes to race or gender. The Ku Klux Klan makes an appearance as a deadly effective but unsympathetic terrorist organization— which it was for most of its existence but was not universally perceived as such until long after its demise. Even the portrayal of Sherlock bears mention, as he is a relatively well-written, if very high-functioning, autistic savant <em>avant la lettre</em> (if you had to diagnose him with modern terms), whose depiction is especially notable for the fact that he is shown to be capable of living a fulfilling independent life and is <strong>not</strong> utterly helpless outside of his specialized strengths. Small wonder that when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">the 2010 series</a> was airing, it amassed a large number of autistic fans who identified with Sherlock.
</li><li> One of the key motivations behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkGatiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkGatiss">Mark Gatiss</a>' revamping of the character when creating <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em> was their realization that Dr. Watson's backstory as a wounded and invalided veteran of a British military campaign in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Afghanistan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> was, in light of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The War on Terror</a>, just as relevant at the beginning of the twenty-first century as it had been at the end of the nineteenth when the stories were first being written.
</li><li> Sherlock Holmes is what would be known today as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Asexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Asexual">asexual</a>/aromantic, as his total lack of romantic/sexual interest is consistently presented; while this was probably written into his character to emphasize how dedicated he is to logical pursuits, he's also never accused of or implied to be sociopathic or otherwise mentally ill, and aside from one dehumanizing "he's like a machine" comment from Watson, Holmes' staunch bachelorhood is neither made fun of, nor is it treated as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">saintly, unattainable ideal</a>. This was in an era and place were people were generally expected to get married, as marriage was an important part of forging connections, cementing your place in the social ladder, and producing heirs for any fortune you might have. He's just a human who is accepted for who he is. Original ACD Holmes, that is— most adaptations tend to ignore or overlook this (though to be fair, this is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> in it of itself, as until fairly recently asexuality wasnt too well known as an actual orientation, with most characters such as Holmes being perceived as simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero">Chaste Heroes</a>). The 1984-1994 Granada <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> largely follows the ACD portrayal (including the glimpses of Holmes' empathy that are often downplayed in modern interpretations like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em>), as does the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_BBC_Radio_Sherlock_Holmes_dramatisations">BBC radio series<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> starring Clive Merrison that was broadcast throughout the 1990s and 2000s - though it is also possible to interpret some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> in Holmes and Watsons relationship as well.
</li><li> There's also a lesser-known non-Holmes mystery short story by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurConanDoyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurConanDoyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a> with the title <em>The Man with the Watches</em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.arthur-conan-doyle.com/index.php/The_Story_of_the_Man_with_Watches">[1]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which is remarkably gay-positive or at least advocating for tolerance. Alright, the narrator is a homomisiac/transmisiac jerk, the story still ends in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays">tragedy</a>, and the gay couple are criminals (card sharps) willing to use violence, but the narrative supports the reading that the tragedy wouldn't have happened if the narrator hadn't been such a bigoted bully, and the surviving partner of the pair (who'd been presented as a "seducer of the innocent" by the narrator up to that point) is explicitly shown to not be evil or inhuman. And for a mainstream author in the Victorian era, writing this story for the family-friendly, middle-class <em>The Strand</em> magazine, a story that not only shows the "love that dare not speak its name" in fairly unmistakable ways <em>at all</em>, but also invites the reader to sympathize with the gay characters, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay">pretty amazing</a> already. Basically, the whole thing wouldn't feel out of place as an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RipperStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RipperStreet">Ripper Street</a></em>, which combines modern social sensibilities with sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">pretty bigoted protagonists</a>. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3w6tv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3w6tv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3w6tv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Sadly, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays">Bury Your Gays</a> trope is also still alive and well in modern mainstream media.</span>
</li></ul><div class="indent"> At the bottom I struck my head against a stone, and I remembered nothing more. When I came to myself I was lying among some low bushes, not far from the railroad track, and somebody was bathing my head with a wet handkerchief. It was Sparrow MacCoy.

As income inequality continues to widen in many parts of the world, these themes remain just as relevant as ever.
<ul><li> A Christmas Carol is also an interesting case in that it helped in creating its own Values Resonance; the wholesome, family and generosity-centric Christmas it presents actually wasnt the mainstream way Christmas was celebrated at the time, until that point being mostly a strictly religious holiday or an excuse for adults to get drunk. While forcing workers to work on Christmas may be presented as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a> moment among a long string of them from Scrooge, at the time it would have been fairly common. Exploitative bosses forcing their employees to work even on holidays is probably something that still resonates with many people, especially those in retail.

Its general <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">War Is Hell</a> message works particularly well with the anti-military values transmitted by the German education system ever since the end of World War 2. Also, it teaches teenagers not to blindly follow authority, especially not jingoistic adults who tell them that it's "glorious" to fight and die for one's country.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour">Nineteen Eighty Four</a></em> was thankfully not an accurate prediction of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>. Yet its message of extreme surveillance became even more prevalent in the following years, particularly once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The War on Terror</a> led to a bump in government-endorsed CCTV and wiretaps.

A similar event occurred after Donald Trump got elected president, mostly due to the "alternative facts" flap.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BraveNewWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BraveNewWorld">Brave New World</a></em> (1931) still manages to resonate. Some have argued that it's actually more relevant today than it was in its time, as people seem increasingly willing to give up their rights in the name of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadAndCircuses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadAndCircuses">immediate pleasure and entertainment</a>. It also predicted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">greater drug use and looser sexual mores</a>, though in the book this went <em>much</em> further than reality.

The book's plot imagines a world where people have become so averse to complex thought and discomfort that they have censored all books to avoid offense and spend all their time fixated on insipid entertainment. This has become even more relevant today, with the propagation of "outrage culture" policing what people can and cannot say to avoid causing offense, as well as the rise of simplified and bite-sized avenues of expression through social media. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Fahrenheit4512018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Fahrenheit4512018">2018 film adaptation</a> updates the setting to highlight social media and emojis, showcasing the continuing relevance of the story.

</li><li> The sentiments of Siegfried Sassoon's poem "Aftermath" resonate just as strongly today as they did immediately following World War I, perhaps even more so given all that's happened since it was written in 1920. This is, in fact, true of many of the anti-war poems that came out of the First World War.
</li><li> The E.M.

Aside from updating the dialogue and characters to fit the setting, nothing else had to be changed. That film? The teen comedy classic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clueless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clueless">Clueless</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Another Jane Austen classic, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice">Pride and Prejudice</a></em>, aside from its perpetually relevant moral of not prejudging others or thinking too highly of yourself because of your status, showcases the perils of marrying for convenience or looks and elevates the notion of marrying for love, an ideal that would have been considered rather quixotic at the time. Many of its characters will also be eerily familiar to modern readers, both in real life and in contemporary fiction: Mrs. Bennet, the crass gossip and social climber; Mr. Bennet, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulWeddedLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulWeddedLife">the distant husband who openly mocks his wife</a> and daughters for kicks; Lydia, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyTeenageDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyTeenageDaughter">the bratty, reckless teenager</a> who sees nothing wrong with her irresponsible behaviour and ultimately ends up screwing up her own life; Jane, who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">so nice and self-effacing that she endangers her own happiness</a>; Wickham, who fools everyone with his charm but is in fact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">a mid-functioning sociopath</a>; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">Caroline</a> and Lady Catherine, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Rich Bitches</a>; and of course, Elizabeth, the intelligent, perceptive, quick-witted protagonist with a playfully snarky sense of humor. The characters resonant enough today that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheLizzieBennetDiaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheLizzieBennetDiaries">a modern-day adaptation in the form of a video blog</a>, which for the most part did not change the main characters' personalities and struggles, was <em>frequently</em> thought to be <em>a real video blog</em> by many first-time viewers (apparently fewer people have read <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> than one would like to think).
</li><li> <em>By the Waters of Babylon</em> by Stephen Vincent Benét is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">post-apocalyptic</a> short story about a primitive man exploring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuinsOfTheModernAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuinsOfTheModernAge">Ruins of the Modern Age</a>. Despite being written in 1937, it might well have been an archetypal post-nuclear story from the 1950s or 1960s.
</li><li> Similarly, there's the short poem <em>There Will Come Soft Rains</em> by Sara Teasdale which considering its topic of humanity's self-destruction through apocalyptic war and its Gaia-theory-like environmental sensibilities seems like it could have been written in the 1980s or later. In fact, it was published in <em>1918</em> — 25 years before the invention of the nuclear bomb.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note40hxk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note40hxk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note40hxk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Much later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayBradbury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayBradbury">Ray Bradbury</a> based a short story on the poem; and later it was quoted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>.</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAdventuresOfPinocchio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAdventuresOfPinocchio">The Adventures of Pinocchio</a></em>, the children's novel from 1883, has prompted many computer scientists nowadays to see parallels between Pinocchio, a man-made being who wants to become a "real boy", and artificial intelligence, decades before other such media like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IRobot">I, Robot</a>.
</li><li> Judy Blume's book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Blubber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Blubber">Blubber</a></em> is a book about bullying. This was written in 1974. Its grimly realistic outlook and lack of sugarcoating made it the target of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a>, but with an increased focus on the effects of bullying and the growing anti-bullying movement, it's as relevant as ever.
</li><li> In his 1907 novel <em>Le Meraviglie del Duemila</em> ("The Marvels of the Year 2,000"), Emilio Salgari imagined a world in which every country had renounced war due to all of them having access to what are basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">nuclear weapons</a>, anticipating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutuallyAssuredDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutuallyAssuredDestruction">Mutually Assured Destruction</a> and its fear.

</li><li> Vilhelm Moberg's four book suite collectively referred to as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEmigrants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEmigrants">The Emigrants</a></em> is almost more topical today than when it was originally written in the 1940s and 50s. The story is set in the mid-19th century and follows a group of people in Småland, Sweden, who become the first in the parish to emigrate to America. The first book ("<em>The Emigrants</em>") follows the characters until they have landed on American soil and the following three ("<em>The Immigrants</em>", "<em>The Settlers</em>" and "<em>The Last Letter Home</em>") chronicles how they build a new life in their new homeland and stays with the characters until most of them are dead. Among the group of emigrants are Karl Oskar Nilsson, a farmer who can't provide for his family at home and dreams of the vast farm land of North America, and his wife Kristina, who doesn't want to emigrate but agrees after their oldest child dies of starvation. Karl Oskar prospers in the New World but Kristina spends her life plagued by homesickness and never becomes "Americanized" or even learns the language. While the Swedish mass-emigration to the US isn't exactly an ongoing thing, the core of the story is very, <em>very</em> topical as of this post being written in 2015. The number of refugees worldwide today from impoverished third world countries, the debates on whether or not they should be allowed to enter the countries they flee towards, and the growing anti-immigrant sentiment on the right and pro-immigrant on the left, makes the story feel very modern and relevant. The characters in the novel are all so well-written and fleshed out and their various hardships so relatable that even though they are 19th-century peasants from Protestant Sweden they can easily be recognized in people of all origins and faiths in modern times. In particular, their voyage across the ocean in the first book is almost uncomfortable to read about (and watching it in the movie) today when there are so many people still risking their lives on the seas to escape to a better life. Sweden itself is today oftentimes hailed as a land of milk and honey in the countries that see a lot of its citizens fleeing there, which comes off as ironic as the character Robert constantly hails America that same way in the first two novels.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSecretGarden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSecretGarden">The Secret Garden</a></em>:
<ul><li> The book is written in the early 1900s but contains a rather progressive attitude towards classism and racism. Mary displays racism towards her servants in India and even gets violent with them if they don't do her bidding - and it's used to show her as a brat. Martha likewise calls Mary out for her anger at Martha assuming she'd be "a native". And it's illustrated that bringing such a young girl up to think she's inherently superior to everyone around her - just because of her birth status - is what made Mary so dysfunctional in the first place.
</li><li> The book criticizes the hell out of neglectful parenting too. Mary's parents were distant and just foisted her into the care of various servants, which is what led to her becoming so cold and sour, to begin with. It also shows that non-malicious neglect can still be damaging; Colin's father doesn't neglect him out of laziness or cruelty - he's just broken by his wife's death. But the story goes out of its way to show that children need love and care from their parents. This is from an era where upper-class children were handed off to nannies and governesses, treated more like heirs to hand the property over to than actual human beings.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWorldAccordingToGarp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWorldAccordingToGarp">The World According to Garp</a></em> contains an early transgender character, Roberta Muldoon, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> makes a highly publicized transition from a professional football player to an activist for women's rights. The character is treated in a surprisingly serious manner, in that she's rarely played for laughs (or at least no more so than the rest of the cast) and is one of the few characters who come across as consistently kind, generous, and level-headed (she experiences deep regret <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that she did not take the bullet that killed Jenny Fields</span> and later serves as an affectionate substitute mother for the Garp children <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after their own parents die</span>). There is a particularly touching scene <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after Roberta's death</span> in which televised sportscasters make a point of honoring her life's work by not misgendering her.
</li><li> Although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain">Mark Twain</a>'s anti-religious works may look very old-fashioned or even strange from the point of view of modern readers when the church has much less power and influence over Western countries, his other works are still surprisingly perceptive. In particular, although formally colonialism is already in the past, the idea that large states do not have the right to manipulate or dictate their will to weaker countries only on the basis of the law of force remains relevant even now, especially in the context of geopolitics.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy">The Divine Comedy</a></em>:
<ul><li> Even after seven centuries that saw Christian society change radically, <em>The Divine Comedy</em> continues to be admired throughout the Church for its genius portrayal of a life that begins in sin and misery, strives to do better, and ultimately finds rest in Love. It is difficult to find a better endorsement for an author than to have the Pope call you a "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2015/05/05/pope-francis-suggests-divine-comedy-as-vital-reading-for-year-of-mercy/">prophet of hope<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" when your poem sets a few Popes on fire.
</li><li> Although he affirms his respect for the Papacy and the Church's authority, Dante spares no venom when cutting down the corruption in the priesthood and religious orders, and has no problem using the Saints as mouthpieces for the sake of this condemnation. Hearing this from the greatest Catholic poet of all time earned the work special appreciation from the Protestants who sought to reform the Church and those struggling with faith in the wake of the clergy sex abuse scandal.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ACanticleForLeibowitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ACanticleForLeibowitz">A Canticle for Leibowitz</a></em> revolves around the efforts of a post-apocalyptic abbey of monks to preserve the wisdom and literature of the pre-war world for posterity in the wake of a backlash against intellectuals known as the 'simplification'. In some places in the world today, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/a-priest-has-found-a-unique-method-of-combatting-isis-2016-1/">the Catholic clergy are still doing this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnnieOnMyMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnnieOnMyMind">Annie on My Mind</a></em> is a book about two high school girls who are lesbians and fall in love, with a heavy emphasis on pro-acceptance. This kind of book featuring gay characters is pretty common these days, but remember, this was published in 1982, just after the AIDS crisis began and homophobia was incredibly rampant. Some people even burned the book in public for daring to have sympathetic lesbian characters who got a happy ending, and weren't cured, made villains, or killed. It helps that the author was a lesbian who had difficulty accepting herself and being accepted by others and wrote the book based on her own experiences. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayAesop">Gay Aesop</a> is one certain people still can't get through their heads <em>today</em>, but it's messages are just as important now as they were in the 80s.
</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a>'s <em>Out of the Aeons</em> is a shining example of his notoriously antiquated racial politics (to such an over-the-top degree that it's hard to take seriously even in light of modern America's escalating race war) one thing that does ring truer than ever today is that it also showcases Lovecraft's utter disgust towards sensationalistic tabloid journalism and the kind of people who are attracted to it.

</li><li> <em>The Sheep Look Up</em>, written in 1972 and set in unspecified future, deals with environmental problems, famine in underdeveloped countries, lack of corporate responsibility—as well as the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. All still valid concerns today.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHandmaidsTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHandmaidsTale">The Handmaid's Tale</a></em>, originally written in 1985, fell into this following the release of the 2017 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHandmaidsTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHandmaidsTale">television series</a>. Much of the book's themes of sexism and religion creeping into politics seem just as relevant today as they did 30 years ago. Handmaids became a staple of left-wing protests nowadays, especially those dealing with women's rights (particularly abortion).
</li><li> In its protrayal of a young woman trying (and failing) to handle misbehaving children who are being ignored by their wealthy parents, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AgnesGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AgnesGrey">Agnes Grey</a></em> feels resonant with the difficulities that modern teachers and childcare employees have to go through.

<ul><li> "The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street" is a classic episode about aliens who use good old-fashioned human prejudice and hysteria while they just watch and laugh. This was an allegory for the Red Scare, warning how communism is a danger, but the self-destructive anti-communist hysteria among the American people at the time was actually the best way for the real communists to <em>win</em>. The episode was remade for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTwilightZone2002" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTwilightZone2002">The Twilight Zone (2002)</a></em>, with the communist threat changed to terrorism. No other changes were made... or needed.
</li><li> "He's Alive" is another good contender, on how we keep monsters like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> alive so long as we spread intolerance, no matter of what kind.
</li><li> "Number 12 Looks Just Like You" and its theme of over conformity and the Hollywood obsession with beauty (especially female beauty) is probably even truer today than it was back then. Eerily, it takes place in the year 2000.
</li><li> "Eye of the Beholder" has similar themes. The Closing Narration even invokes this:
</li></ul><div class="indent">Now the questions that come to mind: Where is this place and when is it? What kind of world, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ugliness is the norm and beauty the deviation from that norm?</span> You want an answer? The answer is...it doesn't make any difference. Because the old saying happens to be true. Beauty is in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">eye of the beholder.</a> In this year or a hundred years hence. On this planet... or wherever there is human life, perhaps out amongst the stars. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Lesson to be learned... in The Twilight Zone.
</div><ul><li> "Night of the Meek" (the Christmas episode) is basically a big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop">Aesop</a> about belief and the goodness of charity and giving as opposed to blindly and selfishly asking and receiving. Its message is even truer today, as the commercialization of the holidays is greater than ever.
</li><li> "The Shelter" is a good example, whose message is somewhat similar to 'The Monsters Are Due On Maple Street', showing how when people turn on each other in times of crisis, it only leads to destruction. Incidentally, "The Shelter" is one of only a few episodes that keeps a fully realistic setting (no science fiction or supernatural elements), driving the point home that much harder due to the fact that it comes off as something that could actually happen in real life.
</li><li> Thanks to theories on global climate change that are increasingly agreed to be true, the depiction of people going mad and dying from extreme heat in "The Midnight Sun" is far more unsettling today. And that's an episode that wasn't intended to be a moral lesson at all!

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> has managed to come up with many stories that are excellent examples of this trope.

The Doctor observes that to follow the zombie's plan would ultimately just destroy him and his world, but he's accused of lying. There's no way this was intentional considering the episode's release in 1976; the actual <em>Who</em> Brexit allegory story (the Monks trilogy) is somewhat less on-the-nose.
</li><li> The 1978 story "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS15E4TheSunmakers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS15E4TheSunmakers">The Sunmakers</a>" combines this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a>. In 1978 it was a right-wing allegory about how taxation is evil, but in the late 00s and 10s, it's a left-wing Occupy allegory about how forcing the tax burden on the poor to benefit big corporations is evil. Complete with a gas that makes everyone afraid of being pumped into everyone's houses - an allegory for news media, which has become much more omnipresent and sensationalist since 1978.

The O.B.I.T. machine turns out to have been invented by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">alien invaders</a> who are using it to demoralize humanity, thus making it easier for them to take over. For a story written decades before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The War on Terror</a> and the resulting surveillance state, the episode is eerily prescient.
</li><li> It's surprising how relevant some of the political issues explored on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesMinister">Yes, Minister</a></em> (though by no means all) still hold true in later decades. For example, one episode deals with upgrading the British nuclear deterrent to Trident, over time the issue has been replacing Trident; despite being set in the Cold War, it's portrayed as just as ridiculously pointless as many think it to be now. Other issues including government waste, data-gathering and privacy concerns, Britain's place in Europe... The episode where Hacker becomes Prime Minister, partially through twisting truth about a new EU directive and then claiming a great victory over Brussels, can even seem like an allegory for Boris Johnson, who is widely believed to have supported Brexit so he could become PM. He and Hacker even both have an obsession with portraying themselves as Churchill.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MisterRogersNeighborhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MisterRogersNeighborhood">Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</a></em> has one great example from its <em>very first episode</em>. In the land of make-believe, King Friday XIII built a wall to keep out any outsiders and keep things from ever-changing (he is talked into taking it down, however). Sound similar to a policy that United States Republicans have been advocating for years now? Also, at least <a class="urllink" href="https://qz.com/942781/lost-episodes-of-mr-rogers-about-the-cold-war-have-emerged-on-youtube/">one site<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> drew parallels between the conflict in the Conflict Week episodes and Donald Trump's brinkmanship policy. Really it's probably safe to say that Fred Rogers embodied a lot of values that resonate even more strongly today, and why Mr. Rogers signs have appeared at protests since Trump became president.
</li><li> While the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS1E8IRobotYouJane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS1E8IRobotYouJane">I Robot, You Jane</a>" is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">clearly made in the late nineties</a> and occasionally veers into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil">New Media Are Evil</a> territory, the basic message of the episode - about being careful online, as people aren't always who they say they are - is more relevant now in an era when every teenager spends most of their time online, than it was when it aired back in 1997, when the internet was still a fringe interest and social media wasn't really a thing.

</div></li><li> Swedish singer Karl Gerhard wrote the song "Nu ska vi vara snälla" ("Let's be nice now") in the 1930s. One verse is about how Sweden has a minister of defense, but no actual defense, since what military it does have is constantly being reduced and downsized. Karl Gerhard's suggested solution to this is that when the enemy planes arrive in Sweden, all the Swedes will simply hide, so the enemy won't have anybody to fight. Now, over seventy years later, it's safe to say that the observation about the state of the military, as well as the suggested solution, is as relevant as ever.
</li><li> "I'm Afraid of Americans" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a> is one big sardonic call-out towards the prevalence of gun violence, poverty, and overall degeneracy in American society.

Jackson's message of "why can't we all just get along" is a question that many of these people have been asking, with many agreeing that "Black or White" is especially necessary nowadays.
</li><li> The song "Spaceman" by Babylon Zoo features lyrics condemning "the sickening taste" of "homophobic jokes" and "images of fascist votes", lyrics that, while nowhere near as bad as back then, do continue to ring true today.
</li></ul><ul><li> A lot of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopPunk">Pop Punk</a> from the late 1970s onwards sounds more contemporary than one might think. There are rock songs from 1978 that for many listeners could pass for songs from 2008. (Try playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ramones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ramones">Ramones</a>' "Blitzkrieg Bop" or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Buzzcocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Buzzcocks">Buzzcocks</a>' "Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn't've)" for a group of 14-year-olds sometime and kidding them that it's a "new" song; odds are at least one person will believe you.) It certainly helps that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeChordsAndTheTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeChordsAndTheTruth">the style of and philosophy behind those earlier hits</a> has made a major comeback in the 21st century.

</li><li> "Media Overkill" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Scorpions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Scorpions">Scorpions</a> is about media manipulating people with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuridTalesOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuridTalesOfDoom">lurid stories</a>, which is just as if not even more relevant today.
<ul><li> Also "Wind of Change", which was originally written about the end of the Soviet Union and being hopeful for the future, is now pretty relevant again with North and South Korea having a historic summit and finally putting an end to the Korean war after over 70 years.

Likewise, the message that the world is going to get tough while you're trying to work your way up resonates even more with the current generation of aspiring artists and creatives.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a>'s "Scandal" A searing assault on sensationalist tabloid media is just as relevant (and arguably more) today as the press continues to sell sensational sleaze.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RedRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RedRider">Red Rider</a>'s 1981 single "Lunatic Fringe" was written as a response to the resurgence of antisemitism that had developed through the 1970s. With the rise of alt-right, nationalist and antisemitic fringe groups in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>, galvanized by increasingly nationalistic right-wing political parties and culminating in the infamous 2017 "<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally">Unite the Right<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the "lunatic fringe" is just as big a concern now as then.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheReplacements" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheReplacements">The Replacements</a>' song Androgynous came out in 1984, and with the defiance of gender roles becoming more mainstream in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>, the rise in people identifying as non-binary, and the subsequent backlash, the song's simple message of love and sympathy to those not conforming to conventional gender roles is more relevant today than it was even at the time.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobSeger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobSeger">Bob Seger</a> song Old Time Rock And Roll was released in 1978 but the song could have easily come out in any year since then when one reminisces "about the days of old with that old time rock and roll".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aerosmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aerosmith">Aerosmith</a>'s "Walk This Way", released in 1975, is a double example. It relates the story of a virgin losing his virginity to a sexually experienced woman, and both the narrator and his partner are treated very well. The woman's experience is treated as a positive, and her enthusiasm helps the narrator along. In turn, the narrator is seen as a fairly well meaning person who only needs a little bit of instruction as opposed to a deficient person for being a virgin. In an era where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming">Slut-Shaming</a> is being questioned more and more, and where a good deal of debate is being had around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginShaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginShaming">Virgin-Shaming</a>, a 45-year-old song feels almost refreshing in its discussion of both ends of that spectrum.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Weezer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Weezer">Weezer</a>'s album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pinkerton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pinkerton">Pinkerton</a></em> deals with themes of loneliness, sexual frustration, isolation, and unsatisfaction with one's life. While the album was first released in 1996, its themes are still relevant today as birthrates and romantic relationships decline and as people argue that social media and the social isolation brought about by the COVID-19 lockdown have made people more unhappy and isolated from one another than ever before.
</li><li> Part of the reason behind "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDarkSideOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDarkSideOfTheMoon">The Dark Side of the Moon</a>"'s public longevity in spite of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock">Progressive Rock</a>'s short mainstream lifespan is that the themes tackled by the album, including job anxiety, mortality, the frailty of mental health, and the ills of war culture and capitalism, have only grown more relevant with each passing decade since it first released in 1973, especially in the 21st century, where the still-ongoing War in Afghanistan, the disastrous Iraq War, the Great Recession, and the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting quarantines all remain fresh in public memory.

<ul><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AntichristSuperstar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AntichristSuperstar">Antichrist Superstar</a>" uses its premise as a metaphor for perceived fascist elements of conservatism. The resurgence of the far-right in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a> shows that the album's themes are still relevant two decades later.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MechanicalAnimals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MechanicalAnimals">Mechanical Animals</a>" focuses on fame and drug use damaging one's life, as well as the media's glorification of such. Death of celebrities (including ex-bandmate Gidget Gein) by overdosing since its release in 1998 still show the album's relevancy.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HolyWoodInTheShadowOfTheValleyOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HolyWoodInTheShadowOfTheValleyOfDeath">Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)</a>" was created as a response to the media falsely accusing the band for influencing the perpetrators of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Columbine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Columbine">Columbine</a>, and criticizes media for capitalizing on mass shootings and scapegoating entertainment for such.

By <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>. For North American audiences, a lot of baggage was added by the use of Africans in larger-scale Atlantic slavery. But generally speaking, the play has a lot that resonates with modern audiences; attitudes to cultural/ethnic minorities, minority attitudes, the troubles of career military men in domestic settings, the destructive power of rumors.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheClouds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheClouds">The Clouds</a></em>, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristophanes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristophanes">Aristophanes</a>, mocks both conservative and left-wing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical">Strawman Political</a> types, with the former being portrayed as not using actual arguments, just saying "this is the way we've always done it" and "Doing it differently will make you gay" and the latter controlling most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Socrates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Socrates">Socrates</a>' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanU">Academy</a> and being able to convince anyone of anything, including that the only reason it isn't acceptable for sons to beat their fathers is that there's a law that says there isn't. Today, gay rights and moral relativism are actually points of debate.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Lysistrata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Lysistrata">Lysistrata</a></em> has an overriding message of peace and, like many Aristophanes' plays, claims war is being prolonged by corrupt politicians. Due to this, the play ended up being performed a lot in the year the Iraq War began. It also has quite a bit to say on feminism and the kind of power women have. Not bad for a play that, even back then, was a raunchy sex comedy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Chicago">Chicago</a></em> (both the stage musical and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chicago">the movie</a>). Its view of the celebrity that comes from scandal seems to be getting more relevant every year. A lot of people took interest in the whole "celebrity defendant" phenomenon after the OJ Simpson trial and the 1996 revival has been running ever since. In fact, the program for one touring production described it as "scandalous in the 20s (when the nonmusical play came out), controversial in the 70s, and now just reads like a documentary".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SpringAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SpringAwakening">Spring Awakening</a></em> (the original play) was written just before the 1900s, but still holds a lot of Values Resonance on cultural/religious repression and sexuality. The musical outright <em>invokes this</em> by using contemporary style/slang for the songs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AwesomeMusic/Theatre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AwesomeMusic/Theatre">And it works.</a> The show is essentially about what happens when you refuse to give teenagers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTalk">The Talk</a>.

Apparently, people in China found it especially relatable after the end of the Cultural Revolution and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReignOfTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReignOfTerror">Reign of Terror</a> created by the Gang of Four.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/InheritTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/InheritTheWind">Inherit the Wind</a></em>: With the rise of the power of the political Religious Right and later the countering rise of the more assertive New Atheism doing battle in the courts like over religious pseudo-sciences like "Intelligent Design," this play's conflict between faith and secularism is still powerfully relevant today.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AStreetcarNamedDesire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AStreetcarNamedDesire">A Streetcar Named Desire</a>:</em> The play symbolizes the struggle between the Old South and New South that was taking place at the time. Blanche was an antebellum <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthernBelle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthernBelle">Southern Belle</a> left over from before the Civil War (being played in the movie by Scarlett O'Hara herself, Vivian Leigh, only added to this,) and Stanley was a more modern, industrial blue-collar immigrant, symbolic of the direction the South was heading, and the clash between those who wanted to go back to the Good Old Days and those who wanted to embrace progress. Important in 1947 since the South was still recovering, but the same Old Guard vs. New Blood debate is showing up all over again, with a younger generation of more diverse, liberal, and progressive Southerners butting heads with the much more religious, staunchly conservative and heavily white previous generation. Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire">the analogy falls apart</a> once you realize that many modern conservatives would sympathize with Stanley more than they would with Blanche.

Pinafore</a></em>: While a lot of the other Victoriana hasn't aged particularly well, the mocking of political appointees with no experience in their field and over-inflated egos (in this case, a First Lord of the Admiralty whose closest connection to the Navy is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">partnership</a> in a law firm), will probably never cease to be funny as long as back-room political dealing and nepotism are a thing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AnInspectorCalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AnInspectorCalls">An Inspector Calls</a></em> tells of a young working-class woman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a> by poverty, and sharply interrogates the culpability of the British upper and middle classes in the desolate lives of the working classes—each member is not to blame individually, but functioning as a class they oppressed and hounded a woman to her death. The play depicts and mercilessly deconstructs the every-man-for-himself individualism of the bourgeoisie as represented by Mr. Birling, with the central Aesop being that all people are connected and that the rich and powerful must take responsibility for the impacts of their actions on others: "If mankind will not learn that lesson, then the time will come soon when he will be taught it, in fire, and blood, and anguish." Written in the 1930s and set in 1912, and still extremely resonant in Conservative-governed Britain in 2015, when 6 million people tuned in to a BBC TV film adaptation.
</li><li> Lessing's Nathan der Weise still resonates with its message of tolerance, even though it is only limited to Muslims Christians and Jews in the narrative and the famous ring parable that even (daringly for its time) suggested that all three of them were wrong. Dust off the somewhat antiquated language and you could make it a modern movie with little to no effort, even though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny">some of its narrative devices</a> have not aged as well as the message.
</li><li> One of the reasons <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></em> has endured over the years is because of its Aesop about how parents pass things down to their children - including prejudices. The young have to suffer from the mistakes of the old, and it takes the death of the two lovers to finally make the families realize how senseless the conflict was. One of the reasons there are many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholePlotReference" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholePlotReference">Whole Plot References</a> to it is because the story is one that's easily applicable to modern life. In fact the majority of fans of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RomeoAndJuliet1968" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RomeoAndJuliet1968">the 1968 film version</a> were the teenagers of the day, who could relate to the passion of the story. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OliviaHussey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OliviaHussey">Olivia Hussey</a>, who played Juliet in that version, says she continued to get fan letters from young teenagers decades after the film came out.

In addition, it also included the influences of private enterprises over social and political level along with abuses towards employees and citizens emphasized by Midgar's socioeconomic inequality and sufferings thanks to Shinra's prioritization of profits over welfare. That is if one ignores the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a> of coal being portrayed as one of the nature-friendly alternatives to Mako Energy.
<ul><li> It could be read as as illustrating a detail that differs a lot from real life. In the FFVII world, coal stopped being a ubiquitous power source once Shinra started investing in and pushing mako energy, even in the mining town of Corel. That could mean a return to pre-industrial levels of atmospheric co2, so the use of fossil fuels could take a while before they reach dangerous levels. Also, mako kills the planet in itself, while fossil fuels causes climate change.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Oddworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Oddworld">Oddworld</a></em> series has a heavy anti-corporate, pro-environment message with corporations being depicted as evil bastards who will do anything to make a profit including slavery and torturing their employees, and are polluting and destroying the environment of the world. With the rise of corporatism in America, corrupt business practices and sleazy laws favoring corporations over people, as well as climate change and pollution being a big issue now, the message of the games is more relevant than ever. Furthermore, it also shows that the reason these big corporations came into power was partly thanks to the apathy those who could have stopped them.
</li><li> While our planet hasn't thankfully turned into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx">Deus Ex</a></em>, the game's messages about mass surveillance, mass hysteria caused by terrorism, increasingly oppressive laws passed to combat it and government favoritism towards corporate elite at the cost of ordinary citizens rights hit much closer to home today than they did in 2000 after events like 9/11 attacks, War on Terror, Occupy movement's protests and the disclosures about NSA's national surveillance program starting in 2013.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlphaCentauri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlphaCentauri">Alpha Centauri</a></em> became more relevant in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a> as its context—both gameplay and lore—of conflict based on political-polarization with each faction, and environmental consciousness.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RoloToTheRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RoloToTheRescue">Rolo to the Rescue</a></em> was released in the early 90s, at a time where an elephant saving his friends from the circus would be seen as a fantasy. Fast forward to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>, and Rolo's cause is certainly a lot more heroic now that the general public has turned against traveling circuses for their mistreatment of animals.

In the decades since the episode aired, police brutality and abuse of power became far more widespread and talked-about issues, making Lisa's concerns very prevalent today.

When the deception is revealed, the pair smugly inform the populace that because America runs on a two-party system, one of them will <em>still</em> rise to power. It's not quite as funny in 2016, where the two major candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are highly controversial and polarizing, third party candidates are starting to gain a lot more attention, and where faith in the two major parties is at its lowest level.

It covered many mature topics for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a> cartoon, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming">Slut-Shaming</a>, depression, bullying, and puberty.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> has done this many times:

Without naming examples, given many real-life cases have controversially faced accusations of similar motives and have only increased greatly in the present day, the episode feels even more significant now than it did in 1999.

</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS4E12TrapperKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS4E12TrapperKeeper">Trapper Keeper</a>" satirized the outcome of the 2000 election with Rosie O'Donnell objecting to the results of the kindergarten's student election just because her nephew didn't win. This episode became relevant again in 2016 when protests erupted immediately after Trump was elected and he took office with single-digit approval ratings from Democrats.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em>: As stated by <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcHt9tW8oo0">this video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SpongeBobSquarePantsS1E2BubblestandRippedPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SpongeBobSquarePantsS1E2BubblestandRippedPants">Ripped Pants</a>" perfectly captures the fleeting nature of meme culture even when it was released in 1999. By ripping his pants, SpongeBob becomes the most popular guy on the beach, but by trying to ride on its fame a little too much, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedMeme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedMeme">the joke loses its value</a>, alienating even his closest friends.

<ul><li> The pleas for conserving natural resources in "The Energy Blues" are as relevant now in the 20-teens as they were in the 1970s (possibly because the need to do so hasn't faded from the public consciousness).
</li><li> The "Tyrannosaurus Debt" song isn't that dated, considering concern about the economy and the U.S. owing money to other nations (with China being the biggest).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess">Recess</a></em>:
<ul><li> The episode "Economics of Recess" focuses on the lead character TJ using cheap labor from younger kids in order to eventually obtain all of the playground's monster sticker currency and own everything, which makes it impossible for any of the other kids to enjoy anything. At the end of the episode, TJ is persuaded to sign a contract that prevents monopolies in the schoolyard. The episode feels even more clever today, with the 2016 and 2020 Bernie Sanders campaigns calling for socialism as higher income citizens amass more power and aren't taxed fairly, while corporations such as Apple and Amazon pay their employees poorly despite being insanely lucrative.
</li><li> The episode "Recess Is Canceled" focuses on how the government attempts to raise test scores by eliminating recess. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">This results in just the opposite</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">necessitating the return of recess</a>. Even today, whether recess is good for elementary-school children or a waste of valuable time still arouses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">heated debate</a>. Fortunately, plenty of research shows that <a class="urllink" href="http://time.com/4982061/recess-benefits-research-debate/">at least 20 minutes of recess per day is beneficial for students, whereas kids who don't get recess are less likely to actually learn and more likely to fidget<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, making this episode very much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the reasons for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife">Rocko's Modern Life</a></em> lasting appeal is how it's arguably the first cartoon to discuss <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstWorldProblems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstWorldProblems">the struggles of "adulting"</a> (i.e., being self-reliant in your early twenties), a universal concept among young adults in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>. And the running gag with the in-universe corporation Conglom-O is that it owns everything. With the buyouts of <em>Marvel</em>, <em>National Geographic</em>, <em>Star Wars</em>, and Fox by Disney, it's hard not to draw comparisons.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987">DuckTales (1987)</a></em> episode <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DuckTalesBlueCollarScrooge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DuckTalesBlueCollarScrooge">Blue Collar Scrooge</a></em> dealt with themes of respecting workers' rights and the relationship between bosses and employees. Needless to say, still <em>very</em> relevant as of today.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em>: Jodie's struggles and discussions on race relations were relevant during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a>, but have obviously become a <strong>lot</strong> more relevant in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>, so much so in fact that the proposed reboot has <em>her</em> as Daria's new right-hand instead of Jane.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lil, the most prominent girl of the babies, is quite unconventional for a female character in the 90s. She enjoys doing gross boyish things like playing in the mud with her brother, but also happily playing with dolls and having other girly past times. At an age where pink frills and saccharine cuteness are often foisted on young girls, it's very refreshing to see Lil have a mixture of masculine and feminine traits without affecting her friendship with the others. Susie and Kimi have their own positive character traits as well (intelligence and maturity for Susie, imagination and bravery for Kimi) to create a nice collection of diverse young girls with their own interests.
</li><li> The episode "The Clan Of The Duck," where Chuckie and Phil wear Lil's dresses with a hugely positive message about not conforming to gender stereotypes. That was in <em>1997</em>! More than 20 years later, the DK-published <em>Rugrats Guide to Adulting</em> acknowledged the resonance.
</li><li> The Mother's Day special has earned lots of praise, retroactive and otherwise, for a number of reasons. First of all, in one of the flashbacks, Betty is depicted breastfeeding a newborn Phil and Lil, and this depiction is a loving depiction, in a time when negative attitudes toward breastfeeding were still entrenched in some countries. Second of all, when the babies discuss what a mother does with her baby, Chuckie realizes that his widowed father, Chas, is as nurturing as any mother, with a positive message that a "mother" need not necessarily be female.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Duckman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Duckman">Duckman</a></em>, the titular characters launches into a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knIroVvPZU4">rant against super sanitized comedy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, something that is arguably more relevant today than when it originally aired in 1994.

</li><li> The American Declaration of Independence is an exquisite distillation of much of the philosophical thought and political theory of the Age of Enlightenment. As such, its text forms the underpinnings of practically all Western-style Democracies today, clearly elucidating what government is for, and why: to serve The People. In particular, the first half of the second paragraph is specifically cited by most countries when forming a democratic government as the guiding principles of how that government is to function. Not bad for almost 250 years.
