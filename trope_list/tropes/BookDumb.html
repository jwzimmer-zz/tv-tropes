</div></div><p>Many main characters in children's shows (and in adult's shows featuring children) are explicitly shown as doing very badly in school, despite showing themselves to be of at least average intelligence in most other areas of life. This isn't inconsistency on the part of the writers, though. The kid is just Book Dumb.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Making your child character Book Dumb is seen as a great way to appeal to the masses (especially when creating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou">This Loser Is You</a>) without having to show them being outsmarted by other characters on a regular basis. A Book Dumb character will usually show excellent "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetSmart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetSmart">street smarts</a>", is quite capable of thinking on their feet, and is often very good at problem solving most of the time, but he (and it is usually a boy) does not function well within a regimented learning system. Maybe he's just not good at that type of learning. Maybe he's clever, but can't resist an opportunity for mischief. In extreme cases, he may even be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius">genius</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">inventor</a> at home, but devolves into a functionally illiterate bad boy as soon as he enters through the school gates. Maybe he's just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToFool">Too Dumb to Fool</a>. Or he might be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz">Genius Ditz</a>. But he is rarely an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticStudent">Apathetic Student</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>On the other hand, some writers will try the opposite rationale and use it as a criticism of the <em>school system</em>, either claiming that schools are staffed by incompetent idiots who don't know intelligence when they see it, or that schools are deliberately designed to stifle innovation and free will in order to turn kids into mindless future wage slaves.
</p><p>Some characters are book dumb due to having been denied a formal education for various reasons. They might not be in any way stupid or lazy but a lack of opportunity has simply restricted their progression.
</p><p>His own attitude to his schooling varies considerably, often within the same series. One episode may call for him to seem to care about his problem, and try very hard to get the work done, whereas another episode may show him really not caring about schoolwork at all. This doesn't matter; as long as the writer gets across that this character isn't some kind of fancy intellectual at whom the audience should sneer, then the Book Dumb has done its job.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>In shows with high school characters, Book Dumb often overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledButCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledButCute">Troubled, but Cute</a>, especially in Western media.
</p><p>This is also common among adults, who will be portrayed as not having done very well at school, even though today they may be a famous novelist, celebrated artist, top sportsman, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">nuclear safety inspector</a>. If the character is doing a non-creative job, he will usually be just as ineffective in his job as he was at school (though always managing to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeorgeJetsonJobSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeorgeJetsonJobSecurity">George Jetson Job Security</a>), while displaying considerable intelligence in other areas of their life.
</p><p>More or less the polar opposite of the stereotypical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerd">Nerd</a>, who does excellently in school but is shown as being almost completely incompetent in all other areas of life. Both can be very intelligent people, but only in certain circumstances. The different attitudes of most people to each type of character betray our society's mistrust of intellect. Both, however, can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Geek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Geek">Geeks</a>.
</p><p>Book Dumb female characters are quite common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">Anime</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manga">Manga</a> but in Western media this trope tends to skew heavily male. The popularity of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UptownGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UptownGirl">Uptown Girl</a> trope might also be a factor.
</p><p>This trope has quite a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. As any teacher can tell you, there is something about the school system that <em>does</em> alienate a certain portion of otherwise intelligent children, although the pervasiveness of this trope frustrates some students that are held to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius">Teen Genius</a> standards by their parents, wondering why nobody that actually does <em>well</em> in school is ever the main character. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Most troublingly</a>, this trope is popular among <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-intellectualism">anti-intellectuals<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who argue that academic smarts are entirely worthless. Of course, being anti-intellectuals, their arguments lack a certain... something. Luckily some school systems are trying to do things to solve this problem, as it often makes learning easier for everybody anyway, and several systems have been in use since just after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a>, although wide-spread adoption has yet to occur anywhere. Also, most book-dumb people in real-life often resort to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">looking up the answers to their schoolwork online</a>—typically through the likes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>—to put on an intelligent façade in pursuit of popularity.
</p><p>Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVGenius">TV Genius</a>, who <em>only</em> seems intelligent in the classroom, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DitzyGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DitzyGenius">Ditzy Genius</a>, who is a genius in academics but inept in everyday life. Also contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a>, who is very talented and arrogantly proud of it.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheQuintessentialQuintuplets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheQuintessentialQuintuplets">The Quintessential Quintuplets</a></em>: As the Nakano sisters were all nearly held back a year before transferring schools, leading their father to hire a private tutor out of desperation to help whip the five of them into shape; which is where Fuutarou comes in.
</li><li> Ermengarde in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessSarah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessSarah">Princess Sarah</a></em>, like her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ALittlePrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ALittlePrincess">original incarnation</a>, is portrayed as scatterbrained and scholastically backward; in a flashback, we also see that this may be related to neglect by her father, a university professor. However, she is also portrayed as good-hearted and generous, loyal to Sara even after she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenPrincess">loses both father and fortune</a>, and nurses Sara when she falls seriously ill. She also is the only person, apart from Sara, whom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kawaiiko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kawaiiko">Lottie</a> can relate to, at least to some extent.
</li><li> Tomo, Osaka and Kagura from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh">Azumanga Daioh</a></em> play this one to some degree. The three of them are pretty much as intelligent as any high school girl, yet their scores are so low, they once added them and got 104, or in American, an A++ (if Chiyo, Sakaki and Yomi did that, it would be roughly a 270 / AAA++++++). This is mostly justified, though, because Tomo is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">Genki Girl</a> with the attention span of a squirrel, Osaka is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolander</a> with the attention span of a squirrel, and Kagura is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bokukko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bokukko">Jock</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">with the attention span of a squirrel</a>.
<ul><li> It's actually played with until the end of the series, where Tomo, Osaka, and Kagura all pass their entrance exams to college before the pseudo-Geek Yomi (complete with a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a></em> from the teacher on how weird that is).
</li></ul></li><li> Yue Ayase from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> is one of the smartest girls in the class, not counting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Traveller</a>. She adores reading, especially philosophy. It's just that reality is so incredibly pointless that she doesn't care to try at all, which places her in the lowest grade percentile of the class. (The so-called "Baka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Rangers</a>.")
<ul><li> Also fellow Baka Ranger Kaede Nagase, who actually seems to be a very wise girl for her age. Perhaps the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja">Ninja</a> training just gets in the way of her studies.
</li><li> Both Asuna and Ku Fei (also of the Baka Rangers) have both shown impressive tactical skills and Asuna is very good at judging the emotions of others. Admittedly Ku Fei has to work with the handicap of a less than perfect grasp of Japanese (you try learning to speak language A taught in language B when C is your native tongue), and it is widely speculated that what ever spell keeps Asuna from remembering her past also interferes with her general memorization skills. In fact of the five only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a> Makie is arguably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">just plain dumb</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Senshi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon">Delicious in Dungeon</a></em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetSmart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetSmart">Street Smart</a>, but he doesn't read books much and distrust magic. He is even unaware that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> dragon carcass is very flammable due to its fuel-producing innards and tried to start fire nearby.</span>
</li><li> Inversion: Despite being an apparent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Delinquents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Delinquents">delinquent</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShonenDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShonenDemographic">shonen</a></em> lead, Ichigo Kurosaki of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> has one of the highest grade point averages in the school, to the chagrin of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">normal friends</a> who are upset that he betrays his stereotype. He replies that he gets enough flak from the teachers for getting into fights and his strange hair colour, so he studies hard to make sure that at least they can't complain about his grades. However, in battle he tends to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy">charge in without a plan</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">ignore his allies plans</a>.
<ul><li> It's the same with Chad (who gets a higher score than Ichigo), except he's not so much of a delinquent anymore.
</li><li> Then there's Orihime, who, despite her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">space-case</a> tendencies, manages to get at least 3rd in their entire grade.
</li><li> Keigo, however, is a straight example. He takes great pride in having low grades and being an idiot. However, Mizuiro once said that Keigo is actually very intelligent but is deliberately sabotaging his education. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Eventually, he's revealed to be extremely good under life-threatening pressure when he's the only one to keep his head enough to make everyone take advantage of Aizen and Gin confronting each other and flee before Aizen can turn on them. He was also able to put together something he'd seen hundreds of chapters ago which made him realise that a shinigami's weapon was the only thing that stood a chance against a being like Aizen, and he was prepared to use the weapon in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to give his companions a chance to escape.

It seems he can only think properly under life threatening danger, but has apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">grown out of this</a> after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> (said score has gone up to 3). (In fairness, he had no parents to teach him anything.)
<ul><li> Justified because, as Kakashi once stated, Naruto is a kinesthetic learner—the type who learns "with his body" or "by doing"—which didn't serve him very well during the mostly theoretical training at the academy. Once he actually starts doing missions and acquiring battle experience, he winds up mastering a handful of techniques that are well beyond a beginner's level, if, occasionally, in roundabout manners, and proves himself a very fast learner who somewhat overtakes the analytical and traditionally talented Sasuke until the latter makes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a>. They remained roughly on par ever since. Further justified in that Naruto is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedInsideAPersonShapedCan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedInsideAPersonShapedCan">host of the 9-nailed demon fox</a> and the seal interferes with his ability to control his chakra properly.
</li><li> Sakura's something of an inversion in Part I, as she aces every test in the academy, but rarely puts her intelligence to practical use in the field (for example, she doesn't see through either of the fake Narutos in the Forest of Death before Sasuke, who has 1.5 fewer intelligence points in the databook, pointed them out). She winds up becoming a mostly brute-force focused fighter as far as her strictly offensive capabilities are concerned. Her intelligence is ultimately put to use in medical jutsu.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">Shikamaru</a>'s academy grades are not much better than Naruto's (mainly because he's so lazy that applying pencil on paper tends to be a drag for him and he sleeps through the exams), but he has an IQ of over 200 (which if he lived in the real world would make him quite possibly the smartest person who ever lived) and demonstrates his intelligence through his brilliant strategies. Even his intelligence has been admired by people like Kakashi and the Third Hokage. Sakura once said that Shikamaru is the smartest ninja in the Land of Fire.

(The fact that he's still a 10-to-12-year-old kid who spent his entire life as a child soldier doesn't help.)

<ul><li> Besides being a slacker in school, Jonouchi (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Joey</a>) is often confused by cards everyone else knows about, doesn't understand how the game's chain mechanic works, and often has to count on his fingers to do math. That said, once he understands said cards/mechanics he becomes an extremely capable duelist, able to devise fairly complex strategies on the fly.
</li><li> Yugi from was shown in the manga to be a very poor student, despite being considered a gaming genius by the other characters. One chapter shows him make a Bingo game out of test score results, being utterly uncaring of the fact that he himself scored 372nd in the school.

This does appear to be partly by choice, as he's turned down promotion at least once on screen. Perhaps the writers just think he'd look horrible in Yellow or Blue...
<ul><li> This actually becomes a plot point in season 3. Because he's widely regarded as one of the best duelists at the school, many younger students start emulating him - meaning they skip or sleep in class and don't study. According to Professor Satou, those students lack Judai's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">natural ability</a> at Duel Monsters. Satou ends up forcing Judai into a duel with another student's life hanging in the balance - and somehow still pulls off being a <em>sympathetic character.</em> The whole ordeal functions as part of Judai's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Sho was also like this for a while, being a fairly competent duelist and student whose fear of failure always sabotaged his efforts in season 1. By season 3, he is temporarily promoted to Blue, but goes back to Yellow because he doesn't believe himself worthy yet. In season 4, though, he accepts the promotion.

Jotaro actually ends up being a marine biologist (of all things) later on, which goes to show he isn't as dumb as one might think.

In the novels, he ends up needing Haruhi's help on at least one assignment.
<ul><li> Lampshaded by Kyon himself: "Why is it that I can be so smart when it comes to reading Nagato's facial expressions or Koizumi's hidden clues, but fail to answer every single test question?"
</li><li> In addition to knowing a lot, he has a damn sharp mind, as evidenced by his deduction of what <em>really</em> happened on their summer trip at the end of book 3.
</li><li> It also doesn't help that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LemonyNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LemonyNarrator">Kyon</a> is among the most notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrators</a> in fiction.
</li></ul></li><li> Tsukasa from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar">Lucky Star</a></em> is a hopeless lazy ass capable of sleeping from 10:00 PM to 2:00 PM, while Konata is so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku">otaku</a> she actually forgets to do her homework. In fact, Konata admits in one particular episode that she's perfectly capable of achieving high marks, but her obsessive and procrastination habits just fill in more than academics. The minor character Misao is similar to Konata, but she'd more inclined towards <em>outdoor</em> activities.
<ul><li> Konata got into this locally prestigious high school by the lure of a PS2 <em>and</em> a PC.
<ul><li> In one episode she demonstrates her ability to cram for a test with a single all-nighter; she manages to get the same good score as Kagami, despite of that the latter studied for the same test well over a week.

He once got a <em>twelve</em> (yes, twelve out of 100) on a test. However, on the battlefield, he's a fairly competent strategist, and in one episode, he correctly applies the principle of light reflection to defeat Hiei. There's also Kuwabara, who starts out Book Dumb (he got a <em>seven</em> on that same test; Yusuke was bragging that he was smarter), and, as part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, studies hard and gets into a prestigious high school.

<ul><li> Kyo is a subversion; he has the personality of a delinquent and is obsessed with martial arts, but he's actually a good student.
</li><li> Played straighter with Tohru, who is highly emotionally intelligent and insightful when it comes to people's feelings, but struggles with her grades and often needs help with studying.
</li><li> Hanajima is smart, but simply doesn't give a damn about schoolwork (except when faced with the threat of summer school in non-air conditioned rooms, when she makes sure to avoid failing grades).
</li></ul></li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SlamDunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SlamDunk">Slam Dunk</a></em> episode features <em>four</em> members of the Shohoku Team failing their exams with <em>ridiculous</em> results.

</li><li> Luffy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> is very book dumb when it comes to science and medicine  he once tried to heal a wounded Zoro by pouring booze on his face because "Zoro likes sake, so it'll make him better". One of the TV specials implies that he can't even read. However, he's extremely good at coming up with the best ways to use his Devil Fruit powers to their fullest in various situations. One that particularly sticks out is when he out-smarts Eneru's Mantra mind-reading ability... by out-<em>dumbing</em> him. He intentionally thinks of nothing (The name of said technique translated as "Gum-Gum Space-Out"). That trick actually fails, since Luffy realizes too late that he can't attack without thinking, but he then immediately starts bouncing punches off a wall. He has no idea of what the redirected punches will hit, making it impossible for Eneru to dodge them by reading his mind.
</li><li> One of the rare female examples is Maya Kitajima from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GlassMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GlassMask">Glass Mask</a></em>, who is able to memorize full scripts and acknowledges lots of acting techniques, but is barely average at school. She lampshades this by thinking she's just not interested in academic prowess.

However, he is shown to be bad in school Performance with bleak prospect on college. The very first case, however, mentions that he gets the highest score in the entire history of Fudo High's entrance exam, indicating that he can make it if he tries to study. The thing is, he is not seen putting much effort in studying (as evidenced by him resorting to cheating at the beginning of Wax Doll Castle Murder Case) coupled with his growing game addiction. He is still able to answer questions that rely on logic though.

<ul><li> However, in Tsumihoroboshi-hen, it is revealed that Keiichi <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> has scored into genius level on IQ tests, and is quite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondHisYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondHisYears">smarter than he initially seems</a>, yet has a pathological block that requires him to be interested in the subject to do well</span>. He is also shown to help Mion and Rena with their studies, and Mion is a year older than him...
</li></ul></li><li> Tsunayoshi Sawada from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Katekyō Hitman Reborn!</a></em>. In the beginning, he's pretty much the school's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> that gets the worst grades. And for the longest time, it really <em>did</em> look like he was all-around useless. However, after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift">the series got more serious</a>, he's shown to not actually be stupid - when he's determined and <em>tries</em>, he's very smart about fighting and utilizing his abilities in combat. He still has bad grades, but it's shown that if people actually bother to help him, he actually can sufficiently well in class (e.g. the time when G disguised himself as Gokudera and tutored Tsuna, and he manages to solve a problem in class).
<ul><li> Yamamoto, though not as bad as Tsuna, is definitely smarter outside the classroom than in it. Interestingly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledButCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledButCute">Troubled, but Cute</a> Gokudera pretty much has perfect grades despite his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Delinquents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Delinquents">delinquent</a> appearance and attitude towards everyone but Tsuna.
</li></ul></li><li> Sagara Sousuke from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em>. He doesn't tend to do very well in school. Granted, it's not like he has a lot of street smarts in relation to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">normal people's survival and lives</a> either, but... he sure is good at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">fighting</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazySurvivalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazySurvivalist">surviving</a> in the combat zone. Not to mention his knack for rescuing people. An episode shows that Sousuke's problem is he is just unable to think outside of military terms and situations. He reads classic poetry and somehow comes to the conclusion that it's talking about a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WW2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WW2">WW2</a> Naval battle.
</li><li> Miaka from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi">Fushigi Yuugi</a></em> is a borderline female example. You'd think that all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">stomach thinking</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyrWithoutACause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyrWithoutACause">putting herself needlessly in danger</a> would reflect in dis-interest for studies, but her grades aren't abysmally bad <em>and</em> she's shown having an interest in studying so she can get in a good highschool, like Yui. This is even more accentuated in the manga, where it's explained as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">her way to seek for the approval of her</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama">Education Mama</a>. Ends up subverted at the end of the TV anime series, when it's revealed that Miaka passed the entrance exam to Jonan while Yui, who's more traditionally smart, did not. They both end up going to a different high school together.

<ul><li> Ash (Satoshi) inevitably ends up like this any time he's placed in a traditional school setting. An episode of DP has him failing miserably during a Pokémon quiz, leading another character to question how a trainer with such poor academic knowledge of Pokémon could have earned 6 badges. The episode eventually leads to an Aesop about how learning theory in school doesn't necessarily make one good at actually doing something in real life. The character who mocked Ash's low score gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty">curbstomped</a> in a real battle against <em>the Team Rocket trio</em>, without any dirty tricks, because he had no actual experience and had no idea what to do other than list off attack names.
<ul><li> The <em>Sun &amp; Moon</em> series shows him being fully aware of this; when struggling with an assignment to give an oral report on differences between Alolan and Kantonian Pokémon, he tells Professor Kukui that he thinks it would be better if Lillie or Sophocles did it instead.

He's known for his success with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy">on-the-fly solutions</a>, though he's also capable of coming up with intricate plans, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.anymanga.com/ranma/018/010/004/">such as the one he used to get Happosai to change Pantyhose Taro's name<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. He's attentive and smart, to the point where he can reproduce a martial arts move after seeing it only once and then find its weak spot. Too bad he's kind of Book Dumb in certain areas.

Despite this, or perhaps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance">because of it</a>, he manages to not only reinvent nearly every baking technique from scratch, he improves on them.

In the first episode, he didn't even know what pollution is. He sadly lampshades this in that he is only suited for fighting and is not equipped to help in problems concerning economics and politics. He <em>is</em> quite clever and practical, just ignorant, and he learns quickly.

Especially compared to his <em>younger</em> twin brother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius">Yukio</a>. However, like most book dumb characters he's shown to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetSmart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetSmart">Street Smart</a>; on the field he's pretty quick on the uptake, he's very good at connecting to and inspiring others, and has shown some pretty interesting flashes of natural abilities, such as one instance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthHiBye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthHiBye">Stealth Hi/Bye</a> in a room full of <em>experienced exorcists</em>. He just can't seem to connect to academics like his brother, though he did get a Junior High Diploma and manage to become an Exwire. The fact he, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, sleeps <strong>eleven hours</strong> per day (possibly half because he's half-demon)probably doesn't help, and neither does his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop">Locked Out of the Loop</a> status before he entered cram school (which justifies his ridiculously low scores at the start). His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">Stepford Smiler</a> status throws some doubt into just how "dumb" he is as well.
</li><li> A filler episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beelzebub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beelzebub">Beelzebub</a></em> reveal that the students of Ishiyama High hate studying <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">180%</a></em> — so you can imagine their surprise when they are given an assessment test. The students of the school are so stupid that even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Oga</a> is stunned. "Good Night" Shimokawa couldn't even spell his trademark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Catch Phrase</a>, and one student even cheated on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">filling in his name</a></em> during the test; and the worst part was that the test was on elementary school subjects. At the same time, Oga was in a pinch during Beel's assessment test and was going to dump him off the smartest guy in the school — meaning the guy who got the highest score on the test. Luckily, he managed to pass that assessment test anyway because it turns out the smartest person at Ishiyama High was Furuichi, the only person in the school who isn't a delinquent. Though that was probably because the smarter characters didn't even try. Himekawa, perhaps the smartest person of the entire main cast, made no effort to try and cheated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney">taping some money to his paper as a bribe</a>.

Hinata's test scores are so low he doesn't even know the passing grade and has once remarked that he'd never gotten a double-digit score in any exam. Kageyama, however, is the most surprising one. On one hand, he's known in-series as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius">volleyball prodigy</a>, is on-par with arguably the most intelligent member of his team with regards to tactics, and has been shown to memorize volleyball signs in less than five seconds. On the other hand, his grades are catastrophically low, he thinks the brain is a muscle, doesn't know what veteran means... the list goes on and on.

This is because anything resembling a formal education is a rarity for them, with most instead learning survival skills on the streets and growing up to be very cunning individuals. When she begins attending school as a regular student, Touka often struggles in her studies due to having spent much of her childhood on the streets. However, she genuinely enjoys school and eventually states she would like to become a teacher.

Before that he thought 14, not 12, came after eleven and afterwards it's revealed during his fight with Ninja Murasaki that he still can't count past 25. Even as an adult he still comes off as an idiot, even before factoring in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism">English dub</a> making him sound reasonably smarter (it doesn't help that in the original Japanese he speaks with a downplayed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TohokuRegionalAccent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TohokuRegionalAccent">Tohoku Regional Accent</a>, a dialect that's typically associated with country hicks). As an adult, though he still can be naive and a little too willing to trust others, what keeps him from being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Idiot Hero</a> is that he can show surprising wisdom and his clear that his intelligence is focused on combat. When it comes to fighting, he's a genius, able to point to pick up on the strengths and the flaws of various techniques, outthink his opponents with good strategies, and he can learn and invent new techniques with relative ease.
</li><li> In his debut appearance during the Tenshinhan Saga, Chaozu has trouble with basic math and can't tell left from right without pausing to think which hand he holds chopsticks in. Apparently, unlike Muten Roshi, Tsuru-sennin doesn't bother providing his students with basic schooling.

However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">Majin Buu</a> fails the test by writing his own name wrong and falling asleep, and Goku barely passes by reaching the minimum score.

It's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> how she only ever writes in hiragana and still can't write in kanji at all (by Japanese standards, this means she essentially writes like a kindergartener since children start learning how to write kanji in elementary school). One letter written to her by her <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighQueen">future</a></em> counterpart is entirely in hiragana, and she begs the present Usagi to study hard.

He argues that, having spent his childhood in America, he can't understand enough Japanese to do well on his tests. Which would be plausible, except that he <em>also</em> does terribly (as in, scores only a few marks) in <strong>English</strong>. His excuse for this is that it's not actually English you use on a day to day basis. Aomine, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">very similar</a> to Kagami, is shown to be this as well (like Kagami, he's also only really good at basketball). Kise's grades are said to also be pretty bad, albeit slightly better than Kagami's and Aomine's. As for the rest of the Generation of Miracles, Kuroko's are extremely average, Midorima's somewhat intelligent, Murasakibara's aren't really talked about, and Akashi is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius">Teen Genius</a> (though it's implied he's worked very hard with his studies.)

Because of this, he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">been hit by previous tutors</a> and has developed a fear of studying and refuses to have anything to do with it. This has lead to him <em>not knowing what one plus one is</em> (much to the the amusement of his brothers, especially Licht). It's shown that he's very athletic and is good at sword fighting and horse riding — more than anything else, it seems like it's the fear of being beaten that's hindering his studying than actually being dumb, although he <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">ditzy</a> in general.
<ul><li> Eventually, Heine manages to convince Leonhard that he'll actually help him study and not hurt him, and Leonhard learns basic mathematics by being taught to visualise his favourite cake (for example, you have one slice. If you put another slice on your plate, how many do you have? Two slices). In a later chapter of the manga, Leonhard runs into one of his former tutors and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">becomes convinced</a> that Heine will punish him for not getting every answer correct, even though he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">fully aware</a> that Heine's never done that before. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Heine figures out what Leonhard's worries are and reminds Leonhard that he'd never physically hurt Leonhard or any of the others.

He does really poorly at school, though in his defense, saving people, the city, or the world often eats up the time he could have used to study.

Superman helps maintain the advanced Kryptonian equipment in his Fortress. And on at least one occasion he has said to Batman's face that he was just as smart as Batman, which Batman openly agreed with. If anything Superman is an inversion; he's book smart but does not have a talent for combat and tactics, so people (both in and out of universe) assume he is less intelligent based on how he fights. Even then, that's mostly because Superman is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">so incredibly powerful</a> that he usually doesn't <em>need</em> to fight in the first place, not to mention as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist">Technical Pacifist</a> he much prefers to end confrontations non-violently whenever he can get away with it and thus, what tactics he does use often are not about "winning" a fight in the traditional sense.

<ul><li> Calvin of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a></em> is shown to be very far behind his classmates academically, but is a loquacious philosopher in his spare time, showing a vocabulary and critical thinking skills far in advance of what you could expect from a normal 6-year-old. In this case, it's an explicit criticism of the school system. Bill Watterson has also said that he enjoyed having Calvin use big words to describe stupid ideas. It's also implied that Calvin, while intelligent, is simply not motivated to apply himself. In one strip, for example, his father sits him down and <em>asks</em> him why he doesn't do better in school, noting that he's obviously smart because he managed to devour every dinosaur book he ever got his hands on. Calvin simply replies that they never study dinosaurs in school. He has shown considerable aptitude in school-grade subjects like math and reading comprehension in situations where the subjects, such as dinosaurs or time travel, were interesting to him. Calvin is a classic case of a gifted child in an education system that isn't engaging him properly. <br/>In addition, Calvin is also very mischievous, more interested in causing trouble and messing with the teacher's head than actually learning. He regularly gives bizarre answers on his tests ("What is the significance of the Erie Canal?" "In the cosmic sense, probably nil,") which seems to be as much for his own amusement as an attempt to cheat the system.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/DennisTheMenaceUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/DennisTheMenaceUK">Dennis the Menace (UK)</a></em> is an example of this being taken to a ridiculous degree. In the comics these days, Dennis even has a <em>futuristic car that he designed himself</em>, with protective armour and water cannons, and yet is shown to be completely (and cheerfully) lost at school.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/ForBetterOrForWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/ForBetterOrForWorse">For Better or for Worse</a></em>, one word: Gordon. While Gordon graduates high school with average grades, he is a gifted mechanic who turns out to have a decent head for business. He goes to work for a local outfit, and within ten years all but owns the place, it being sold to him when the owner retired; he then takes the store from a local landmark ("Oh, right, that place") to a thriving business which, the last time it was seen before the strip's conclusion, may well have been on the verge of becoming a franchise.

<ul><li> Peppermint Patty would rather be playing sports than sitting in a classroom, compounded by not getting much sleep weeknights because she waits for her father to get home from work at night. On the other hand, any girl her age who could be capable of mistaking a dog obedience school for a human school to the point of enrolling in it, "studying" with the dogs, graduating and being so sure that she doesn't have to go to regular human school because of that "diploma" is on her own level of stupidity. She already thinks Snoopy is a 'little kid with a big nose' and treats him accordingly. Remember, with Patty, we're quite far into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">Jock</a> territory, too. As if she didn't have enough downward pressure on her grades.
</li><li> Sally also has a lot of trouble in school, and often struggles with her homework despite Charlie Brown's patient efforts to help her. One of the strip's running jokes is the unintentionally humorous school reports she gives in front of the class, which are frequently inspired by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Malaproper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Malaproper">malapropisms</a> and end with her feeling humiliated as her classmates laugh at her. Some of her more memorable reports include "Santa and his Rain Gear", "Footbidextrousers" people, "The Bronchitis" (a dinosaur that supposedly went extinct from coughing too much), and her report on the oceans of the world, in which she reported there are no oceans in the individual landlocked states in the US.
</li></ul></li><li> Caulfield, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Frazz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Frazz">Frazz</a></em>.

Felipe is absent-minded during lectures, but he never seems to fail a test.

For example, she can read better than many grown men, even if she mispronounces some things and halts in odd places (reading is a passion she's not have had much time for before her capture), but her arithmetic is at best poor and handwriting barely decipherable and she can't read maps. Not satisfied with such potential being wasted in meager duties, the mostly self-taught warlord decides to educate her himself, and she makes great progress.

Similarly, when Malty exonerates him of having allegedly raped her, Naofumi almost immediately puzzles out that she was expected to betray him as part of a plot by the king.
<ul><li> On other occassions, Naofumi immediately dismisses the other heroes claim that being the shield hero makes him useless, citing how important tanks are in multiplayer games. He also realizes that the two "envoys" sent by Siltvelt are low level spies given that their "plan" to smuggle him out of the country is to take him by carriage through the main road connecting the two countries, which is fortified by a heavy garrison. Naofumi takes a moment to explain why leaving Melomarc is a bad idea to begin with as it'd paint him as a deserter, and that's if everyone at the garrison thinks rationally and lets him pass rather than killing him.

He's able to come up with elaborate plans on-the-spot to turn the tables around in a bad situation but he can't even spell his own alias correctly. Jim too. As a slave, he's uneducated (and it shows), but he can be pretty philosophical about what he <em>does</em> know.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Maskerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Maskerade">Maskerade</a></em>, Granny Weatherwax is described as "grudgingly literate but keenly numerate". In an early book, she initially couldn't comprehend the un-reality of a local play.
</li><li> Cohen the Barbarian is illiterate, though he loves books (they make for good lavatory paper), but he's got so much cunning and guile it doesn't matter. Unlike most barbarians, he does have a great deal of genuine respect for education, though. He had a Geography teacher as part of his retinue and trusted adviser in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterestingTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterestingTimes">Interesting Times</a></em>, and would listen and defer to him when faced with a problem he was best equipped to tackle. He even proved himself willing to listen to <em>Rincewind</em> when he thinks what the man has to say is relevant.
</li><li> Leonard of Quirm, despite being possibly the most well-read and brilliant man on the Disc when it comes to what we Roundworlders would call "actual" science, seems to think that an excess of education or training can be a bad thing, leading to a flaw he calls "learning the limits of the possible"—i.e., a failure of imagination. He failed the Alchemists' Guild exam due to doodling complex devices in the margins and absent-mindedly correcting the questions. Is also rather bad at coming up with names for his inventions for some reason.
</li><li> Perhaps the finest example of this in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a>, however, is Harry King, who like Cohen tends to use certain kinds of paper for lavatory use (his wife likes newspaper when it's recycled, but King himself prefers to "cut out the middleman"). He was born a poor street kid and eventually came to be <em>the</em> waste management consultant in Ankh-Morpork. William de Worde, by no means stupid and possibly the most well-read person in Ankh-Morpork outside of the Patrician, had the "uncomfortable moment when an educated man realizes the illiterate person sizing him up could probably out-think him three times over"
</li><li> His Grace the Duke of Ankh, Commander Sir Samuel Vimes is also a key example. He doesn't know much in terms of education (he grew up as a street kid, with all that entails in old Ankh-Morpork), and struggles manfully with his paperwork and other more intellectual duties, but he knows <em>people</em> better than almost anyone else in the setting. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartPeoplePlayChess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartPeoplePlayChess">Smart People Play Chess</a>, he questions why the pawns don't overthrow the nobles and set up a republic.
</li></ul></li><li> The world of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Temeraire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Temeraire">Temeraire</a></em> features several people like this, though it certainly wouldn't be uncommon as public schooling was all but unthought of during the Napoleonic wars. Laurence forced himself to cram the necessary mathematics to be a sailor into his head when he was a boy, but was not much skilled beyond that, and had little love for books. Laurence, though, is not a slow man by any means. However, it's subverted when Temeraire's love of books and joy in reading and knowledge infects Laurence. Laurence also insists that his adolescent ensigns and cadets do their schoolwork, when he's not so busy he forgets, and though they perform their duties ably and, as children and youth are wont to do, pick up languages faster than the adults in the crew, they show great resistance and dislike of it. Similarly, uneducated dragons, even from breeds not particularly renowned for thinking, prove quite capable of debating advanced mathematics with Temeraire. The trope is also inverted in a minor character, a lieutenant who, "If ships could be sailed by figures could sail around the world without fear" but when called to order others around habitually gives the wrong order.
</li><li> Claudia Kishi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBabySittersClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBabySittersClub">The Baby-Sitters Club</a></em> series <em>is</em> this trope. Basically her entire personality, and many of her plotlines, revolve around the fact that she does poorly in school despite being talented at art and having generally good judgment and social skills. In the early books she's just uninterested in school, but she seems to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">get dumber</a> as the series goes on, even going so far as to be sent back to a grade she had <em>already completed</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJackson">Percy Jackson</a> and the Olympians</em> also has several examples of this—most of the demigods are ADHD and dyslexic, which results in their doing rather poorly in school, despite their hyperintelligence in other areas.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>
<ul><li> Both Harry Potter and Ron Weasley have a fairly low level of interest in academia and usually rely on their uber-nerd friend to succeed for them. Everyone knows that Harry Potter becomes a great wizard, yet he's only this great when in danger. He even flat-out says this in the fifth book. Even J.K. Rowling states that while Harry does become a gifted wizard, he was pretty much comparable to Ron as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">The Ditz</a>, especially when one remembers how out of the trio, Harry was the only one to never use a single spell in the first book. Even though he just learned of Hogwarts existence a day before attending, he was certainly given the chance to learn at least one spell throughout the school year, especially given the circumstances. Even Ron learned two spells, and successfully performed one. This is downplayed a bit, in that neither Harry nor Ron are <em>bad</em> at school, just kind of middle-of-the-road, with their grades in a major exam suggesting them to be the wizarding equivalent of B-students.
</li><li> If you thought Harry and Ron were bad academically, Ron's prankster twin brothers, Fred and George, are even worse. Case in point: Mrs. Weasley commented once of Ron achieving seven "Exceeds Expectations" grades in his O.W.L. exams as more than Fred's and George's added together. On the other hand, they managed to found a highly successful joke shop to sell their magical inventions that impress even Hermione. However, they were not always Book Dumb; in the first book, Ron mentioned that they make high grades, despite being goofs. Their grades declined because in the later years of school, they could no longer breeze through exams without even trying. And given their career plans didn't require getting into the advanced classes, it wasn't worth the effort to them to study harder.

</li><li> Vin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mistborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mistborn">Mistborn</a></em> has this to an extent; she's actually pretty good at reading and writing but hates doing them.

It's not clear whether he's legitimately Book Dumb or just plain lazy, as he also claims to hate reading books and never finishes them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GalaxyOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GalaxyOfFear">Galaxy of Fear</a></em> covers its bases. Zak Arranda is reasonably intelligent but hates to study. His big sister Tash is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bookworm">bookworm</a> who likes study and cites her sources when she writes essays - admirable, for a thirteen-year-old.
</li><li> Scarlett O'Hara from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoneWithTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoneWithTheWind">Gone with the Wind</a></em> is mentioned to have barely scraped by at the Fayetteville Female Academy, and never willingly opened a book since her graduation. However, this is purposefully cultivated because intellectual women found it harder to catch husbands in the antebellum South. However, she is highly skilled in wrapping men around her little finger. Melanie, on the other hand, is not afraid to discuss literature and philosophy with her fiance.
<ul><li> Scarlett is also shown to have an instinctual knack for business and uncanny math skills. Frank Kennedy was appalled to find out that she even knew what a mortgage was.

Institutions of higher learning have been eviscerated, and the remaining schools only teach practical or useless classes, meaning that much of the populace is ignorant of history, literature, and civics. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When citizens revolt against the Corpos, this works against them as well as the Corpos.</span>

He also conveniently knows very little about a great many plot points and other miscellaneous details that he <em>should</em> reasonably be expected to know by the standards of his people, because while he has completed his education, he spent most of that education <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy">staring at the attractive female Andalites in adjacent learning cubicles</a>.

This is sharply contrasted with Gideon and Charlotte, who have received intensive education practically since birth in historical knowledge and skills designed to let them fit seamlessly into past eras, but have also been successfully indoctrinated to play their roles in the Guardians without question or complaint and are unprepared for navigating healthy friendships and relationships in their own era.
<div class="indent"> Gwyneth: "If you've been trained for your life as a time traveler only half as thoroughly as Charlotte, then you've had no time to make any friends at all, and your opinion of what you call <em>average</em> girls comes from observations you made when you were standing about the school yard alone.

So much that he considers getting a <em>50</em> his greatest accomplishment! Plus, that 50 was originally an <em>18</em> — due to helping out the detention teacher's son, he bumped it up to the 50 to pass! The other half of this trope is shown in Gentaro's social skills (he's incredibly good with people and can befriend just about anyone, plus is a very good judge of character and when someone is hiding something), his deductive reasoning (figuring out who the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> was based on a character tic), and his ability to learn, adapt, and improvise during battle.

That said, he was a very cunning and successful professional criminal even before he took on this gimmick, thanks to a hefty dose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis">Awesomeness by Analysis</a>, and was the first villain to hand the Flash a solid defeat and remain at large, rather than being killed or captured. He has also taken apart and put back together his cold gun enough times to know how to maintain it, despite the technology being way beyond him. He insists that his partner (who's even more this trope) do the same with his flamethrower. Mick later turns out to be even smarter by being able to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">pilot a timeship and track down temporal fugitives as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BountyHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BountyHunter">Bounty Hunter</a> Chronos</span>. Jefferson "Jax" Jackson never went to college due to a busted knee ruining his chances for a football scholarship. Despite this, his skills as a mechanic translate surprisingly well to maintaining a <em>timeship</em> almost as well as Rip (a trained Time Master).

He has a shockingly poor grasp of just about every academic subject, save for maths where his decades of wheeling and dealing have left him with fantastic mental arithmetic. Despite all this he is an excellent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">Guile Hero</a>, able to outwit people much better educated and successful than himself. One memorable instance involved him confessing to a crime moments after receiving a legally binding declaration that he couldn't be arrested for his involvement with it. His Book Dumb nature means that he is so frequently wrong about things that when he is secretly acting out one of his brilliant plans, even the <em>audience</em> is fooled.

Ezekiel doesn't like to read much and tends to scoff at Jacob's knowledge of art. Despite this, he has incredible street smarts, self-taught skills of getting out of any situation, and knowledge of the criminal underworld. Eve, on the other hand, doesn't need to be book smart, when she has three (sometimes four) Librarians, whose knowledge and skills she knows how to direct, as well a good leader should.

On the surface they look like a bunch of drunken soccer hooligans who can barely stack a couple crates up without smashing them to splinters, but looks can be deceiving. Just because charging at you with an axe held high and a loud bellow on their lips is their favorite tactic, doesn't mean it's all they do. Contrary to popular belief, they do indeed understand the concepts of flanking, high ground, suppressive fire, camouflage, feints, tactical withdrawals, and other such strategies. They have an entire god devoted to "Being Cunning" — specifically, Being <em>Brutally</em> Cunning — so don't let your guard down. Additionally, because of how their version of psi works, choosing not to roll with formal education is actually a very calculated and clever strategic decision. If they built an engineering college for the mekboys so they all understood how engines and aerodynamics work, making their hoverbikes go faster would no longer be as simple as a can of red paint.

<ul><li> Rainbow Dash regularly expresses a strong jock attitude, often misunderstanding complicated words ("Tenacity?" "Gesundheit.") and (initially) fears the stigma of being known as an "egghead" who reads books, but she is a capable weather manager (which fans posit would require extensive academic training). "Testing, Testing, 1-2-3" goes even further, implying that she may have some sort of learning disability (hence her dislike of heavily academic subjects). It also shows that when she's flying, she's capable of processing and remembering large amounts of information very easily. In later seasons, it's shown that her book dumbness was entirely a façade, and the reason she had trouble learning in a classroom was not due to learning disabilities, but because she was bored.

After Book Dumb Osmosis spends the entire episode berating Drix for not having any street smarts to offset his prodigious book smarts, it is ultimately Drix's book smarts that save the day. Ozzy, realizing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">for the last thirty seconds of the episode</a> that book learning can sometimes go a long way, asks Drix to educate him.

<ul><li> Bart Simpson is clearly an excellent example of this — at school, he is falling behind everybody else, barely managing to stay in his own grade, whereas in his spare time he thwarts criminals and solves mysteries, often displaying intuitive thinking skills on a par with his sister Lisa. Further proven in the few situations where he <em>does</em> apply himself academically, and manages to do quite well for himself. He has also proven himself to be an excellent polyglot, speaking fluent French in two months, and Spanish and Japanese in a matter of hours.
</li><li> Ralph Wiggum, despite having a reputation for rather dim fits this to a minor extent. Although he's as Book Dumb as one could possibly get, numerous scenes have been dropped throughout various Simpsoncentric media from the comic, to the series itself that he's possibly creatively gifted.

Despite this problem, he forms <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">very detailed plans</a>, considers complex issues and is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">brilliant manipulator</a>. Despite this, he demonstrates frequent belief in totally ungrounded assumptions (which, given the nature of the South Park 'verse, are sometimes proven <em>true</em>.) An excellent example: in one episode, Cartman is horrified to find <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain">that there are more minorities at the local water park than white people</a> and does a complex series of calculations to determine the population ratios and rate of change.

To basically everyone's surprise, Hank manages to pass every single test they put him through to keep him from joining the organization, and he shows a freakish level of competence in handling dangerous situations. This can be attributed to being raised by resident-badass Brock Samson, and having picked up tricks from his life as a boy adventurer. But that same episode brought up that both Hank and his brother Dean have so little experience living in the real world, they have barely any actual life skills and wouldn't last a week outside the compound.

A poorly educated Chinese man with no electrical training builds complex robots out of stuff from junkyards. His creations are amazing. He is clearly ingenious and clever.
</li><li> A classic real-life example is Dave Thomas, the founder of the Wendy's restaurant chain: ridiculously successful restaurateur, philanthropist, advertising icon and high-school dropout. He finally got his GED in 1993 (at <em>sixty-one</em>, mind) because he thought his success might encourage others to take the wrong lesson and drop out like he did.

The Wright brothers themselves were simple bicycle mechanics who possessed what amounted to only a basic education for that era (which wasn't much).
</li><li> Sammy Davis, Jr., worked in show business his entire life and <em>never attended school</em>.
</li><li> From a study that was quoted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheColbertReport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheColbertReport">The Colbert Report</a></em>: out of all the billionaires in America, 5% come from Harvard while <strong>35%</strong> come from "the college of No College Education". Also keep in mind the percentage of Americans who graduated from Harvard; it's got to be less than six million people.
</li><li> As quoted above, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlbertEinstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlbertEinstein">Albert Einstein</a> supposedly wasn't successful at school, and thus ended up as a clerk in patent office. Fortunately, this gave him plenty of time to daydream, and while Einstein wasn't a particularly fast thinker, he was a very deep one, which in turn led to his discovery of the <em>theory of relativity</em>. This is, in fact, a 100% thoroughly debunked myth (except about the speed/depth of his thoughts—depending on his knowledge of trivia, he might have done very well on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</a></em> but poorly on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy">Jeopardy!</a></em>). Einstein did extremely well in school. Einstein was actually a child mathematics prodigy who was doing both differential and integral calculus by age 12. It is true, however, that he didn't <em>like</em> the then-very-militaristic German schools. The myth may have arisen because the grade rankings in Switzerland (where he was born and went to school) are opposite to the ones in Germany (where he lived later). In Germany, 1 is the best grade, 6 the worst. In Switzerland, 6 is the best and 1 the worst. It could be assumed some Germans heard that Einstein "only" got 6s and came to the wrong conclusion. Also, when he first tried to apply at ETH Zürich (a science and technology university) he did not pass the entrance exam, because it was written in French. He still got exceptional marks in mathematics and physics. The other source of this myth may be the opinion of his teachers, who claimed that young Einstein was often prone to daydreaming and had trouble in focusing. Which is not surprising given that Einstein had already mastered large parts of his curriculum and was simply bored as hell. And one more thing: Einstein was not 'just a clerk in patent office'. He was technical expert tasked with approving patent claims, a job that usually required a doctorate just to apply. He had, however, some "social" problems with some of his teachers. Best known is the case of his private teacher, when he was five years old. The teacher quit after young and irascible Albert threw a chair at her.
</li><li> A similar case with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlanTuring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlanTuring">Alan Turing</a>. The British concept of being "educated" when he was young placed a heavy emphasis on the Classics, literature, history and social sciences. Turing, who was brilliant at mathematics but weaker on these other subjects, was considered too narrowly-focused by the standards of the system. Of course, he went on to be Britain's greatest codebreaker during WWII and also laid the groundwork for modern computing as we know it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasEdison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasEdison">Thomas Edison</a> did poorly during his brief time in grade school as a child—which may have had something to do with undiagnosed hearing loss—yet he became one of the most successful inventors the US has ever known. He invented the phonograph, introduced practical incandescent lighting and power generation, started the first American motion picture company, and developed a system of corporate research and development caught on throughout the world. His mother started homeschooling him when he was about ten; he was a voracious reader and did his own chemistry experiments. His schooling basically ended at age 12 when he started working as a food vendor and newspaper boy on the Great Trunk Railroad, and through a youth spent hustling he learned telegraphy, started patenting inventions, and went into business. His favorite science was chemistry, but he taught himself a little bit of just about everything over the years with the help of an increasingly huge research library. He could never have produced so many inventions or gotten so successful without help from a lot of talented employees, many of whom he hired specifically because they had formal education or specialized knowledge that he lacked. Edison's treatment of rivals and employees who challenged his authority does require scrutiny, and he did more than once lose his dominance in the very industries he had founded by saying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn">It Will Never Catch On</a> to things such as the alternating current power grid and phonograph recording deals with famous artists. That said, nobody can deny that he left his mark on the world and changed innovation from a solitary pursuit into an industry in itself.
</li><li> Especially talented and intelligent children may often receive poor grades for a variety of reasons. Studies have shown that intelligence can manifest in many different ways. For example, a kid with good tactile intelligence might perform poorly in mathematics even if he has an intrinsic understanding of mechanics. Teaching styles often only address certain kinds of intelligence, putting certain children at a disadvantage. Intelligent children with learning disabilities such as dyslexia can also fall behind if their needs are not properly addressed.
<ul><li> Math teachers routinely expect students to show how they reached their answer, and reduce scores if they don't, regardless of how correct the answer is. Gifted students who can work out the answer in their heads see no need for the step-by-step procedure, so they suffer for it. On the other hand, this method of grading really is meant to help out students who aren't too good at math, as showing your work often gets you enough points to pass so as long as you've answered a handful of questions correctly.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> is an example. He was a notoriously bad student and dropped out of school when only 16 years old. Yet rose to seize control of a country and made some considerable headway towards conquering the entire world. As time went on, however, poor decisions and generally degrading sanity <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">caught up with him.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eminem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eminem">Marshall Mathers</a> is an interesting case of this, he hated school and did poorly in it, repeating ninth grade multiple times, but he loved books and read the dictionary front to back multiple times, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">which he says</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyAlwaysKnewThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyAlwaysKnewThat">gave him</a> his incredible skill at rhyming.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CraigFerguson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CraigFerguson">Craig Ferguson</a> dropped out of high school at age 16 and since then has had no formal education. He considers himself an autodidact, having read for pleasure pretty much everything the rest of us are forced to read in school. He is thus incredibly well-read and extremely literate and articulate. He now has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLateLateShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLateLateShow">his own show</a>, a Peabody Award, and two well-received books to his credit. Keep in mind that in the British educational system, leaving school at 16 is equivalent to graduating high school in the U.S. Only those students seeking to move onto university (U.S.: "college") go to school beyond the age of 16, as they study up for their A-levels (exams intended to be used for entry into university).
</li><li> In fact, this trope would partially apply to a majority of people in some countries. For example, studies show that, in France, people who have been reported to have a higher IQ than average (above one standard deviation from the average, meaning approximately superior to 115) are also globally low achievers at school. They have lower ratios of success at the "Baccalauréat" (High School graduating exam), and a higher proportion of them drop school before actually taking the "Baccalauréat". This might or might not be true in other countries as well. This is frequently believed to at least partly stem from the rather rigid and conformity-oriented French education system and the lack of formation of teachers relatively to this matter (although significant changes have been made thanks to governmental initiatives).
</li><li> The late stand-up comedian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MitchHedberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MitchHedberg">Mitch Hedberg</a>. During an interview, he revealed that he lost interest in being book smart around 10th grade and barely graduated with a high school diploma. He also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> it a bit with this great one-liner:

While not academically intelligent, his stand-up routine brings up a great deal of fantastic insights into human interaction and the importance of self-awareness. In his podcast he also points out that his close friend (and fellow podcast member) Tommy Primo was actually put into special ed only because he was too hyperactive to pay attention and was a troublemaker, one time even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TryAndFollow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TryAndFollow">jumping from the second story of the school to escape</a> some teachers. Tommy eventually became a stuntman (among others, doing work on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Titus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Titus">Titus</a></em>) and was asked back to the school for a career fair.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr">Ringo Starr</a> was notoriously uneducated due to years spent in the hospital as a child, but he was far from unintelligent. Besides being an excellent drummer, he had a very quick wit even for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">Beatle</a>.
</li><li> Emperor Akbar, of the Mughal dynasty and the 16th Century India, is known as one of the greatest and most respected rulers that India ever had for several reasons: developing a comprehensive, cohesive and standardized taxation system across India, developing a comprehensive military and bureaucratic organization for his empire, patronage of wit and art and music, love for philosophy and developing his own school of thought, for coopting Hindu elites into his regime (thereby ensuring their loyalty to his dynasty) and for fostering a culture of tolerance and co-existence between Hindus and Muslims (thereby ensuring a degree of social stability). All these things portray a clever, wise and hard-working bookish intellectual, isn't that so? Well, he was known to be illiterate.
<ul><li> Likewise, Charlemagne. He had no education as a child (his father, Pepin "The Short" didn't see the point), but then had a huge Empire basically dropped on him by the Pope. He was functionally illiterate his entire life. His solution was to have books read to him, while he exercised: which is pretty darn clever in itself, given what we now know about the effects of exercise on learning. He was also famous for grilling diplomats about their home countries. He presided over a period that some historians call a "Little Renaissance" in the 8th Century AD, that saw a flowering of the arts on the continent thanks to the political stability imposed by Charlemagne. However, the Karolingian dynasty he founded ended up not lasting very long <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1gu28');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1gu28" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1gu28');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">His empire fractured after the death of his son and successor, Louis the Pious.</span>, and more warfare was to come before the real Renaissance happened. English-language world history books tend not to talk about this period, because Charlemagne's influence didn't extend into England. Charlemagne came up with the Imperial system of weights and measures. While inferior to the later metric system: this was miles better than the systems which had existed previously simply because all the units were intrinsically related to one another and could be applied globally (a pint's a pound the world around). This system was not named for the British Empire, but in fact for the Holy Roman Empire.
</li></ul></li><li> André Masséna, one of the most brilliant commanders of the French Revolution and the First Empire, had little chance of getting any kind of formal education in his childhood (what with being a poor orphan from Nice and having to work as his uncle's soap factory) and only learned to read and write in his late teens. Contrary to other generals of the same era who tried very hard to compensate for their lack of initial schooling by studying hard in their adult life, he never cared much about deepening his culture, instead relying on his instinct to make war.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanleyKubrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanleyKubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a>, one of the most visionary directors of all time (who reportedly had an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobablyHighIQ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobablyHighIQ">Improbably High I.Q.</a> to boot), hated school and got poor grades. He often cut class to go to the movies, and he later criticized the American educational system for failing to provoke critical thought.
</li><li> The infamous <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliomania">bibliomaniac<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Stephen C. Blumberg stole over 23,600 books worth at least 5.3 million dollars from various libraries throughout the United States before being caught in 1990. Ironically, this very literary person (he never tried to sell any of the rare books he stole) was a poor student who struggled to complete high school and only attended six weeks of college before dropping out.
