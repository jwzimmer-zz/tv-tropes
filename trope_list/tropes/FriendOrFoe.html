Sumeragi's love interest died in that battle, too.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em>, the five Gundam pilots start out wary of each other and sometimes end up fighting among themselves after destroying their mutual enemy.

What's more, they witness him and Maxie teaming up and deciding to go to the Cave of Origins together in a stolen submarine. Gabby immediately wants to announce the truth to the rest of the news station, but Ty points out that if their boss was the leader of Team Aqua, it may already be filled with undercover grunts and the two of them wouldn't know who they could trust. Thankfully, in a slight aversion, the two decide to ditch the news station entirely to inform the people they <em>know</em> they can trust: the Gym Leaders.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> sidestories known as MSV, there is a Mobile Suit called the GM Camouf, which was a Zeon MS designed to look like a GM to fool the Federation.

At first it confuses everyone as to why the ship did that, but it turns out that the Nadesico has a learning computer, and still retains information that the UEAF is considered hostile (due to their actions in preventing the ship from going to Mars in earlier episodes). The UEAF attempts to reprogram it, but Ruri disagrees, since formatting the computer would cause it to lose valuable combat data it acquired when they went to Mars. So she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">decides to reprogram it herself</a> with the help of Akito and Seiya to allow the Nadesico to retain its information, while simultaneously erasing the UEAF forces as hostile.

The Autobot Powermasters track down a group of robots who spoiled a town's Christmas festivities, assuming they're Decepticons, and it isn't until Joyride notices the Autobot symbol on the chest he's pounding that they realise their mistake. (The Autobots were just trying to join in the fun but the townspeople all went "Aargh! Giant robots!" anyway.)

Played straight with the Skaven, who as a race of backstabbing ratmen, can fire into melee (with a random chance of hitting friendlies).
</li><li> Many gamers will have a personal story of being toasted by an overeager ally with more fireball radius than he intended. Later versions of the games (especially those with magic-produced kabooms) even start adding abilities that allow true friendly fire; how about a raging inferno, 40 feet across, with built-in 5-foot safe squares in a random pattern?

<ul><li> So, so true in most online shooters. If you never accidentally fired at your teammate, you probably never played a shooter online.
</li><li> This is particularly common in "real world" first-person shooters, particularly WW2 shooters. Often, the only difference between the uniforms worn by the soldiers on your side and those worn by the soldiers on the enemy side are a slight difference in the shade of khaki. In sci-fi shooters, you at least have more flamboyant, easily distinguished uniforms, or the enemy will be outright alien and easy to spot simply by their profile.
<ul><li> Happens so often in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedOrchestra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedOrchestra">Red Orchestra</a></em> to the point that there exists a specific apology message in chat.
</li></ul></li><li> On the other hand, in a few shooters enemies can hurt each other with their attacks, the so-called <a class="urllink" href="http://www.giantbomb.com/monster-infighting/3015-2185/">monster infighting<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> popularized by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em>.
</li><li> Fortunately, many games give you the option of turning Friendly Fire off. Lag and collision detection glitches can also result in team kills while, say, firing on an enemy to assist with a kill if your teammate moves near your line of fire.
<ul><li> Worse in <em>Söldner</em>, where every player could customize his outfit and color, meaning only the teamnames above their heads showed who was on your team. Enter a bug where sometimes a teammate won't have this blue name displayed...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em> has this problem as well — it's surprisingly easy to get the game to not display a teammate's name over his head even as you're staring right at him, though thankfully there's normally no friendly fire. Then you enter Hardcore mode, where friendly fire is enabled, the name-tags are disabled, there's no radar to show teammates' locations unless a UAV or spy plane is in the air, and health is reduced to the point that a single bullet with pretty much anything is an instant kill. Getting kicked from the server for too much accidental teamkilling is not at all uncommon.
<ul><li> Regarding <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em>, the single player campaigns have some of the same problems; the names of allied NPCs are often not displayed if you're not aiming at them or at a distance. The games try to acknowledge the inherent risk by allowing the player to accidentally/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">deliberately</a> wing plot-relevant allies (who will often give a word of warning) or kill the occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirt</a>, but this isn't always consistent; add in some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a>, and you'll probably have a few unnecessary game overs on your hands.

Coalition forces and civilians are present throughout the game, and some missions will require you to make precise strikes on enemy forces in urban areas. Hitting friendlies or civilians <em>will</em> make international news, and damage public opinion of the Coalition. Do it enough, and anti-war protests will happen. Ultimately you'll earn yourself a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver">Non-Standard Game Over</a> as the Coalition is forced to pull out.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1">Fallout</a></em>, you had to take a separate perk to have the computer mark your friends in green. Without it, you had to remember (or, in some cases, guess) who was on your side. Or you could just "check". If the game tells you "Ian", "Tycho", "Katja" or "Dogmeat", chances are good that they are friendly.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em>, while wearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DressingAsTheEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DressingAsTheEnemy">Faction Armor</a>, opposing factions will be hostile to you, regardless of your reputation with them.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fable">Fable</a></em> has a <em>huge</em> problem with this.

For one, those you are escorting are typically tagged as "essential", meaning they can't be killed, only knocked out. Additionally, the AI is a lot more understanding with accidental hits (with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">NPCs</a> just admonishing you for being sloppy, unless you hit them quite a few times in a row). Finally, <em>Oblivion</em> includes a method for yielding to NPCs you've accidentally made hostile.
</li></ul></li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a></em> game had friendly fire enabled.
</li><li> It's quite difficult to avoid hitting fellow survivors in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em> (well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">unless you're the AIs</a>). There's even an achievement for getting through a campaign without any friendly fire incidents.
<ul><li> Because the AI bots fire <em>magic bullets.</em> As of May 2017, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.steampowered.com/status/l4d/">4%<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of the players have acquired the achievement badge for <em>Safety First</em>.

More advanced radar models color-code contacts, making it much easier to determine who is or isn't a legitimate target.
<ul><li> In the main games, for the most part your opponents will be flying ships entirely different from your own side's, so it's easier to tell who's who. This doesn't, however, help too much if your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">wingman</a> flies right into the path of the torpedo you just launched, resulting in an insta-kill of said idiot and everyone else declaring you a traitor, in all but the very first game (where there's no penalty for killing your wingman).
<ul><li> On a related note: during a mission briefing in the original game, one wingman "Maniac" is so much trouble that the player is given permission to shoot him if he gives you too much hassle. There is also a Friend or Foe missile used throughout the series that locks onto targets if it doesn't broadcast the right friendly comm code, however the comm system can get damaged in fights.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Taken to an extreme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>. While it is very easy to see who is friend or foe due to the brightly colored team uniforms, the Spy class has the ability to disguise as any other class and in the process take on the name of another player. As the Spy also has an instantly lethal back-stab attack and it's not always too easy to notice the spies on behavior alone, it has become common to "spy-check". That is, shoot at your own team, preferably at close range. Anyone who dies or starts running, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">IS A SPAH!</a>. This is because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyFireproof" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyFireproof">you can not hurt your own team</a>. The best class for spy-checking is the Pyro, as a quick puff of flame will render both the Spy's disguise and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibilityCloak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibilityCloak">invisibility watch</a> useless. Pyros are in fact expected to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">set fire to anyone and anything</a> in order to find spies, and a Pyro who does not do this will most likely be subject to a spy-check himself.
<ul><li> Averted in the Spy's own "Meet the Spy" video. The Soldier's point-blank shotgun blast would have been a perfectly valid tactic in game, resulting only in a BLU spy annoyed at being interrupted mid-monologue.

The only way for an enemy to attack them without using scouts to break their disguise is to force-attack (explicitly give orders to attack, as units without orders will not engage them).

They don't reply to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrustPassword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrustPassword">code sign</a> by Sgt.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> had friendly fire in co-op mode. Much more famously, any monster with a projectile could incite a riot by accidentally hitting its allies, which would cause them to forget all about the player and kill each other. They don't really notice if one of their buddies wanders into the line of fire. Quite a bit of Doom strategy is based around tricking enemies into hitting each other.

</li><li> Set <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Nightmare</a> difficulty level.

Watch the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">Total Party Kill</a> ensue.
</li><li> Even though friendlies are highlighted green and hostiles red, it's still easy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfTanks">World of Tanks</a></em> to accidentally shoot a friendly, either through people driving through your line of fire, or simply being jumpy and shooting at the tank that suddenly was in your sights.
<ul><li> Artillery is the worst offender due to large blast radius, inaccurate gun, long shell traverse time and fairly low skill requirement. It can be avoided by not sticking to enemy tanks, but it tends to be the easiest way to defeat <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TDs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TDs">T Ds</a> and heavies with a lighter tanks.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ChivalryMedievalWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ChivalryMedievalWarfare">Chivalry: Medieval Warfare</a></em> has serious problems with this, mostly because all battles eventually turn into multi-man melees with archers firing into the fray. And when you swing any sort of weapon into a fray that size, you're eventually going to chop your ally's head off by accident. Archers don't have it any better, and unless you're really good a sizeable portion of your arrows will end up adorning your pals. Even with proper caution taken it's very, very hard to avoid decking someone on your side during any battle bigger than a three-on-two.
</li><li> As per the <em>Chivalry</em> example above, it's also possible to accidentally hit allies with projectile weapons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MountAndBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MountAndBlade">Mount &amp; Blade</a></em>. Don't fire/throw into melee, it's just not going to end well. Fortunately, melee attacks can't harm your allies, though weapon swings will probably bounce off them (similar to swinging at a wall, for instance).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MORDHAU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MORDHAU">MORDHAU</a></em>, being a spiritual successor to <em>Chivalry</em>, would naturally have its share.
<ul><li> In big frays, hitting your teammate because you were swinging a big-ass maul around is basically inevitable if it gets beyond 3 against 1. Stabbing has less possibilities, but not every weapon is good at that, and even <em>then</em> it's perfectly possible for one of your side to get in the way and get shanked to death. And the less said about firing into a massive fray, the better. There's even a perk to reduce friendly fire damage by 50%, which is almost a <em>must</em> for certain builds. And since it also dampens friendly fire that <em>you</em> take, it's still recommended for when you just can't trust your teammates to aim their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">giant sod-off zweihander</a> anywhere that isn't your back. And there's even voicelines for both callign out a teammate for hitting you and apologizing after hitting a teammate, though not all of the latter are friendly...

</div><ul><li> And then there's siege weapons. Ballistae are bad enough, what with how they just keep going until they hit a wall; shooting them into a melee is one way to get a multicolored shishkebab. And catapults and mortars... it's pretty much impossible to <em>not</em> kill one of your guys with a shot unless you're very good or very lucky. Prepare to be literally kicked off the siege engine in question if you do it too much, especially if you wipe out half your team in one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Epic Fail</a> of a shot.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the more embarrassing things to happen to players using howitzers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfTanks">World of Tanks</a></em> is this—because howitzers (including artillery guns) are both hideously inaccurate <em>and</em> devastatingly powerful, there's very few arty players who haven't accidentally teamkilled an ally thanks to the terrible accuracy on their gun.
<ul><li> Alternatively, you could have your sights on an enemy that sat still long enough for your crosshair to lock in a guaranteed direct hit, only for an ally to chase them off <em>after</em> you've fired, then just so happen to stop right in the middle of your aim. Direct hit, ally goes kaboom, see you back at the garage.
</li><li> Light tanks tend to be the biggest receivers of this trope. Not just because of artillery, but because they can be so busy running circles around Tank Destroyers or Heavies, that they aren't paying attention to the guns of their own team-mates. This can result in many cases of Friendly Fire while team mates fire on enemy tanks while unaware that an allied Light Tank is about to come screaming around like a jackrabbit on crack.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarships" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarships">World of Warships</a></em>, Torpedoes are basically addressed "To whom it may concern" as missed torps that haven't sputtered out or hit their intended mark can be just as lethal to an ally, as they can to an enemy. There's even been cases of particularly careless carriers with torpedo bombers sinking <em>themselves</em> with their own torpedoes.
</li></ul></li><li> This can be a bit of a problem in some flight simulators, especially those taking place in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> Middle East. For instance, in <em>F-15 Strike Eagle</em> it is possible to play missions against Iran, who can and will field the American-built F-4 Phantom and F-14 Tomcat. The problem is that, since you play an American strike fighter, your allies are <em>also</em> in Phantoms and Tomcats. Any pilot with a too-itchy trigger finger who doesn't obey the rules of engagement (identify, then engage) will come home to find a nice neat court-martial summons waiting for them.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VichyEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VichyEarth">Vichy Earth</a> would not hesitate to shoot at civilians for the simple crime of not living under their rule.

Some weapons, like the Engineer's Grenade Launcher and <em>especially</em> the Driller's Satchel Charge naturally have more problems, due to explosion radius and the usual panic in which they're tossed out. At least there's perks to mitigate friendly fire damage, though the dwarves themselves will still get pissed.

<ul><li> The rules of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heraldry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heraldry">heraldry</a> exist to avert this trope.
</li><li> It has been estimated that during any particular war since the dawn of the gunpowder era, as much as ten percent of the casualties were the result of this trope.
</li><li> "At least" would be appropriate.

</li><li> During the Battle of Chalons in 451 AD, after the Visigothic King Theodoric had died, the Visigoths and Romans had managed to fight Attila the Hun to a standstill into the night. In the darkness, Thorismund, the new Visigothic king, was nearly killed when he rode toward Hunnic lines thinking they were his own soldiers. Luckily for him, he realized the truth in time and booked it. This was mere hours after his father died. The Visigoths almost lost two kings in a single battle.

This gave rise to cries of treachery (always a possibility in that chaotic period), Lancastrian morale collapsed, and the battle was lost.

</li><li> Confederate general Stonewall Jackson was shot by some of his own men and mortally wounded when they mistook him for a Yankee in the dusk when he returned from a reconnaissance ride late during the battle of Chancellorsville (1863).
<ul><li> This was a real problem for much of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a>. Confederate soldiers in particular tended to wear non-standard uniforms, due to their government generally being less organized and specifically having serious problems supplying the troops. If you didn't have an overcoat you might take one off a dead or captured Yankee. Combine that with poor communications in a pre-radio era and the huge amounts of smoke produced in combat, and the general confusion caused by combat, and Friend Or Foe happened many times.
</li></ul></li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, being shelled by your own side's artillery was such a big and common hazard, that in the German army there was a much-used saying: "Der schlimmste Feind der Infanterie/Das ist die eigene Artillerie" (The worst enemy of the infantry is the own artillery). The fact the general method for attacking enemy positions during the war was closely behind artillery shelling them certainly did not help.
<ul><li> A deliberate version happened on the last day of the war, when one artillery battery kept firing on the Germans despite having been told the armistice had been signed. It took the threat of being fired on by allied artillery to get them to stop shooting.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> also had its share of incidents:
<ul><li> The United States did field tests of the practicality of camouflage uniforms. They took a handful of infantry, fitted them with uniforms, put them on the front and see how things turned out. Well, the Germans were the only ones in the theater that had their infantry use camouflage uniforms in appreciable numbers. With that knowledge and the fact that it's on this page, it shouldn't be surprising that most the infantry involved in the test decided to trade in their experimental uniform for the standard issue.
</li><li> In Antony Beevor's book <em>D-Day: The Battle for Normandy</em> he retells a German joke (from the fighting on the Italian peninsula) made at the expense of the RAF, Luftwaffe, and USAAF —&gt;"If British planes appear, we take cover. If the Luftwaffe appears, nobody takes cover. And if the Americans show up, <em>everyone</em> takes cover."
<ul><li> Bombings by mistake, especially by US aircraft, seeing as there were so many of them, were deadly and common. The highest ranking US general killed in the European Theater of Operations, General <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McNair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McNair">Mc Nair</a>, was killed while visiting the front when his observation post was bombed by B-17s by mistake.
</li></ul></li><li> Units engaged in secret operations under cover were always in danger of being attacked by mistake. The <em>Doggerbank</em>, a formerly British merchant ship used by the German navy for covert operations, was sunk by a U-boat mistaking it for a British ship, with the loss of all but one of the crew.
</li><li> Another awkward case for the Germans occurred in <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Wikinger">Operation Wikinger<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a sortie by the Luftwaffe and the Kriegsmarine as a commerce raid. The problem was that neither detachment was coordinated by a single unified command, on account of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry">Interservice Rivalry</a> and plain old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandVersusLeftHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandVersusLeftHand">Right Hand vs. Left Hand</a> ineptitude. What followed was a case where German destroyers were spotted by German aircraft, who in turn spotted the German bombers. The destroyers fired first, taking the Luftwaffe units as hostiles. Convinced that the vessels beneath them were British ships, the Luftwaffe squadrons proceeded to bomb them. The destroyer <em>Leberecht Maass</em> was hit by a salvo of Luftwaffe bombs and promptly exploded, broke in two, and sank in minutes. In the ensuing mayhem, the destroyer <em>Max Schultz</em> pulled out of formation to avoid the bombers, wandered in a German minefield, and also promptly exploded, this time with no survivors. Fearing that the loss of the <em>Max Schultz</em> was due to a British submarine torpedo attack, the destroyer <em>Theodor Riedel</em> proceeded to fire large numbers of depth charges into the water, which successfully blew up its own rudder. The total loss to the Germans were two destroyers sunk, another damaged, and nearly 600 sailors killed in action, resulting in a decisive British victory. This leads to a rare case of a wartime engagement where one of the belligerent parties was not even present for the battle <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinsByDoingAbsolutelyNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinsByDoingAbsolutelyNothing">and won regardless</a></em>.
</li><li> A very awkward battle from Estonia: As it happened, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were both invaders. While the Soviets forcefully conscripted Estonians in 1939-40 and in 1944-45, the Nazis only took volunteers in 1940-1942 until in 1943 they conscripted every able-bodied male into the SS, leaving the Soviets with just the old men and the kids coming-of-age<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1c0wc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1c0wc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1c0wc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> making these men the only SS men who were not automatically treated with a great deal of suspicion after the war, incidentally, since they were the only conscripts to feature in their fighting formations </span>; either way, there were entire units of Estonians on both sides. During a particularly dark night, one of the Soviet-Estonian companies encountered a Nazi-Estonian company while marching through the forest. Since both sides spoke Estonian, neither unit realized they were marching with the enemy—but when they did, all hell broke loose. Due to low visibility, the soldiers dropped their weapons, grabbed bayonets or knives and then held their weapon in one hand and with the other reached to touch each others' heads under the helmets. This is because the Soviet conscripts had shaven heads while the German army let the volunteers' hair be—so they determined who was friend or foe by haircut. You could say it was the most awkward and largest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeFight">Knife Fight</a> in military history.
</li><li> Operation Husky: 144 C-47s were on approach for a night-time paradrop operation in Sicily but were fired upon first by Allied ships and then ground forces. A German air attack had occurred just minutes before the C-47s were arriving near the island and the naval AA gunners were simply too nervous to think first and shoot later.
</li><li> Operation Bodenplatte: 900 German fighters and fighter-bombers were launched in a surprise attack to destroy allied airfields in the Low Countries. The attack had failed with 300 planes and 237 pilots lost. Many of the casualties were caused by the secretive nature of the operation which resulted in much of the German Army and Navy in not being informed of a German Air Offensive which in turn led to many German AA batteries opening fire on their own planes.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritsWithBattleships" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritsWithBattleships">Royal Navy cruiser HMS ''Sheffield''</a> was subject to this not once, but <em>twice</em> during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. The first time was when she was participating in the hunt for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NazisWithGnarlyWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NazisWithGnarlyWeapons">German battleship ''Bismarck''</a>. A squadron of Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers had been sent to attack the <em>Bismarck</em>, but not been informed of the position of the <em>Sheffield</em>, and attacked the <em>Sheffield</em>. Luckily, the torpedoes had been armed with highly-unreliable magnetic detonators, and most of them exploded prematurely. The second occasion was during the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Barents_Sea">Battle of the Barents Sea<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, when the <em>Sheffield</em> was mistaken for the German cruiser <em>Admiral Hipper</em>...by the two destroyers assigned to escort the <em>Hipper</em>. The <em>Sheffield</em> did not make a similar mistake, and sank one of the German destroyers.
</li><li> The Polish submarine ORP Jastrząb ("Hawk") was escorting an Allied convoy to Murmansk when on May 2, 1942 it was attacked by Allied surface ships. Five crew members were killed and 6 others wounded. The submarine was severely damaged and was scuttled at sea. To this day there is dispute among historians as to who was really at fault for the friendly fire incident.
</li><li> This was a problem during the Warsaw Uprising. Polish fighters would scavenge German weapons and equipment including helmets and clothing. In the chaos of urban fighting it was often hard to tell whether someone running toward you was a German or a fellow resistance fighter dressed in a German camouflage coat.
</li><li> In WW2, there were "natural enemies" that would often attack each other on the flimsiest of excuses. Ships viewed aircraft, submarines, and small torpedo craft as to be shot at until proven otherwise, knowing that their best defense was to engage as early as possible to disrupt an attack. Fighters would view other single-engine aircraft with great suspicion. Submarines thought that anything small with visible guns was an enemy destroyer until it proved otherwise. Torpedo boats tended to see anything that floated as a valid target. Bombers viewed any single engine plane approaching them as a reason to open fire.
</li><li> One issue in air-to-air combat in Europe was that the American P-47 Thunderbolt had a very similar profile to the German Messerschmitt Bf 109, making distinguishing between the two difficult under combat conditions.
</li><li> Operation Cottage: In August of 1943, a combined force of American and Canadian troops launched an invasion of the Japanese-held island of Kiska. However, inaccurate intelligence meant the Allies didn't know that the Japanese had abandoned the island two weeks earlier, and rough terrain and foggy weather led to friendly fire incidents that resulted in 32 soldiers killed and another 50 wounded.
</li><li> The Battle of Los Angeles: In February of 1942, war nerves and a misidentified weather balloon led to US Army anti-aircraft batteries in and around Los Angeles thinking they were under attack by Japanese bombers and firing into the clouds in response. 5 civilians died as an indirect result (3 from car accidents caused by the chaos and 2 from heart attacks), and several buildings and cars were damaged by falling shell fragments.
</li><li> This became an issue given the number of captured Allied tanks and tank destroyers that the Germans made use of. There was also an experiment in modifying Panthers to resemble American M-10 Wolverine tank destroyers, including American-looking paint jobs.
</li></ul></li><li> A number of friendly fire incidents have happened in Afghanistan during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The War on Terror</a>:
<ul><li> American-on-Canadian: The Tarnak Farm incident of April 2002. A U.S. Air National Guard F-16 mistook Canadian Army soldiers for Taliban fighters with anti-aircraft weapons. The farm had previously been used as a firing range by the Taliban, but was now being used by the Canadians for anti-tank and machine gun exercises. Although denied permission to attack by the controlling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceWithAnInternetConnection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceWithAnInternetConnection">AWACS</a>, Major Harry Schmidt believed the soldiers on the ground were targeting his flight leader, and bombed them in response. This cost the lives of four soldiers while wounding eight others.
</li><li> British/American-on-Afghani: During April 2006, British convoy called in an airstrike from American warplanes on Afghanistan police officers, mistaking them for attacking Taliban forces, killing one and wounding twelve. Note that in this case, the U.S. pilots were attacking as specified by the British, and not making an error of judgment of their own.
</li><li> British-on-British: In Sangin Province during August 2006, an RAF Harrier was called in to assist British troops during a firefight with the Taliban. The Harrier strafed the British instead, missing the enemy by 200 meters. This angered Major James Loden of 3 PARA, who called the RAF "Completely incompetent and utterly, utterly useless in protecting ground troops in Afghanistan." Some British paratroopers have even said they prefer American air support to the Royal Air Force.
</li><li> American-on-British: In a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">Poor Communication Kills</a>, one of two American F-15Es called in to support a platoon from 1 R ANGLIAN dropped a bomb on top of the unit, killing three soldiers. The forward air controller in the platoon, Sergeant Mark Perren, was not issued a noise-reduction headset; the platoon was under heavy fire by the Taliban, making it hard to hear radio transmissions. When the F-15E pilot repeated misheard target coordinates for confirmation, Sergeant Perren wound up confirming his own location as the target.
</li><li> British-on-Danish: In Helmand Province during September 2007, British soldiers fired Javelin missiles at a unit of Royal Life Guards, killing two of them. The British soldiers had mistakenly identified the Royal Life Guards' camp as a Taliban hideout, and requested permission to attack. The Royal Life Guards, not realizing <em>they</em> were the ones being targeted, granted permission.
</li><li> Dutch-on-Dutch/Afghani: During January 2008 in the Uruzgan Province, a unit of the Dutch Army attacked a composite group of Dutch and Afghan soldiers that they had mistaken for the Taliban. Two Dutch and two Afghani soldiers were killed before the firefight ended.
</li><li> American-on-British: In January 2008, two Apaches, one British and one American, were called in to support a unit of Grenadier Guards and Afghan forces fighting the Taliban in the Helmand Province. The British Apache opened fire on the Taliban, while the American Apache attacked the Grenadiers. Only one person was wounded. After the incident, a high ranking British Army officer claimed that in contrast to the UK's full-time professional air forces, most American pilots are merely reservists, implying that this is why British-on-American friendly fire incidents never happen.
</li><li> British-on-British: Later that year in July, a British WAH-64 Apache was called in to support a unit from 2 PARA against Taliban fighters. After attacking the Taliban positions, the Apache mistook the 2 PARA unit for more Taliban and opened fire, wounding nine of them.
</li><li> German-on-Afghani: In early 2010, a unit of German soldiers arriving at the scene of an earlier firefight where the Taliban had ambushed a bridge-laying and mine-clearing operation encountered Afghan Army soldiers in civilian vehicles. After the Afghanis ignored an order to stop, the Germans fired on them, killing six of the soldiers.
</li><li> American-on-Pakistani: In November 2011, a joint 150-man U.S. and Afghani unit came under fire and called in an airstrike. Miscommunication between U.S., NATO, and Pakistani forces led to two Pakistani border posts being destroyed, killing 25 Pakistani soldiers.
</li><li> American-on-American: This is what happened to Army Ranger Spc. Pat Tillman in Afghanistan, 2004. Tillman's unit was ambushed and split in two during a patrol and his section moved ahead to get into a better position to provide support. The other part of the unit mistook the Tillman's section for the enemy and fired on them killing tillman and an Afgani soldier. Tillman was also a professional football player, making the situation even more delicate for the U.S. Armed Forces.
</li></ul></li><li> In 1796, Amédée Laharpe, a Swiss general fighting for the French Republic, was mistaken for an enemy officer while conducting a reconnaissance at dusk and killed by his own soldiers. Made even more cruel by the fact that he was condemned to death in his home country for supporting the Revolution, and had to leave everything to serve France.
</li><li> Napoleon's Grand Army included Hanoverian battalions, who wore the same red coat as the English did. Most of the casualties among Hanovrians serving in the Peninsula were caused not by the Spanish, Portuguese or English, but by their French allies mistaking them for English. In particular, General Marbot tells the story of a Hanovrian battalion at Fuentes d'Oñoro sent to defend a vital spot... and shot at by both the English and the French who were sent as reinforcements. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">They held the position for several hours.</a> Similar misfortunes happened to the Saxons whose uniforms looked like those of the Austrian, notably at Wagram.
</li><li> Modern GPS based tech used by US and other infantry is partially to prevent this. Specifically, this is for when infantry calls for artillery support and provides their own position as the place to drop artillery on. This has resulted in many deaths, mostly American (because Americans are known for their heavy use of artillery and airstrikes). Today thanks to the GPS tech, a call for fire will result in a challenge from the artillery group of "That's your position!". In the event that the infantry wants the artillery strike or airstrike on their own position (such as if the enemy is on top of them, or if the infantry is retreating and being pursued by the enemy), they can respond "I know what my fucking position is!"
