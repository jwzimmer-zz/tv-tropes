Often hidden, they can be altered by your in-game behavior and choices. Types of behavior that can change your relationship values include:
</p><p></p><ul><li> The choices you make during gameplay. For example, one character wants you to go outside and inspect the rumbling noise, while another wants you to wait and see what happens. What do you do?
</li><li> A subset of the above, the answers you give to certain questions (often of the "who do you want to go with you?", "do you think the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl">White Magician Girl</a> is cute?", variety).
</li><li> Your actions during battle. For example, healing a character in battle may raise your relationship value with them, while attacking them may lower it.
</li><li> How you allocate party members during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsSplitUpGang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsSplitUpGang">split-up sequences</a>.

Therefore, part of the challenge lies in either allocating your praise equally among all characters, or (more likely) figuring out whose good side is worth getting on and whose isn't. Relationship Values can be frustrating, because what affects your relationship values, and even the existence of Relationship Values themselves, is often not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">alluded to during the game</a>. Furthermore, the player character's actions may affect his relationship with others in unexpected if not nonsensical ways, such as when a character's relationship with the player character is changed despite them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewsTravelsFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewsTravelsFast">not being present</a> when the actions are carried out.
</p><p>The results of having a good or bad relationship value are varied. Common examples include unlocking an alternate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene">cutscene</a>, gaining access to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">different ending</a>, or simple gameplay buffs/bonuses.

Strategy games (notably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourX">4X games</a>) may also have a variation of this, tracking your relations with other factions (and theirs with each other).

Doing missions for one against another would boost your standing with that gang, and turn your target against you. Them being in a triangle of hate results in you usually being able to max out only two of them with the third shooting you on sight.
</li><li> A large part of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV">Grand Theft Auto IV</a></em> is about Relationship Values; both romantic and platonic.

If you help them, then when they see you they might assist you in return, but if you hinder them, they will become more aggressive. There's really no point to hindering them, though, because the PMCs under Liquid will treat you as hostile no matter what you do.
</li><li> This mechanic is fully utilized in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain">Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Venom Snake</a> can alter the Bond level between three of his four <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCompanion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCompanion">Buddies</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Quiet</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanineCompanion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanineCompanion">D-Dog</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHorse">D-Horse</a>; with the <em>exception</em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotBuddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotBuddy">D-Walker</a>). The Bond level can be positively increased by taking a Buddy along for missions, while inflicting any physical harm or dismissing them from duty will obviously worsen their Bond. The Bond level for each Buddy must be maxed out in order to unlock all of their respective abilities and equipment.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Onimusha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Onimusha">Onimusha</a></em> series:

</li><li> It comes back up in a much smaller manner in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OnimushaDawnOfDreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OnimushaDawnOfDreams">fourth game</a>, where Soki having a better relationship with the other members of the party will unlock additional dialogue options and make them willing to craft more items for you in one sitting. However, since you get relationship points every time you go into battle alongside the other party members, and nearly every stage has a secret you will need to revisit with your companions in order to unlock, having a high relationship with everyone is all but inevitable.
</li></ul></li><li> Used to a small extent in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TexMurphy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TexMurphy">Tex Murphy</a></em> game <em>The Pandora Directive,</em> where the player's choices determine whether he ends up with wholesome, lovable Chelsea or scheming Regan.
<ul><li> Though it's really not so much a choice of which girl to end up with as it is a choice of whether to be on the moral or immoral path. Ending up with Chelsea nets you the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a>, whereas pursuing Regan instead gives you a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a> at best.
</li></ul></li><li> Of all games series out there, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors">Dynasty Warriors</a></em> possessed one in its fourth incarnation. Its relationship system kept track of how every single playable officer felt about every other playable officer, strengthening relationships by saving them to encourage them to appear out of nowhere to save the player and weakening relationships by defeating them causing them to spontaneously defend your <em>enemy</em> commanders if they're on the same force; even challenging you to a duel if they <strong>really</strong> hate you.
<ul><li> This relationship concept returned <em>en masse</em> for one of the spinoff franchises, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriorsGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriorsGundam">Dynasty Warriors: Gundam</a> 2. Characters will like you or hate you depending on how you treat them in your missions. Of course, this will affect if they come and reinforce you in certain missions or what licenses you can earn for using other major giant robots in the game. This becomes especially painful when you realize it's necessary to befriend certain annoying characters to <em>actually unlock them to use in the game.</em> Luckily, the game does give you "friendship building levels" to at least try and patch up those problematic character relationships.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0s0tv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0s0tv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0s0tv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It should also be said that this can get downright creepy when some relationships build high enough. Seeing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> Rezin Schnyder of Char's Counterattack actually <em>hit on</em> Athrun Zala of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeedDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeedDestiny">Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny</a></em> becomes kinda creepy after a while.</span>
</li><li> The <em>Empires</em> spin-offs expands on the relationship system, allowing players to forge bonds with other characters. At high enough levels, players can take on other characters as sworn siblings, or even marry another character of opposite gender.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MusouStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MusouStars">Warriors All-Stars</a> has the Regard system. Regard Levels are increased toward the player character by using support abilities during battle, using Musou Rush, activating special events in the Sanctuary, and encountering characters in the hot springs. Different abilities/items will be awarded when reaching certain levels. When two characters have high Regard for each other, they will trigger character-specific events. Regard is split into 5 distinct levels, from lowest to highest: Associate, Acquaintance, Friend, Companion, and Confidant.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OnePiecePirateWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OnePiecePirateWarriors">One Piece spinoffs</a> have Crew Levels in the third installment. These are raised by calling upon support characters during battles, and by racking up KO's during Kizuna Rush mode. Raising these will unlock that character's Gallery entries, such as the model viewer, portraits, voice lines, etc. The crew levels go from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors">Samurai Warriors</a> games have Friendship Levels. In the fourth installment, maxing out Friendship Levels with a character will allow your avatar character to equip that character's weapon type.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemWarriors">Fire Emblem</a> crossover spinoffs feature Supports. You can raise the support level between two characters by pairing them together during battle and slaying enemy captains, or by completing side-missions that they request of you. Raising supports will reward the player with rare items related to those two characters, which can be used to craft skills and blessings. The Support ratings are split into 4 distinct levels: None, C, B, and A/A+. Getting two characters to "C" rating will gift the player with both characters' respective silver materials. A "B" rating will gift the player with both characters' respective gold material. An "A" rating will gift the player with a unique gold material from both characters, which is that character's "Essence", which is needed for other characters to learn that character's personal skill. Some pairs will have an "A+" rating in place of the standard "A" rating. These pairs will trigger a custom, personalized dialogue event between them when the "A+" support rating is obtained.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateExtellaTheUmbralStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateExtellaTheUmbralStar">Fate/Extella: The Umbral Star</a></em>, you have Bond Levels with the servants. Not surprising, given the franchise's visual novel origins. You raise Bond Levels by selecting the correct options in dialogue events and completing side-missions. Reaching certain bond levels will unlock bonuses, such as alternate costumes or gameplay items.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelltaleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelltaleGames">Telltale Games</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a></em>, the decisions Lee makes affect how the other survivors see him. He can earn their respect or disdain, and how they treat him changes accordingly. When Kenny states "<em>No one</em> gets left behind" in the first episode, for instance, he'll add either "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>Especially</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">a good friend</a></span>" or "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Even if he <em>is</em> an asshole</span>" depending on his opinion of you. In the final chapter when you need <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to save Clementine before Lee succumbs to the infection</span>, your relationship values determine how many people will come along. You can have an entire team of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>, get stuck going alone, or anywhere in-between.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Unrest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Unrest">Unrest</a></em> has three meters that track how Friendly, how Respectful and how Fearful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a> are of your character. In addition, their general opinion of you is summed by a one-word description over each bar.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/KatawaShoujo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/KatawaShoujo">Katawa Shoujo</a></em>, relationship values track the player(as Hisao)'s affection with each girl in Act 1. Basically, they're split between Shizune and Lilly/Hanako: if Shizune's is higher, Hisao will go with her, if Lilly and Hanako's are higher he'll have a final choice between the two and get together with that one, and if they're roughly equal he'll get with Rin. To get with Emi he pretty much just needs to choose to try hard during their training, though it's sometimes possible to end with Shizune even after that.

Some of these guys require you to raise your relationship with another guy in addition to them to get their good ending but for others, raising your relationship too much with another guy will get you their bad ending instead.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ComingOutOnTop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ComingOutOnTop">Coming Out On Top</a></em> demo had the option to show the relationship value as a number once you finished the game once. This way, the player can look how high the number goes after a choice to find the best option. And there's of course the fact that every dateable guy has strong preferences (be kind, be sensual, be strict) that considerably raise their value.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTheSecondStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTheSecondStory">Star Ocean: The Second Story</a></em>, every character has a relationship value with <em>every other character</em>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">a multitude of different scenes can play during the ending</a> depending on who you recruited and which character each one of them ended up with.

This also determines who fights alongside a Fayt duplicate in one of the bonus dungeons.

It doesn't determine who he ends up with, but a high enough value shows an extended ending for each character.
</li></ul></li><li> Some of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> games feature the use of relationship values.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> (which popularized the use of relationship values in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPG">RPGs</a>), whoever liked you the most would take you out on a "date" at the Golden Saucer. Many people get Aerith because of her extremely high default affection value towards Cloud, and arbitrary jumps in points for seemingly random events. However, the Tifa date is still rather easy to get, and with enough dedication, Yuffie, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayOption">even Barret</a> can be your suitor.
<ul><li> Your relationship value with Tifa also affects her interaction with Cloud while under the Highwind, prior to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a>. The high affection variant heavily suggests they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreClimaxClimax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreClimaxClimax">did more</a> than just spend the night together, while the low affection doesn't.
</li><li> A more complicated system that took into account Cloud's treatment of the girls/Barret in battle (gaining him points for healing them/Covering them, losing him points for hitting them/having them Cover him, etc) was planned in development, but scrapped for being too confusing to implement. This does lead to some dialogue being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> due to it being impossible to gain enough Affection to trigger the scene without using cheats (specifically, Aeris telling Cloud she hoped he would be jealous when finding out about Zack).
</li></ul></li><li> They had something similar for the prequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore">Crisis Core</a></em>, where the actions taken to find the thief who stole Zack's wallet can lead to a different type of conversation with Aerith. For some reason, having Zack act like a Schmuck and listen to all the unhelpful bystanders earn points on Aerith's affection scale.
<ul><li> In a similar fashion, completing certain side quests would effect how many people joined Zack's fanclub and its final mail message.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>, alternate scenes and dialogue can be accessed depending on who likes you most out of Yuna, Rikku, and Lulu. Perhaps most notably, your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">Relationship Values</a> determines who aids Tidus in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene">cutscene</a> of his ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">overdrive</a>.
<ul><li> Also happens with the male characters, although the varying scenes aren't as plentiful. The snowmobile scene is the most obvious one; Rikku and Lulu are by far the most common options, but it's possible to also get Kimahri or Auron to buddy up with Tidus for that scene.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3qpyx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3qpyx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3qpyx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Wakka, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">still being a racist for the next few hours of gameplay</a>, isn't an option for the snowmobile scene, only the conversation in Guadosalam</span>
</li><li> Yojimbo, one of the optional Aeons, decides its next move based at least partly on the Relationship Value.
</li></ul></li><li> Final Fantasy Agito possibly tops all others to the degree it's compared to a dating sim and you can wind up with multiple girlfriends or boyfriends from the main characters.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Contact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Contact">Contact</a></em>, there are a number of girls that Terry can romance, based on his rank in the dozens of statistics that game has.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Growlanser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Growlanser">Growlanser</a></em> games usually have these integrated in, where they represent the other party member's opinions of their leader.
<ul><li> <em>Growlanser 2</em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">Relationship Values</a> would give the player a choice about who they could spend a day in town with near the end of the game, and could effect the ending on the regular game path (Though they're all but ignored on the two other gameplay branches). One could spend it with any member they wanted so long as their value was high enough, be they male, female, or dog-familiar thing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DotHackGU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DotHackGU">.hack//G.U.</a></em> has an affection system that can be altered through e-mail, cards and gifts. This will allow for better trades and morale boosts for your party members. In addition, (with two notable exceptions) the main character can marry the female characters or become best friends with the male characters at the end of the game assuming their affection is maxed out.
<ul><li> The two exceptions being Natsume, who only views you as a friend, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayOption">Endrance</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegendOfLegaia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegendOfLegaia">Legaia II: Duel Saga</a></em>, certain actions and choices presented to the player affect Lang's relationship with four different girls: Maya, Sharon, Nancy, and Phanta. It is possible to make all four of them fall in love with him, though unfortunately, this has no effect on the ending. It does affect the in-game cutscenes and dialogue, however. The way the player is able to tell how the different romantic relationships are progressing is by going to the fortune teller in Phorchoon Casino and getting a reading for his love life.
</li><li> The later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona">Persona</a></em> games stand out among other examples because the Relationship Values system is an integral part of the game; half the gameplay is leveling up these values (known as Social Links), and it has a huge impact on the other half of the game - the actual dungeon crawling. Even if you wanted to, you can't ignore this aspect of the game, as the fighting would be way, way too hard if you don't have Personas boosted by Social Link points.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> has a system in which you get access to the best Personas if your relation with certain characters (not necessarily party members) is high enough. Your team is a Social Link that levels up automatically, but some members of your party, along with a colorful cast of NPCs, have individual Social Links. Getting all links maxed in one run is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">Bragging Rights Reward</a> and the equivalent of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun">No-Damage Run</a> for the non-combat aspect of the game, but even with a guide, it's still beyond difficult, particularly since the game <em>loves</em> to mess with players by changing your schedule. Did you choose to spend a night boosting a stat instead of pursue a social link? You might as well start over: your school-based Social Links are unavailable for the next two weeks. Have fun figuring out how to level up your base stats quickly enough to <em>initiate</em> certain Social Links while also maxing out the ones available to you. <br/>Additionally, maxing every social link in <em>Persona 3</em> unlocks bonus content and each maxed link yields an otherwise unobtainable item and the benefit of being irreversible. Which means that you need to date several female characters simultaneously in order to finish the link, then do it again with another set of female characters (Playing the <em>Portable</em> remake with a female protagonist allows you to keep your relationships platonic, but you still need to max each social link). The Social Links are one of the game's logic puzzles — what a reasonable person would say and what you need to say to level the link are often not the same. Oh, and one link requires you to be fleeced of 40,000 yen, which <em>hurts</em> if you try to start that link too soon. Social link questions make up almost half of <em>Persona 3</em> boards and are essentially a set of logic puzzles, with each link being its own puzzle. Good luck!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em> does this as well, with the additional option of pursuing either a friendship or a romantic relationship with the female characters (and the Social Link puzzles making more sense than they did in <em>Persona 3</em>). Having a high relationship with your party members can save your neck in battle too, since advancing their link will grant them various combat bonuses like the ability to take a mortal blow for you; if you max out a party member's S-Link, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">their Persona will upgrade to a more powerful form</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em> renames the system as "Confidant" (to fit with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantomThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantomThief">Phantom Thief</a> motif of the game), but it works the same as previous installments. However, now every Confidant gives a special bonus. For example, befriending the weapon store owner gives you discounts and adds new gun modifications to the store, while befriending the shogi player gives you tactical bonuses such as the ability to switch your party members in-battle.
</li></ul></li><li> Most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> games feature a relatively simplified version of this trope, in which your Pokémon either like or dislike you. This "happiness" value affects the damage power of a couple of moves, certain Pokémon will only evolve if they like you enough, and certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a> will give you an item if your lead Pokémon has a high enough happiness rating.
<ul><li> It is worth noting that Frustration, the move that gains more power from a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">lower</a></em> happiness value is much harder to get and use effectively - in most instances you need a Pokémon that hates you to even get the attack, and if you do opt to use it, it will rapidly decrease in effectiveness simply by the fact that <em>doing well</em> with that Pokémon causes your happiness to rise. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCaringPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCaringPotential">Return</a>, which is incredibly easy to get and can only really increase in power unless you're actually trying to bring it down.
</li><li> In the most recent games, your happiness affects whether or not specific Pokémon can learn some rather powerful moves - essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Hyper Beams</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">Fire, Water, and Grass types.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pokémon X and Y</a></em> adds another layer to this in the form of Pokémon Amie, where you can play with your Pokémon to raise their affection for you, which is a separate value from the aforementioned friendship. Raising it provides benefits like increased EXP gain and increased critical/evasion rates. It'll also change the battle dialogue to reflect the bond you've forged with that Pokémon and the Pokémon will start looking back at you while it awaits its commands if likes you enough.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RivieraThePromisedLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RivieraThePromisedLand">Riviera: The Promised Land</a></em>, the ending you get depends on which other party member likes you the most, with a secret ending being reserved for your cat-demon familiar. On the other hand, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that character can't be used for the final battle.</span>
<ul><li> In the PSP remake there's supposedly an ending with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">Ledah</a>. The CG for it has been found and looks completely genuine, but no one's figured out how to <em>get</em> it yet.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomancingSaGa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomancingSaGa">Romancing SaGa</a>: Minstrel Song</em> gives you Relationship Values with <em>the gods</em>. The quests you complete and the choices you make therein affect your favor with the various gods of Mardias, raising the chances of them coming to your aid during battle and influencing your access to certain options, as well as determining which of the three ending quests you can access. (Ironically, it's easy to buy your way into their good graces simply by purchasing spells at their temples for higher prices than normal — in fact, Elore, lord of the gods, is by far the <em>easiest</em> to appease this way, while the evil gods don't <em>have</em> this option and are thus more difficult to earn favor with. Go figure...)
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SakuraWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SakuraWars">Sakura Wars</a></em> games are all about this trope. How the girls feel about you (their commander) explicitly gives them bonuses in combat, and a special team-up attack is available depending on who your relationship is strongest with at a given time.
</li><li> Occurs in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowHearts">Shadow Hearts</a></em> series (at least in the second game). Your characters have "affinity" for one another, which affects how close they stand together in battle.
<ul><li> Affinity between characters generally rise from cutscenes spent together (e.g. high affinity between Kurando and Anastasia, Yuri and Karin...) and performing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack">combination attacks</a> together in battle.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfInnocence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfInnocence">Tales of Innocence</a></em> does both the second and third methods. Relationship values go up based on cutscene dialog choices, and between any two characters at the end of battle if one used a healing or support skill on the other. The game is unusual in two ways: first, the game shows you the numerical values for every decision and at the end of every battle, even letting you check values at any time in the status screen, and relationship values can exist for every pair of the six characters, though only the main character's values affect the ending.
</li><li> Likewise for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em>, although the ending is only marginally different — relationships affect certain in-game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene">cutscenes</a> more. Particularly frustrating because one character (Colette) is noted for her devotion to the main character, and as such, it's difficult to shake her and get a different character to be Lloyd's closest companion. Fortunately, your wanted character can be anywhere in the top 4 highest values, instead of only the highest. You choose which character wins during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSnitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSnitch">Flanoir event</a>, and can simply refuse Colette if you want someone else.
<ul><li> And the real ending is only with Colette, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even though 2 of the other characters, Kratos and Zelos, can fly</span>. The rest are only shards of the epilogue where Lloyd is tacked into someone else's ending, but in the previous dramatic cutscene only shows affection for Colette.
</li><li> This can be avoided by keeping your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">Relationship Values</a> on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>. This means, you can actually force Colette to be second or third on your second play through and have your wanted soulmate on top. If you want to get a certain cutscene with Zelos (that Colette normally speaks during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> involving <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kratos</span>, he must be the second or third person on your first play through before he can be the first. This works for everyone though. If you play the game again after that, you can move Colette further down the line until she's no longer on the top.
</li><li> It's fully possible to get Zelos - the character who starts with the lowest affection for Lloyd - as your soulmate while pushing Colette fairly close to the bottom of the list (low enough to be one of the four characters who leaves Flanoir for the snow conversation segment) on the first playthrough. It's <em>possible,</em> but you have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">answer every question in the game in a way that angers Colette and pleases Zelos, with no indications or hints as to what you should pick, pursue some sidequests and not others at certain times, keep Zelos in your party every time, find all of his skits,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">and get at least one of his optional costumes.</a> This means it's also possible to get any character as your soulmate on the first try, and always possible to bump Colette off the list - you just have to know what to pick in advance.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VanguardBandits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VanguardBandits">Vanguard Bandits</a></em> had its characters' relationship values towards Bastion based largely on two things: how the characters did in combat (getting defeated cost them), and who you chose to talk to between fights. What these meant, plotwise, depended on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">story path</a> you were on: in the Kingdom path, you needed the average amount above a certain total to avoid the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a> Bad Ending; the Empire path resembled a two-girl dating game, and the one with the higher relationship value would end up with Bastion at the end; and the Ruin path (which had only one ending) didn't care a whit for them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou">The World Ends with You</a></em> has two much different than usual values. There's synchronization, a percentage that affects your partner's performance in battle which resets every day, is increased by feeding them food, and goes down when you flee from battle. Then there's your friendship gauge with shop owners, which you increase by spending money at their store and unlocks items' abilities (as well as making their dialogue much friendlier).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RadiataStories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RadiataStories">Radiata Stories</a></em> has this, although it's nearly impossible to figure out. All female party members (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsandLoadsofCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsandLoadsofCharacters">of which there are many</a>) can get a short scene during a festival late in the game where they watch fireworks with Jack. This character <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> will also be seen following Jack out of town in the human side ending, implying they plan on leaving with him.</span> If you choose the non-human side, then it affects nothing, as Jack's love interest will then become Ridley.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters">The King of Fighters</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters">The King of Fighters</a>: KYO", the player (as Kyo Kusanagi) must not only travel around the world and interact with all kind of characters, but recruit two partners for the KOF tournament. Since Kyo is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> in canon, this isn't necessarily easy, and thus the player must have Kyo solve sidequests and do small-to-big favors for them among other things. i.e to have Benimaru as a teammate Kyo must allow himself to lose a battle in public <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenPreferStrongMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenPreferStrongMen">so Benimaru can woo a cute girl who likes strong men</a>, to gain Yuri's partnership Kyo must take her side when during a discussion with her older brother Ryo and his father Takuma (and not doing so strengthens Kyo's bonds with Ryo instead), etc.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade">Xenoblade</a></em> uses a variation. The game keeps track of each party member's "affinity" with the others, doing things like helping them out in battle or performing sidequests together can increase the relationship. Once it reaches certain values, you have the option to view "Heart-to-Heart" events between the two, potentially increasing their relationship even more. Interestingly enough, this only really affects gameplay: characters can learn skills off those they have a high affinity with, make better gems while crafting and get slight boosts in battle.
<ul><li> The NPCs in the game also have affinity values with each other, which can be strengthened or damaged based on your choices during sidequests (such as how you resolve an NPC <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a>, for example). These don't really do much, though, aside from providing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCaringPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCaringPotential">Videogame Caring Potential</a>.

Increasing a party member's affinity is necessary to access their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoyaltyMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoyaltyMission">Affinity Missions</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a></em>:

However, most Blades require a high Trust to reach the better rungs of their tree. In addition to granting access to their better skill nodes, Trust also increases the speed at which you can use Blade Combos.
</li><li> There is a <em>very</em> minor one for the Rex and Pyra/Mythra relationship. When Pyra and Mythra obtain their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a>, Rex asks what he should call them. You get to decide whether to use Pyra or Mythra's name, which changes the voice clip used for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> for the rest of the game. Then at the very end, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pyra and Mythra have been revived from their core in separate bodies, the one you chose mouths "I love you, Rex" as the game ends</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Neptunia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Neptunia">Neptunia</a></em> series has these, and given the cast is nearly entirely female, it terms them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">Lily Points</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperdimensionNeptuniaMk2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperdimensionNeptuniaMk2">Hyperdimension Neptunia mk2</a></em> merely had every party member have a ranking with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Nepgear</a>, while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperdimensionNeptuniaVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperdimensionNeptuniaVictory">Victory</a></em> and later has a Lily rank between every possible pair of your party members. Some of the more frustrating trophies to get require you to max out all of them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Opoona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Opoona">Opoona</a>,</em> you can befriend certain NPCs. Each "friendable" NPC has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SidequestSidestory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SidequestSidestory">their own story associated with them</a>, and by doing events to advance their stories, you can increase your friendship with them. Near the end of the game, you'll need to gather up a number of your friends with a high affection in order for their help in storming the final dungeon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CIMATheEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CIMATheEnemy">CIMA: The Enemy</a></em> features this for the various settlers that you have to protect, which increases if you kill monsters in their presence and decreases when they take damage. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouLoseAtZeroTrust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouLoseAtZeroTrust">Having a negative value means that the settler won't be able to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting">craft items</a> for you (and an event happens early on that puts this value into the negatives for <em>every</em> character, forcing the player to regain their trust.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lunarosse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lunarosse">Lunarosse</a></em> lets you manage your relationships with Gloria and Noel. You can earn up to three points with each, at which they get a new move. Generally not too hard to get, as long as you treat them both and listen to the in-game hint on how to do so during the winter dance. The tricky part is that if you don't get make the right choice after the boss battle in the underwater temple, you can easily screw up and not be able to get the one point you need to ensure they both max out. And that's before the relationship values are even introduced to you.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RakenzarnTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RakenzarnTales">Rakenzarn Tales</a></em> lets you pursue romantic relationships with up to 15 girls, depending on your route choices. These relationships have a maximum level of seven, with special events preceding each level increase. However, maxing out a relationship with a girls makes it exclusive, so you can't date the other girls further after that.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomancingWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomancingWalker">Romancing Walker</a></em>, Ryle's attraction with his female companions increases when she fights alongside him (i.e. serve as an active party member) for a long enough period of time. Having a high enough points would also unlock events that would further deepen Ryle's relationship with the girl of his choice. The girl with the highest attraction would end up with him in the epilogue.
</li><li> Starting from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea2">Disgaea 2</a></em>, fighting alongside characters offered an increasing variety of benefits (increased chance of combo attacks, special endings, etc.), and in <em>Disgaea 2</em> is specifically used as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryAndGameplayIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryAndGameplayIntegration">Story And Gameplay Integration</a> to track the progression of Adell and Rozalin's relationship.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaD2ABrighterDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaD2ABrighterDarkness">Disgaea D2: A Brighter Darkness</a></em> makes use of this through its Likability mechanic. The higher two characters' Likability ratings are, the more often they will activate Cover (taking an attack for) and Support Attacks (follow-up attacks) with each other on the field. At maximum likability, one can even earn the other's passive ability. That said, there is the "Heart's Shadow" Innocent that gives a stat boost per person with Zero likability with the holder, and these ratings can be raised / lowered at the Dark Assembly.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Miitopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Miitopia">Miitopia</a></em>, party members can form bonds with one another, which will then lead to them aiding one another in battle in various ways. These can be formed gradually by having characters room together at the inn between levels, but bonding scenes can also happen at random either at inns or during levels, and in-battle actions can also bring people closer. Conversely, characters can be angered by others' behavior, but rather than actively lowering the relationship values it freezes them in place and replaces the positive in-battle actions with negative ones until the quarrel's over.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WizardryTaleOfTheForsakenLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WizardryTaleOfTheForsakenLand">Wizardry: Tale of the Forsaken Land</a></em> once your party becomes a team you gain a trust score representing how much your party trusts you as a leader. Each character aside from the party leader has their own individual trust meter which can go up or down based on your actions and their personality. High trust levels allow you to perform powerful combination techniques.
</li><li> Both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeroNoKiseki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeroNoKiseki">The Legend of Heroes: Zero no Kiseki</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsOfColdSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsOfColdSteel">The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel</a></em> have events that allow players to hang out with the other characters. Before the final chapter of the game, they get to hang out with the character they've maxed out their relationship with and get their ending. In <em>Cold Steel IV</em>, maxing out a character's bonding point <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">at Mishelam Wonderland</span> has them giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Rean</a> an accessory that's only exclusive for him to equip. If the character is female and the player has done their romantic events, then players get to watch the fireworks with said girl and ends up kissing them, unless they're minors then he doesn't.

Examples include:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AnalogueAHateStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AnalogueAHateStory">Analogue: A Hate Story</a></em> has the AI constructs keep track of how you treat them and how well your opinions matches theirs.

<ul><li> This continues in the sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HatePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HatePlus">Hate Plus</a></em>, but due to the low number of chances to change them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus">the imported save</a> is generally controlling the values.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Cinders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Cinders">Cinders</a></em> tracks the eponymous character's relationship values with not only her obvious male love interests but with her stepfamily too. If Cinders takes the time to improve her relationships with her stepsisters, they'll have friendlier dialogue with her and cover up for her when she sneaks out of the house. Similarly, if she makes a good impression on her stepmother Carmosa, she can opt to retake her father's manor by impressing Carmosa enough that she steps down to let Cinders manage the household which makes for a much less risky solution than having her arrested or killed off.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc">Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc</a></em> there's an option named "Free Time", which gives the-player-as-Naegi the chance to hang out with the other students and give them presents. They'll reward him either with skills to be used during trial scenes, or by raising the maximum number of skill points Naegi has during trials, depending on how far he's progressed in hanging out with them. (Not to mention, some show quite a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Hidden Depths</a> as well.)
<ul><li> The downside to this, however, is that there's a limited number of "free time segments" in each chapter. When students get killed, they are no longer available to spend time with, and their skills cannot be acquired. Furthermore, even if they're still alive, some characters may be unavailable to spend time with for plot reasons. Fortunately, skills and free time progress both carry over on subsequent playthroughs.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em> performs a relationship values check in all three routes. In Fate, if you-as-Shirou are too much of a jerk to Saber, she basically kills you in a moment of absentmindedness to get the Grail (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourBadEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourBadEnding">this practically requires a conscious effort to get</a>). UBW has Tohsaka leaving you to be killed by Archer while she goes ahead without you to stop Caster (also very difficult to get). HF has the Shadow eating you if Sakura isn't attached enough, Illya will also come after you if you don't meet her a few days earlier in the route, and if you choose not to unseal Archer's arm, Shirou will stab Sakura (and get killed by Rider) much further down the route (all of whom can easily happen if you're not careful). All of these, needless to say, are bad ends that kill you. You get scolded for these in the Tiger Dojo, especially the first.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a></em> also has a relationship values check in all of the routes, though Akiha's and Kohaku's routes are the only ones whose endings aren't determined by it. In Arcueid's route, she'll kill you if your relationship value is low (this can easily happen if you choose to rape her in your craze, which greatly lowers your value and happens right before the check). At the end of Akiha's route, Shiki puts her down if the check fails, which is still considered a Bad End in spite of Shiki living. Generally, having a good relationship with the main heroine of the route nets you the True Ending.

If you side with Chloe on at least three of them, then in the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sacrifice Chloe</span> ending the two will share a passionate kiss.

The more flirty you are with her, the more flirty she is back, culminating in the school play where (if you complete the play perfectly) Rachel will improv <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a proposal on stage</span>, and later Chloe and Rachel can have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigDamnKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigDamnKiss">The Big Damn Kiss</a>.

Not all of the characters you can interact with have sliders for all four values... although the presence or absence of the Romance slider shouldn't always be taken at face value.

The first game has this as a largely optional system that doesn't affect your chances of getting the best ending and just tells you after you get an ending which character you made the happiest, but the second game requires you to have a positive relationship with pretty much every character to get the best ending and shows you a bonus drawing if you got max affection for everyone. The third game goes back to a more relaxed approach with the relationship values; it's fully possible to get the best ending with negative affection with everyone as long as you don't cross the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>, but getting the best ending with everyone's affection maxed out unlocks a bonus drawing similar to the second game's and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourBadEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourBadEnding">getting the worst ending with everyone's affection in the deep negatives</a> unlocks a bonus epilogue after the ending screen.

<ul><li> An in-universe example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/MegaTokyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/MegaTokyo">MegaTokyo</a></em>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG">MMORPG</a> Piro and Miho used to play had a hidden relationship spec. Miho worked it out, and was exploiting it to gain influence over everyone's character. The reason she took an interest in Piro's (female) character was because she was able to get Miho's (male) character to fall in love with her, and Miho powerless to stop it. Miho eventually took advantage of her mass control, causing player's characters to act contrary to their wishes, stopped only by Piro permanently killing her character in game.
</li><li> A non-video game example exists in fanfiction that uses elements from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/TheGamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/TheGamer">The Gamer</a></em>. Because the main characters live their life as though they're in a game, certain actions they take increases this. While this is present in the source material, it's less prevalent than in Gamer fanfiction.
</li><li> Lampshaded in the flash game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/LevelUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/LevelUp">Level Up</a></em>, where the codex even states "Yes, we're so cynical that we rank your relationship"
</li><li> The Yu-Gi-Oh! Tag Force Series, starting from the Second Game, uses a heart system that gradually increaces through winning duels, giving your partner their favourite foods, etc. Whenever a heart is fully filled, it starts a storyline event the following day.
<ul><li> In Tag Force 4, however, although the heart system used in the previous two games still exists, you arn't forced to pick one person to tag team with until you finish their particular storyline. Instead, Each day you can talk to and give items to diffrent characters and eventually choose them as your partner if you ask them. If you ask to partner up with a character when they have 2-and-a-half hearts or more, it is the only time they will ask you to edit their deck (otherwise you have to ask an NPC to force them to let you for the price of a hefty 10,000DP).
</li><li> This can be a double edged sword, however, as certain characters may/may not like who you're teamed up with. To use this to your advantage, you must have an in-depth knowledge of the Anime in question (either GX or 5Ds). Some are readily understood (The Twins Rua and Ruka will be more responsive and happy if you bring the other along as a partner, bringing a Signer/Dark Signer will cause their counterpart to be less responsive) whilst some not (the unnamed characters in <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TF4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TF4">TF 4</a> are on edge if you bring along Aki, 'Marked' characters will cause City and Tops residents to be less responsive, Misty and Carly respond well when one of them's your partner, etc.) Anime knowledge also helps in choosing the gifts you give to certain characters (Jack will reach a full yellow heart when you give him coffee or a crown, Ruka responds well to stuffed animals, Yusei with Milk, Hair Gel and gadgets, Sherry with hair-care products, Carly with fortune-telling equipment, and Aki with tea and fashion accessories)
<ul><li> In <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TF5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TF5">TF 5</a>, even NPCs will have different reactions depending on who you bring. (Prominent Examples are Zora's expression and dialogue when you tag up with Yusei, and Stephanie giving more chances of a good meal (I.e. His favorite: Blue-Eyes Mountain coffee) when you bring Jack).
</li><li> The shop NPC has a "Pseudo-relationship value" that involves the "figurine" items you get in the gift vending machine. Simply enter the card shop with one of five "gold figurines" (I.e. Card Excluder/Ejector, Cyber Tutu, Ebon Macigian Curran, White Magician Pikeru, and Dark Magician Girl) and he will ask you to give it to him in exchange for a 5% discount on every pack. If you give him all 5, you will unlock a new pack along with 50% discount on all packs (including the unlocked one).
</li></ul></li><li> Relationship Values become even more important during tag duels in <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TF4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TF4">TF 4</a>, as now you cannot see your Partner's hand when it's their turn and with the addition of the new feature "Partner Synchro" that allows you to tell your opponent one move (either activate a certain card in play (hand, field grave) or summon a monster, they will continue the rest). The "relationship bubble" (the picture floating over their head or next to their picture) will effect just what you can see in their hand (the anime vein and skull warrant completely blanked-out cards, the ellipsis (...) shows you only the card frame (name, picture and effect are blanked), the musical note provides the card picture and effect (but not the name) and the full heart provides the full card).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InazumaEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InazumaEleven">Inazuma Eleven</a> Strikers</em> for Wii has every character build up "kizuna" (literally "bond") values with each other from 0% to 100% as those characters practice together or participate in a same soccer match. The higher the relationship value, the better they perform. Some characters access secret skills and combinations through this process as well.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></em> each of your companions have a relationship meter with you that can be increased through selecting the right dialogue options while they're around, or just bribing them with gifts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken">Tekken</a></em> has this in the way the characters react to each other and cooperate as a team, as well as affecting win poses. It's a little around the place but makes the game worth playing to see the different combinations.
</li><li> Every character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DokiDokiUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DokiDokiUniverse">Doki-Doki Universe</a></em> has a meter that tells you how much they like or hate you, which you can influence by summoning things they like or hate, or by picking them up and throwing them around.
</li><li> All idol cards in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TokyoSeventhSisters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TokyoSeventhSisters">Tokyo 7th Sisters</a></em> have intimacy values, which has a higher requirement for rarer cards. Maxing out intimacy for any idol cards give a stat boost on them. Doing the same on idolized cards of silver rarity and above gives Seven Coins, this game's in-app purchase currency and unlocks intimacy scenarios, in which the idols get personally close to you.
</li><li> Evolving members in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EightBeatStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EightBeatStory">8 Beat Story</a></em> requires maxing out intimacy values first. Repeating the process after the members have evolved increases said member's stat.

However, the very next mission you and her have a falling-out, the gauge goes so far into the negative it <em>explodes</em> and reads "ENEMIES" instead, and gauge never appears again with there being absolutely nothing you can do to influence relationship values with any character in the rest of the game. It makes sense, after all; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">the gauge blew up</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing">Animal Crossing</a></em>, for almost the same reasons as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon">Harvest Moon</a></em>. But animal neighbors never actually commit to anything, so instead of anything related to marriage, they just give you a framed photo of themselves once you max out their friendship.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freelancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freelancer">Freelancer</a></em> has Relationship Values for every in-game faction. The more jobs you do for them, the higher the respect they hold for you; the more jobs you do for their rivals, the more they will hate you. If you push enough towards one side, that faction will become your friend or enemy. You can also pay for having a good word put upon you at any space station.
</li><li> Used heavily in many of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon">Harvest Moon</a></em> video games. Some of the bachelor(ette)s have these, usually in the form of hearts, that tell you how much they love you. Once you get them to a certain level, you can then use the Blue Feather (HM's equivalent of a wedding ring) to propose to them.
<ul><li> The animals have it as well. The higher the relationship level is with them (and, in relationship to this, how good care you take of them), the better produce they provide. In <em>Magical Melody</em>, your relationship level with your horse determines what race you can enter for the Horseracing Festival, which means that you have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">actively neglect and upset your horse</a> if you want to keep at the necessary relationship level for certain races.
</li></ul></li><li> Employed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory">Rune Factory</a></em>, just like with its sister series <em>Harvest Moon</em>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LionheadStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LionheadStudios">Lionhead Studios</a> tycoon game <em>The Movies</em> tracks relationships between actors and directors. Closer relationships between co-stars and directors give a slight (but not deal-making) boost to individual movies. Slightly related is the mood-tracking concept that The Movies shares with just about any personal-scope (Sims-style) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimulationGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimulationGame">Simulation Game</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrincessMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrincessMaker">Princess Maker</a> 2</em>, some particular meetings and your adoptive Daughter's stats will determine who will she marry. This includes unnamed males of more-or-less high status, a young Dragon, your lovely demon butler, the Prince of the Realm, a nobleman, a local tycoon, a normal man who may leave her in the end, the Demon Lord (who she kills and then steals his power)... or even yourself. Hey, she's your <em>adoptive</em> kid...
<ul><li> The <em>Princess Maker</em> games in general are notable for this, especially since all Relationship Values are completely invisible, and there's no real way to influence them, besides indirectly. The only one that's easy to predict is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry">Wife Husbandry</a> ending, because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingdingEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingdingEyes">sparkly eyes</a> your daughter's drawn with whenever she qualifies for it.
</li></ul></li><li> All versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims">The Sims</a></em> have this as a central aspect of the game. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">Relationship Values</a> are visible for player-controlled characters, but there are also more minimal visual indicators for NPCs; icons will appear over the characters' heads when they become friends, best friends, enemies etc. Having a certain number of friends can be a requirement for getting a job promotion, or a goal unto itself.
<ul><li> In the original game, one expansion added a long-term relationship meter to go with the usual short-term meter, with the icons then reflecting long-term changes over short-term ones.
</li><li> There are also situations that have temporary relationship values; you don't have to stay friends with the person, just get them to like you a certain amount in a time limit, such as trying to impress the Headmaster so your kid can go to private school.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSimsMedieval" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSimsMedieval">The Sims Medieval</a></em> still has the friendship values between individuals, and adds a Popularity meter for your monarch and for the two religious leaders. Unfortunately, the one for the monarch is unseen (you only get popups that it's increased or decreased) and has <em>virtually no</em> effect on gameplay. Having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating">0% Approval Rating</a> doesn't change your Aspects nearly as much as quests do, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">feel free to rudely deny every petition put before you.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander">Wing Commander</a> III</em> and <em>Wing Commander IV</em> allowed you to affect your pilots' attitudes, and thus their combat efficacy, in cutscenes. WC4 took it another step by putting you in situations where you had to choose <em>which</em> person to be nice to, and thus which one would take the relationship hit. Thankfully, the games were easy enough to make your wingmen irrelevant.
<ul><li> Also, in WC3, in a romance subplot you (as Col. Christopher Blair) were given a choice between the ship's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench">chief tech</a> and a pilot under your command. Choosing one made the other unavailable afterward (no Rachel meant you had to configure your own ship loadout, or else you'd launch with no missiles, whereas no Flint just means one less pilot to select for the final mission set), or you could choose neither and make both a little less pleased with you, but keep both of them around.
</li></ul></li><li> Sims in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MySims" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MySims">MySims</a></em> have a friend meter. It starts at Acquaintance, then goes through Friend up to Best Friend as you give them things they like and Be Nice to them. When you achieve Best Friend status with a particular Sim, you are rewarded: Townies give you special blueprints, while Commercial Sims give you duplicates of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes">outfits</a>.
</li><li> All the villagers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StardewValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StardewValley">Stardew Valley</a></em> have a relationship meter expressed in hearts, up to a maximum of ten. A few of them will send you gifts or teach you a new cooking recipe if you get their relationship level high enough. You'll also sometimes unlock cutscenes which give them a bit more characterization and/or can affect your relationship with them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceSidequest">Villagers who can be romanced</a> will have their relationship meter capped at eight hearts until you get it high enough and give them a bouquet, and from there you can give them a mermaid pendant to propose marriage once you get them to relationship level ten.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKings">Crusader Kings</a></em> keeps track of all sorts of relations between characters. First of all between rulers and characters in their courts (a "loyalty" ranking) then for rulers and their vassals, then relations BETWEEN vassals and between rulers and other rulers. Mess things up too much and you can have your empire implode. All of these traits are based on a multitude of factors (prestige, piety, badboy score...) including your character traits (skeptical and zealous characters do not get along) some of the worst traits in the game ("Heretic", "Excommunicated" and "Kinslayer") has the effect of turning you into a real pariah...
<ul><li> In the sequel, these are scrapped and replaced with a new system wherein every character has an opinion of <em>every other character</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourX">4X</a> Strategy games such as the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MasterOfOrion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MasterOfOrion">Master of Orion</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a></em> series are won or lost by your relations with your neighbors — or at least by your ability to placate them until you can get around to properly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">crushing them under your heel</a>.
<ul><li> Also, in some of those games, you can win Diplomatic or Alliance victories by having extremely high <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">Relationship Values</a> with all the factions that you haven't converted to smoldering piles of rubble.
</li><li> On anything but the easiest difficulty levels, it's pretty much impossible to keep the other civilizations happy with you. As soon as you become even moderately successful, they will start plotting to bring you down. Of course, if you have a Democracy, it often behooves you to get your relationship values as low as possible, so that the other civilizations will attack you, eliminating the need to get permission from your Senate to declare war. And there also seems to be a hidden relationship value as far as how your Senate feels about the other civilizations. If it goes low enough, you can declare war on the other civilizations, and your Senate will just look the other way.
</li><li> <em>Rise and Fall</em>, the second expansion to <em>VI</em> adds one for each city, which represents the city's loyalty to their civilzation. The loyalty effects the countries growth rates and yields and can be increased or decreased through various ways, including population pressure, city happiness, and domestic and foreign governor pressure. If loyalty gets too low, then the city will flip to a free state, who are against everyone. These free states can be taken by anyone, either forcibly or through loyalty. A leader from the third expansion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EleanorOfAquitaine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EleanorOfAquitaine">Eleanor Of Aquitaine</a>, has this as her main mechanic, allowing her to use Great Works to flip cities and skipp the free city state when doing so.
</li></ul></li><li> The RTS <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SevenKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SevenKingdoms">Seven Kingdoms</a></em> also have a wealth of diplomacy options with other kingdoms. Unfortunately, the AI tends to be on the aggressive side and will become a sworn enemy if you do as much as build a fort in reach of one of its cities. Or reject their request to declare war on another AI kingdom that probably hasn't done much worse than that to anger them. However, there is still a benefit in forging alliances, and breaking them damages a kingdom's reputation. A surefire way to set their relationship value to 0 and thereby declaring a war themselves? Capturing their fort with spies, it doesn't matter if beforehand you're best buds for life, do it and they declare hatred on you. The second game makes these values visible in the Kingdom tab, so you can adjust fairly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2">XCOM 2</a></em> uses this when you're looking around the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship">Avenger</a></em>. Your soldiers will be palling it up in the barracks or sitting next to each other in the bar, but not arbitrarily - the game keeps track of who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGotYouCovered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGotYouCovered">shot down an enemy that had flanked a friendly soldier</a>, or who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlorenceNightingaleEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlorenceNightingaleEffect">healed another soldier with a medkit</a>, and factors this in to what in the vanilla game is a hidden relationship stat. The <em>War of the Chosen</em> expansion lets you see the affinity between your soldiers, even assigns them compatibility values, and if their relationship develops far enough you can make them "Bonded," unlocking special abilities and bonuses when they take to the field together.

<ul><li> The support conversations of the later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> series work this way. Characters who spend a lot of time in battle together can improve their relationship, and will receive statistical bonuses whenever they're near each other on the field. Certain preset combinations change the ending, with the supporting characters getting married or otherwise pursuing their relationship:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemJugdral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemJugdral">Genealogy of the Holy War</a></em>, relationship values are determined by how many turns a man and a woman stand together. Whoever reaches 500 relationship points with a woman first becomes her spouse <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and the father of her children in the next half</span>. Values are also determined by whether or not the pairings are "predestined;" each female comes with three men as her default love interests, and building relations with them takes less time than building them with others (example: Lewyn/Erinys is one of the fastest pairings in the game and can happen in a chapter's span (and a certain talk can make them <em>fall in love instantly</em>), while pairing Erinys with Claud takes forever).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemElibe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemElibe">Binding Blade</a></em>, only the main character Roy can have paired endings, and only characters who went to the final battle (the <em>real</em> final battle, that is) get more than a simple line of text stating what happened to them after the war. Its prequel <em>Blazing Blade</em> and the following game, <em>Sacred Stones</em> also has the same system, but multiple characters have paired endings, depending on who the player has them end up with.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Awakening</a></em> has a similar system as <em>Genealogy of the Holy War</em>, in that when a male and female reach the 'S' Support level they become committed/married to one another, which gives more stat bonuses when the two are paired up in battle. Depending on the female, they may produce a child who inherits skills, re-classing options, and statistical values from both parents. Although even those that don't have children still can reach 'S' rank.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fates</a></em> has pretty much the same system as <em>Awakening</em> for all three games, with characters being able to support, marry, and have children. The main difference here is that children are now locked to their fathers instead of their mothers, with the only exceptions being Azura's son Shigure and the Female Avatar's son Kanna. An A+ rank has also been added in some cases, and achieving A+ or S support ranks allows characters to share classes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses">Three Houses</a></em> retains mostly the same system as in the previous two games, however there are more methods to raising support levels than simply battling. It is also possible to <em>lose</em> support points by choosing wrong dialogue options. Unlike the previous two games, only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Byleth</a> can reach S support, and not until the end of the game, though endings will still mention possible relationships between characters if they reach A rank.
</li></ul></li><li> Interesting example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaPucelle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaPucelle">La Pucelle: Tactics</a></em>, in which any monster you convert to your side has a visible friendliness meter. Training them causes it to drop, and being nice to them causes it to rise. If it hits 0, the monster leaves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLongAndThanksForAllTheGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLongAndThanksForAllTheGear">with all the gear it had equipped</a>, and if it reaches 10, that monster can use the special ability Purify.
</li><li> Many games in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em> series have hidden relationship values between different pilots, whether as friends, rivals, or love interests. This is quite useful in the games it appears in, as it can affect the skills of the pilots if they're surrounded by the people they like.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a> K</em> has a simple version that determines which of the two sidekicks gets to pilot the mecha that combines with Mist's, affects the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalGeneration">OG</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> slightly, and determines who's with you in the "fin" slide. If you do it right, you can get both girls in the ending, but you still have to pick who pilots the Selcerius.
</li><li> <em>Super Robot Wars Judgement</em> has a similar instance of setting the main character up with one of the copilots, although the implementation differs. There is an instance closer to K's in <em>Super Robot Wars Alpha</em> where you can determine whether Hikaru ends up with Misa or Minmay.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TacticsOgre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TacticsOgre">Tactics Ogre</a></em> has Loyalty points which are invisible but you can read them through Characters' opinion about the main character. Having Loyalty at zero will make the character feel "Disaffection" and leave the party; some special characters like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aloser</span> will immediately feel "Disaffection" and leave if you make a certain choice. There are many factors for raising and dropping loyalty: leveling them up on non-training battles will increase loyalty, but if you kill enemies with the same race as them they will drop their loyalty. Alignment has an effect too - if you have made "Lawful" choices the Lawful alignment characters' loyalty will increase while "Chaotic" characters' will drop, and vice versa.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuminousArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuminousArc">Luminous Arc</a></em> have Heart levels, which increased by choosing the right dialogue choice in the Intermission sequence with the character after every battle they participated in.
<ul><li> The sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuminousArc2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuminousArc2">Luminous Arc 2</a></em>, use a similiar system, except with fixed chapter choices.

She frees the dog, who in turn becomes attached to her. By praising the dog for doing something well, or giving him the jerky you find scattered around the castle, Hewie's bond with Fiona increases. Being mean to the dog will make him ignore you, and the ending will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">change</a>, depending on if he did or did not survive at the game's end.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5">Resident Evil 5</a></em> has a secret trust meter.

Having a too-low relationship with either one of them locks you out of the game's best endings, especially with the latter as angering her too much by being overly violent to things around you or failing to get out of the doll room in time when playing as Garry causes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her to kill Garry later on</span> (although getting Mary this angry is ironically <em>required</em> to get her ending). The best ending is obtainable only if Garry's bond with Ib is at max or near-max too, which requires you to not only be nice to him and talk to him at every opportunity but also to talk to him a <em>lot</em> of times at said opportunities.
<ul><li> Most actions you can take that anger Mary are Garry's fault, not Ib's, so you can anger Mary a <em>lot</em> and yet have her feel affectionately towards Ib. As of 1.04, if you almost max out Mary's anger meter and see a couple of disturbing scenes on the side, you are doomed to one of two endings that are even worse than any bad endings the game had previously. However, while in those endings <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ib and Garry are completely screwed no matter what you do,</span> you can still <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> save Mary</span> if Ib has gone out of her way to be nice to Mary.

</li><li> In the RPG based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em> characters have relationships with other important characters rated as die type, from d4 to d12, that you can add to rolls that deal with that character. The level does not represent how good the relationship is, but rather how strongly you feel about the other character. A d12 relationship could represent love, hate, or something else entirely.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ApocalypseWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ApocalypseWorld">Apocalypse World</a></em>, every PC has a 'History' stat for every other PC, which indicates not their feelings towards that character, but rather how well they understand them. This stat is rolled against whenever a player wants to help (or hinder) another's roll. It's initially set by choosing options during character creation which determine certain feelings or past events, and after that is altered by how you act - if you heal someone you understand them better, if you hurt someone they understand you better.

This doesn't really affect gameplay, except that if you piss one group off enough, you either have to please them again or bribe them to make them forget what you've done (additionally, pissing off the Allied Nations typically involves causing Allied or civilian casualties, which can get expensive after a while).
</li><li> Each of the Squadmates in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/BinaryDomain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/BinaryDomain">Binary Domain</a></em> has a personal loyalty meter that's affected by both your performance in battle (they react positively to killing robots really well and negatively to friendly fire) as well as your responses to them.

Not every character's reputation can be maxed out in either direction, but most major ones can. Depending on what you want from that character, antagonizing a character into negative values may be just as useful as playing along with them to get a positive value.
<ul><li> First, they give you story options. For instance, if you can make Albatross hate your guts, you can beckon him into sending his forces to kill you, leading to a helpful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar">Enemy Civil War</a>. Secondly, good and bad reputations give you stat bonuses on missions. For example: If you're unsubtle and threatening while Albatross is your handler, you get a health bonus. But if you're stealthy and manipulative instead, you'll get a stealth bonus.
</li><li> In addition, one particular character (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Marburg</span>), after doing a lot to deserve death, can <em>only</em> be goaded into a battle if he really hates you. If you've been playing the game telling everyone what they want to hear, then you will never have the chance to kill him.

Interactions could change alignments, stats and the way the final battle unfolded.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicIITheSithLords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicIITheSithLords">Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords</a></em> has an influence system that governs interaction with your party members. The higher your influence with a party member, the more their alignment will shift towards the player character's alignment. The system rewards both very high influence scores (adoration) and very low influence scores (contempt). With the appropriate influence, your party members will reveal their secrets or inner turmoil and depending on the character, can be trained into Jedi or Sith.
<ul><li> Obsidian Entertainment later carried the influence system over to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a></em>.
</li><li> They even show you the numbers representing your influence with each character in Mask of the Betrayer. Though the scale seems to have altered; in the original campaign influence changes in steps of one to four, while in Mask of the Betrayer the lowest change is six and the highest is 25. And you get bonuses for achieving certain influence levels.
</li><li> Obsidian used a similar faction system for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>.

This affects some interactions with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a>. It's also a key stat for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePaladin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePaladin">paladins</a>, whose powers are either improved or penalized by certain Dispositions, depending on the chivalric order chosen at character creation: for example, a Shieldbearer of St. Elcga will benefit from Diplomatic and Honest, and take penalties for Aggressive and Cruel.

Getting either of them high enough can unlock special <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack">Combination Attacks</a> as well as unique interactions.

The relationship value also determines whether the relationship is of a friendly or romantic nature. These use the same number and are determined in the same way, but are differentiated by their description on the status page. Although the player can engage in multiple romantic relationships at once, they will eventually be forced to choose a single romantic companion. Shunting the relationship value of the other involved characters from romantic to friendship usually comes with a pretty hefty reduction in the value. Thank the Maker you can just bribe them back into being your BFF with a few shiny gifts.

Occasionally, instead of simply approving or disapproving, they "slightly" or "greatly" approve/disapprove. Unlike most games with this mechanic, you cannot always prevent approval gains or losses by not taking specific companions with you; the consequence of the player being the leader of a massive organization means that the approval gains for large-scale, world changing decisions affect your entire party, even companions located elsewhere. They even retroactively gain or lose approval for big decisions you made before they were recruited.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em> has a simplified relationship system, in which the disposition of an NPC is only designated as variants of "enemy", "neutral" and "friend". These designations are invisible during gameplay and influence how the NPC will act towards the player and what kinds of dialogue they'll have. For example, an NPC designated as friend can offer cheaper prices if he's a merchant or offer to travel with the player if flagged a follower. The only way the player can influence this is by doing quests for an NPC, improving the relationship or by committing crime against them, lowering it.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, two values were originally used for hunter pets: Loyalty, which grows over time (if the pet is happy), and happiness, which is raised by feeding the pet food it likes. While Loyalty was pretty much meaningless after a while (unless you let the pet starve long enough), happiness affected the pets base damage. Both were eventually removed, though.
<ul><li> There's also the sorta-example of <em>reputations</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em> has Shepard develop friendships with his/her squadmates by completing side-quests for one half of the team, and romancing one of the squadmates in the other half. Urdnot Wrex, especially, because once Shepard recovers his family armor, persuading him to rejoin the heroes on Virmire becomes several times easier, since they've earned the krogan's trust.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> Shepard earn loyalty from each of his/her squadmates by completing their loyalty missions. It's a more oversimplified relationship system, as Shepard can just complete their respective loyalty missions, and boom, instant friendship! However, earning their loyalty also increases their odds of surviving the suicide mission; after all, when you're friends with someone, like Shepard's teammates to Shepard him/herself, your will to get the job done increases, as you're motivated to do it for those friends.
</li><li> Shepard also have to mediate two arguments, one between Jack and Miranda regarding the former's life as a Cerberus experiment, and the other between Tali and Legion regarding the latter uploading data from the former's people. Shepard can either side with one of those teammates and risk losing the others' loyalty, or if they have a high enough Paragon/Renegade meter, persuade both sides to stand down and work together as a team.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>:
<ul><li> There is an unspoken one between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Commander Shepard</a> and either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser">Ashley Williams</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficerAndAGentleman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficerAndAGentleman">Kaidan Alenko</a>, whomever is still alive. During the first third of the game, they're hospitalized, and depending on various actions Shepard undertakes, or already undertook over the course of three games (building a relationship with them, becoming romantically involved with them, not cheating on them with someone else (or being honest about it if you do), dropping by to visit them in the hospital, getting them a gift, or having a heart to heart <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> about them thinking you betrayed them by joining Cerberus in ME2</span>) their trust for Shepard is increased. At the climax of the mission where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cerberus attacks the Citadel, they are locked in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MexicanStandoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MexicanStandoff">Mexican Standoff</a> with you.</span> A high relationship will have them trust you unconditionally, while lower ones require reputation checks to avoid <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shooting and killing them.</span>
</li><li> There is also another hidden one that affects all party members. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It determines which squadmates will emerge from the <em>Normandy</em> after it crashlands, if there are any survivors. Love interests are given highest priority.</span> It also influences <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who will place Commander Shepard's plaque on the <em>Normandy</em> memorial wall.</span>
</li><li> The <em>Citadel</em> DLC has some more low-key examples, tracking who you take with you the most. The story begins with Shepard being ambushed alone - one squadmate comes to the rescue and another assures them over radio that the team is coming (love interests get priority). It later lampshades the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryHeadcountLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryHeadcountLimit">Arbitrary Headcount Limit</a> — when Shepard is forced to take two and leave everyone else, one will complain that they wanted to come, and your least-used squaddie will complain that they <em>never</em> get picked.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Each companion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> either likes or dislikes certain actions, which adjusts their hidden affinity value. At certain milestones of positive approval, the companion will speak to you, usually revealing more of their past. Once you reach 1,000 approval, the companion idolizes you, tells you how positive your influence has been on them, and you receive the companion's unique perk. Some companions have personal quests that you have to complete before their approval will plateau, and one can't advance beyond a certain limit until you complete enough quests for his faction. On the other hand, doing actions which the companion dislikes will cause them to scold you and, at low levels, they will threaten to leave, only reconsidering if you pass a difficult speech check (but only once: if you continue to do things they disapprove of, they'll leave and never return).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FaeryLegendsOfAvalon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FaeryLegendsOfAvalon">Faery: Legends of Avalon</a></em>, saying certain things to some characters  mostly joinable ones  will cause you to gain or lose approval with them. Usually, you gain approval by picking nice conversation options, although one of them likes it when you snark at her. If characters like you enough, they'll present you with gifts of equipment.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Earthlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Earthlock">Earthlock</a>:</em> Party members generate "Battle Bond" by fighting in pairs. Levelling up the bond unlocks passive benefits, which are different for each pairing of the six characters.
