It's the comedic flipside of the serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead">Due to the Dead</a>.
</p><p>The protagonist will see something in the casket that belongs to them, and must retrieve it without being noticed by the mourners or violating the corpse. This many times will result in the person's watch, bracelet, or cuff link getting snagged on something in the casket (going as far as on the <em>zipper</em> of the deceased).
</p><p>Or, he is asked to deliver the eulogy, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSpeakIllOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSpeakIllOfTheDead">struggles because he either barely knew the deceased or hated them intensely</a>.

The deceased was a comic and would abhor the idea of people wasting a day and a gathering moping about their passing. The funeral is full of good spirits as everyone shares their fondest memories of the passed and honours their memory with a smile.

<ul><li> In the filler "Laughing Shino" arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, the title character accompanies Shino to act as the representative for a man whose father has just died. If he / his representative laughs at the funeral, he loses his inheritance, and he knows his relatives will do everything in their power to make ū happen. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">Shino</a> is the obvious choice for a stand-in, but he's poisoned by a drug that causes him to laugh uncontrollably en route. Naruto has to take his place, and has a much harder time trying to ignore the antics of everyone else at the funeral. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However, it's later revealed that the father was still alive and the entire situation was an elaborate ruse; when his children were children, they were a pretty poor family, but were happy and laughed. However, when they discovered the valuable medical properties of the herbs around, they got greedy and forgot what was important, leading him to do this. Shino ends up pointing out the flukes in his plan before helping him pull it off.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em>, episode 231 has Gintoki and company attending a funeral for the owner of a restaurant they were regulars at, which the foreword states will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">a solemn, dignified affair.</a> It goes well up until Kagura gets involved, then takes a nosedive from there after she completely messes up at paying her respects properly, which provokes the owner's ghost into trying to ensure the processions go smoothly by force. It ends up having the opposite effect due to how horrified Gintoki and Hijikata are of him (Made worse by the fact that only they can see him), which leads to them making even more mistakes, wrecking his coffin and launching his corpse into a delivery truck among other things.
<ul><li> Part of a later story arc has everyone attending a funeral for a not-quite dead <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kagura</span>, which after a series of mishaps, leads to them all thinking that the proper way to pay their respects is to crush the coffin with a giant boulder...

Yusuke attends his own funeral as a ghost. To his disgust, he finds that some of his classmates are laughing and smiling, causing him to think that they only came just to get extra credit. Then he sees Keiko crying over his death, and Kuwabara mourning over his death and commenting that he was supposed to be there for him. Then he notices Iwamoto and Akash, who seem to be rather glad that he was already dead. But Mr. Takanaka confronts the two, and proceeds inside their house. He follows him, and seems to be a little bit surprised to see the teacher mourn over his death. He also sees his mother, also doing the same. The kid whom he saved is also there with his mother, and as they leave the kid tells his mother that he was really a nice guy even though some people there were angry at him. Seeing how much he's missed by his childhood friend Keiko, his mother, his rival Kuwabara, and his homeroom teacher gives him the resolve necessary to go through some difficult ordeals to get himself resurrected.

Deadpool plays various gags on the mourners as a ghost, such as getting a blind woman — Blind Al, for those familiar — to fall into his grave. He eventually crosses to the afterlife, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Death" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Death">Death</a> is waiting to seduce him, but is returned to life before anything occurs.

Boss Man interrupted Big Show's father's (outdoor) funeral by driving up in a former police car with a loudspeaker mounted on the top and cracking cruel jokes about Show and his father over the speaker. Then, he chained Show's dad's coffin to his back bumper and dragged it off while Show desperately held onto the coffin (in what's often called "the coffin surfing incident" by fans). This was part of a longer feud, that also involved a "sympathy" poem by Boss Man that included the lines, "But if I had a son who was as stupid as you/I'd wish for cancer, so I could die too."
<ul><li> Said poem was followed by the beautiful sentiment "That's exactly how I feel about the Big Show's daddy being dead".

The player can either intervene, cutting the zombie down whereupon his nephew curses the fact he's going to have to rebury the mangled corpse, or just leave them be, whereupon Lester will kill Nevin and then shamble off in search of his mistress for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILoveTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILoveTheDead">"one last quickie"</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note64n9e');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note64n9e" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note64n9e');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Most players will side with Nevin, simply out of pragmatism if nothing else — killing Lester gives the party 7500 experience points and a random gemstone on his corpse, whilst letting him kill Nevin gives them nothing but the single gold piece they can loot from Nevin's body.</span>

<ul><li> An early strip shows Davan attending the funeral of his childhood friend, Scotty, who committed suicide. His grief quickly takes the form of rage towards Scotty, which he then takes out on the corpse. Literally, taking the corpse out of the coffin to shake it and yell at it. In the background, J. Grant, making a cameo, urges Davan to "let the legions of the dead know we living will no longer be oppressed by their cold clutches."
</li><li> Another one features Davan laying out his plans for his own funeral, where he will be dressed in a smoking jacket and propped up in a chair so that people can have their photos taken with him. There will be attractive cocktail waitresses (to make sure Jason attends) and marshmallow roasting on his pyre, after which Aubrey will be given his skull to mount on her wall.
</li><li> Yet another includes Faye <a class="urllink" href="http://www.somethingpositive.net/sp07132003.shtml">referencing this trope<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in regards to Davan's paternal great-grandfather.
</li><li> Another strip had Peejee sending a wreath to the funeral of a female supervisor who'd spent the last few weeks sexually harassing her (and was threatening to sue her when she was killed by a Canadian Trapdoor Alligator). Unfortunately, the floral service screws up the order... and a giant "You'll Always Be My Valentine!" wreath shows up instead.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>: Several:

Eventually, Frank is killed after touching live electrical wires, and at the funeral, Homer falls asleep and mutters "Marge, change the channel!" The other funeral-goers and even Rev. Lovejoy to burst out laughing, and inspires Lenny to remark "That's our Homer!" The tombstone simply has "Grimey" written on it, Homer's nickname for Grimes which he himself despised; Lovejoy also referred to Grimes as "Grimey," as though he accepted the name with affection.
<ul><li> In a later episode, Homer is getting dressed for his wedding anniversary when he pulls out the program for Grimes' funeral ... and realizes he has completely forgotten who this guy is.
</li></ul></li><li> Maude's funeral in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS11E14AloneAgainNaturaDiddily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS11E14AloneAgainNaturaDiddily">Alone Again, Natura-Diddily</a>" had a 21 T-shirt Salute, rather tasteless given that Maude was killed by a t-shirt shot at her with one of their bazookas. Also, a later episode reveals that, off-screen, Homer fell in Maude's grave. "I saw a gopher! What a day!"
</li><li> After Krusty the Clown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead">fakes his death</a> in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS7E15BartTheFink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS7E15BartTheFink">Bart the Fink</a>", the town turns out for his funeral, at which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BobNewhart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BobNewhart">Bob Newhart</a> is conscripted to provide the eulogy.
</li><li> And there's always Homer's mom, who asked that her ashes be thrown away at a certain point at a certain time. Of course, this was really part of her plan to stop Mr Burns from polluting the Amazon.
</li><li> The season four episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS4E13SelmasChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS4E13SelmasChoice">Selma's Choice</a>" (the one where Marge's Great-Aunt Gladys dies and Selma continues trying to have a baby before she hits menopause [which actually happened in a later episode]) actually had a funeral home sign that reads, "The Lucky Stiff Funeral Home — We Put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">the 'Fun' in Funeral</a>". Bart also scares Lisa into thinking the corpse is still talking.

As the parade of mourners pass by, Nelson spots the cupcake that Lisa had just left on her brother's forehead, cheerfully remarks, "Hey, they've got food at this thing!" before grabbing it for himself, and then declares "Here's one for the road, dude!" before starting to thuggishly punch Bart's corpse.
</li><li> During <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTraceyUllmanShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTraceyUllmanShow">The Tracey Ullman Show</a></em> "shorts" era, there was "The Funeral," where Bart is (well) himself at his elderly Uncle Hubert's funeral. (Presumably this is Abe's brother or cousin.) First, Bart clenches his hands in sadistic anticipation of viewing Hubert's corpse at the visitation, only to collapse when he actually sees Hubert's body. Later, he helps "direct" the pallbearers to the gravesite, in preparation for the casket being lowered into the ground; a disgusted Homer grabs Bart before he can pull any other hijinks.

On a much sadder note, Lisa was the only mourner present (not counting her parents).

While his friends are all successes (Lenny is President of the United States, Barney has multiple Oscars and Flanders is a Cardinal), his own body is placed in the back of a dump truck then thrown into the ground haphazardly.

That one episode of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a>) expresses disgust at this, Princess Carolyn, who never actually knew Herb, goes on to make up all sorts of over the top stories about her doing charity work with him well into the night.
</li><li> The great reveal: Herb's gold was actually the manuscript for his novel, which he hopes will become his legacy after he dies. It's terrible, and what looked like an odd mix of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>murder and plagiarism</em></span> was actually a perfectly well intentioned attempt to stop the manuscript from being published and humiliating Herb.
<div class="indent"> <strong>BoJack</strong>:<em>(reading out loud) "The carpenter's boy was a hungry boy, hungry for crumpets, but also hungry, dot dot dot, for life" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">Beat</a>) ... He literally wrote out "dot dot dot".</em>
</div></li><li> And the fun does not stop there!
<ul><li> After Princess Carolyn convinces everyone she was very close to Herb, she gets to keep his urn with his ashes (which has the same plaid pattern he had on his shirt). The urn shows up again several times throughout the series... And most of those times, it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AshesToCrashes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AshesToCrashes">falls and breaks</a>.
</li><li> Eventually, BoJack has an orphanage named after him... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but he sends them an email with a typo and the orphanage is named... "Jerb Kazzaz Orpahange"</span>. Todd points out that Herb would have found it hilarious that BoJack could not even get that right.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017">DuckTales (2017)</a></em> episode "The 87 Cent Solution!", Scrooge's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(fake)</span> funeral is an appropriately somber affair...until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Glomgold</a> crashes the event wearing a white sequined suit with dollar-sign-shaped shades, blasting DJ Khaled's "All I Do Is Win", throwing money around like he's at a strip club, and twerking at the corpse. He then attempts to climb on to Scrooge's casket to dance on it, but is stopped by his thoroughly-embarrased assistant.
