<ul><li> Eita Touga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TwelveBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TwelveBeast">12 Beast</a></em>. However polite and professional he is, the universe will <em>always</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronButtMonkey">put him in an awkward situation,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PervertRevengeMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PervertRevengeMode">within range of violent retribution.</a>
</li><li> Akatsuki Oosawa from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AestheticaOfARogueHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AestheticaOfARogueHero">Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero</a></em> is one HELL of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HormoneAddledTeenager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HormoneAddledTeenager">Hormone-Addled Teenager</a> and uses his powers to this purpose, much to the embarrassment and anger of the girls in the cast... but he <em>cannot</em> resist to see a girl in tears, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl">will go to great lengths</a> to fix it.
</li><li> Hachibe Maeda of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiKora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiKora">Ai Kora</a></em> is a strange case. While admittedly an individual who values women for the aesthetic appeal of their various body parts, he is willing to go to extreme lengths to protect the owners of those parts.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoeAnthropomorphism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoeAnthropomorphism">Greece</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>, especially when compared to resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac">Lovable Sex Maniac</a> France. He's known as #1 in the frequency of sex among nations and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedPeopleAreFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedPeopleAreFunny">has even less problems with nudity</a> than France does, but his overall personality is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">very</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KindheartedCatLover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KindheartedCatLover">different</a> from France's. This becomes most obvious when he's shown with Japan: he's made one or two sexual advances towards him (which may or may not include actual sex), but most signs of his genuine affection for him are less centered on sex and actually pretty sweet (seriously, trying to speak Japanese? Taking all of Japan's snacks after the other nations ignore them? Being worried about his hair looking unkempt to Japan?).
<ul><li> Not to mention, the nations generally panic at the prospect of France being around because they fear he'll jump on them (And let's be honest, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves">he probably WILL</a>). Greece, despite being known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">*very* sexually active</a>, does <em>not</em> incite that same reaction.
</li><li> A subtler version is Prussia, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">might talk big about</a> how fearless and awesome he is, but freaks out at the sight of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentFanserviceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentFanserviceGirl">a teen Hungary's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage">half-naked body</a> and, once he realizes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsettlingGenderReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsettlingGenderReveal">she's a female</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleasePutSomeClothesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleasePutSomeClothesOn">he quickly hands her his cape for cover.</a>
</li><li> There's also Seborga, who is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatinLover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatinLover">Latin Lover</a> but doesn't hit on female nation-tans who are too young for him, like Wy. (He does promise to do it when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsAllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsAllGrownUp">She Is All Grown Up</a>.)
</li><li> France sees himself is this. "Love should never be forced on anyone," indeed. However in practice he himself pushes boundaries without fully crossing them. He will not outright rape anyone, true, but he has flipped skirts, undressed people of both genders against their wills, etc. Not to mention <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">openly admitting he's a pervert</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtLeastIAdmitIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtLeastIAdmitIt">and takes some degree of pride on it</a>, which is something an average example would most likely think twice before doing.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Shunsui Kyoraku from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> loves flirting with his lieutenant, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotLibrarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotLibrarian">Hot Librarian</a> Nanao, and was known for chasing girls when he was in the shinigami academy. He promptly rescues Nanao when she collapses after Yamamoto sends out his <em>enormous</em> reiatsu and it overwhelms her. He's also a very badass captain who first tries to convince his rivals to give up on their purposes <em>and</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialPacifist">only accepts to fight so he won't disgrace his opponents</a>.
</li><li> The character Ral from the manga <em>Blue Dragon</em> (note: has nothing to do with the game) is this. Finding out the difference between men and women is a big part of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>. (The fact that women have boobs and that he loves said boobies helps a lot.)
</li><li> Kurozuma Wataru from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun">A Certain Scientific Railgun</a></em> is a super rare type of guy who can make a sincere comment about a girl's figure (and he does so to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ACupAngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ACupAngst">two people who are likely to fly off the handle at that</a>) and give no offence. As Misaka and Kuroko said, he commented on their breasts in a strangely unperverted manner <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0marf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0marf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0marf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(He was reminiscing about when Konori-senpai's breasts were like that)</span>.
</li><li> Hideki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Chobits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Chobits">Chobits</a></em>. Make no mistake, he is a underwear-ogling porn addict, but would never take advantage of Chi in that way. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">And heaven help you if you do</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter">City Hunter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ryo Saeba is sometimes this and sometimes just an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech">Handsome Lech</a>. The "chivalrous" part is mainly when he's getting serious.
</li><li> Mick Angel also sways between this and Handsome Lech.
</li></ul></li><li> The deceased Prince Clovis la Britannia from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, who despite being a tyrannical bastard, isn't a misogynist in the least. You'd never guess it if not for the 6th <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PictureDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PictureDrama">Picture Drama</a>, though: it has his half-sisters, Cornelia and Euphemia, checking on some stuff he left and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct">Cornelia</a> frets over the sweet and naive Euphemia being willing to wear one <em>very</em> revealing swimsuit that Clovis designed in his free time. Milly also has shades of this.
</li><li> Cross Marian <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em>. His character info in the fanbook, lists one of his likes is "good women." He has no problem hitting on pretty girls, even younger ones like Lenalee. But when he found out about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the death of one of his lovers, a young woman named Anita</span>, he was genuinely saddened and despite him not wanting <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Anita</span> to follow him, he says she was a good woman. It's also stated, by Allen, that under his bed at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligiousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligiousBruiser">his church,</a> is filled with keepsakes from his lovers-pictures and accessories. Seems to show a sentimental side to Cross.
<ul><li> With the aforementioned Lenalee, he holds her close, and protects her on the crumbling ark, while simultaneously trying to halt download of the Akuma Egg, but he never lets go of her, until after danger has passed. He also only stayed at the Order, which he hates, because Lenalee asked him to. It ended being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba">Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</a></em>, Zenitsu's colorful rant about women and their curves gave him a bad first impression with the Butterfly Estate girls, but Zenitsu is actually seriously commited to the idea of marrying someone fully intent on loving them, even when it made him suffer, as in the past there were women who entertained him, with bad intentions, like the unknown woman whom Zenitsu had eloped with and piled him with debts, where he had to be rescued by his future swordsman master, prior the beginning of the series.

</li><li> While Asaba may have entertained the notion that Arima and Yukino's future daughter would be his soul mate, he gave up on that idea pretty quickly when she was born and became another father figure to her. When she turned fifteen and confessed her love for him, Asaba was really disturbed.

</li><li> Warrant Officer Oreldo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PumpkinScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PumpkinScissors">Pumpkin Scissors</a></em> embraces the trope completely. He loves the ladies, and unlike many similar characters, he enjoys quite a bit of success with them. He's also always willing to get the crap beaten out of him for the sake of some cute girl he's just met, and frequently sets himself up as the bad guy in order to make sure things are made right for the girl of the moment — such as when, angered by how a poor girl's drug-addicted father was wasting her money and opportunities, he made a show of offering to buy her from him and then pretended to assault her in order to finally goad her father into taking action on her behalf.

</li><li> Kurumu Kurono is a rare female example.

</li><li> Tsukune himself has his moments of this: for example, his initial reason for wanting to join the Swimming Club (before finding out water is a vampire's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor">Kryptonite Factor</a>) was so he could see Moka in a bikini.

Haruki Hanai, who's most forward with her, is the most chivalrous of all the men, though he actually subverts the idea by being perfectly honest with what he says and thinks.

They're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">like sisters</a> to him.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TonaGura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TonaGura">Tona-Gura!</a></em>, Yuuji will not touch or dream of touching underaged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyRichKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyRichKid">Lonely Rich Kid</a> Nina, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagBoobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagBoobs">Gag Boobs</a> aside. Despite Marie's early explanation of her role in 'punishing' brother Yuuji and it being for her safety as well, there are places he will never go. Unless the target is Kazuki.
</li><li> Vash the Stampede from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em> is an obvious example, though the sincerity of his perversion is up for debate as many of his apparent emotions act as covers for his overwhelming inner pain. This aspect of his personality is also mostly absent in the manga as he never really demonstrates significant attraction to any characters.
<ul><li> The movie <em>Trigun: Badlands Rumble</em> continues this trope with Vash and cranks the comedy element <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> when it comes to Amelia. Anyone who's seen the anime series in full knows that being the way he is towards women is about the best he can do to enjoy a woman's company without letting them find out just who he truly is. He acts like a pervert, but he would never <em>actually</em> take advantage of a woman.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TrinitySeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TrinitySeven">Trinity Seven</a></em> main character Arata Kasuga is <em>incredibly</em> up front about how much he likes women with large breasts (but still likes women with no breasts, too), will openly comment on the attractiveness of his classmates, thanks women "for the meal" whenever he sees them nude or in revealing clothing, and generally makes it clear that he would enjoy having all kinds of perverted fun with anyone he finds attractive. Despite all that he is <em>very</em> respectful of their feelings: he doesn't try to sneak peeks at women when they expect privacy and doesn't force himself on women physically <em>or</em> verbally. Probably the most clear-cut example is when he turns down <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lilith Azami in the OVA</span> when she offers herself to him for sex <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">so that he might learn about her thema, Lust</span>. Arata surprises her by turning her down flat, reasoning that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">since everyone's thema is the opposite of their core personality,</span> having sex so casually is the <em>last</em> thing she would ever want to do; as much as he wants to do perverted things with her, he only wants to do them <em>if she will enjoy them, too</em>.
</li><li> Ataru Moroboshi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura">Urusei Yatsura</a></em> normally shows more the pervert than the Chivalrous, there are incidents like when he's been inflicted by a contagious toothache that he can ease the pain of by biting (and infecting) other people, initially the entire class tries barricading themselves away from him, but then the girls realize that he would never do anything like that to a girl and apologize to him for mistrusting him. And in a later story, when he finds himself stuck with a pair of gloves that make him hug then punch anyone who comes close to him, when Lum gets close, he blocks the gloves punch by pushing his own face in it's way. Then does this again and again till he knocks himself out.
</li><li> Toshiki from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VideoGirlAi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VideoGirlAi">Video Girl Len</a> is an unrepentant, irresponsible, flirty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">The Casanova</a> who dates and dumps girls and constantly tries to peek on Len Momono to see her naked. He's also a loyal friend who hugs Hiromu and cries with him when he's heartbroken, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> takes beatings from delinquents to save Hiromu and Ayumi, and when Len offers to have sex with him to see if her mission would be easier, he does <em>'not</em> take her offer</span>. Yeah, the guy may be a major pervert, but when his friends truly need him he's very much there for them, so it's no wonder that with all of his high libido he <em>still</em> was pure-hearted enough to see the Neo Gokuraku store.

He basks in their attention and it is made straight-out obvious that he is a huge womanizer in his first appearance (he even has a hit song solely about breasts. In the original Japanese version, that is). However, he would never lay a hand on a woman who showed no interest in him, and is very concerned about their will-being (for example, he took Suzume to the hospital after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteClumsyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteClumsyGirl">she hit her head against a pole and fell on her bottom</a>, and in that same episode he performed for and handed out gifts to a group of sick children). He always puts his friends (and especially his mamodo partner, Kanchome) first and would never abandon them, even if he is a bit of a coward.

And then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadykillerInLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadykillerInLove">he meets Lilac</a> and he's pretty much the reverse of the above, trying to act aloof and disaffected despite caring about her a great deal (much to his chagrin).

Not just because he's attractive and very generous with regards to payments, but also because he does stuff like compose and perform praise songs about his favourite prostitutes (despite most definitely not being smitten with them - "sparing his feelings while sating his body" is the main reason he prefers prostitutes over relationships) and probably because he's described as "eager to please" in bed.

When he's not in a dedicated relationship he has a knack for bedding nearly every adult woman he meets and it's shown passionate one-night stands is how he befriended several of the immortal women he knows. Yet he also acts like perfect gentleman and adheres to an old-school code of chivalry through-and-through. One notable incident early on his him flying into a rage when he finds out a mortal friends son is being stalked by an immortal because he raped the man's adopted daughter and consider just throwing him to the wolves despite his dislike of vigilantism. He also has the personal honor to draw the line when a newly immortal 18 year old girl he's known since she was a child starts coming onto him.

<ul><li> Tyrion Lannister's reputation across Westeros for his drinking and whoring is such that the brothel in Winterfell awaits his arrival with great enthusiasm. However he almost always treats women with great respect (his sister excluded, though that is quite another matter), and loathes to see them harmed or abused in any way. Given his disgust for people who treat weaker people badly and his personal history this makes perfect sense. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When he and Sansa Stark are forced into a political marriage by his father, Tyrion can plainly see her reluctance to go through with consummating the relationship. Even though he's extremely drunk, he still stops her from undressing and tells her that he won't bed her until she actually wants him to. And if she never wants to? His reaction says it all.</span>

He hits on them on numerous occasions and tries several ploys to either see them naked or see them kiss each other, but when everyone believes Phoebe's been in a porno movie, Joey is the only member of the gang who refuses to watch it. He also freaks out quite a bit when Rachel calls his bluff and actually offers to sleep with him.
<ul><li> Joey is so good to his female friends, that upon hearing Phoebe was pregnant, he goes out to beat up the supposed father... then comes back and proposes to Phoebe so she won't be alone. Later when he finds Rachel is the one who is actually pregnant, he promptly proposes to her too.

It also meant he rarely had to actually pursue a woman, unless the plot called for it.
</li><li> Jay from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheInbetweeners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheInbetweeners">The Inbetweeners</a></em> is perpetually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe">lying, in revoltingly graphic detail, about all the girls he has apparently had sex with even though he's obviously a virgin</a>, and generally talks as though he thinks of women solely as sex objects.

A good example is the episode "Miss Pretty", where he is secretly the magazine's new advice columnist. When Maya asks for an interview, Dennis gets a friend of his (a scuzzbag who specializes in bogus lawsuits) to pose as the columnist. But when Maya starts dating him, Dennis becomes concerned, and eventually confesses to being Miss Pretty rather than have her go out with someone more depraved than he is.
</li><li> Francis Bryan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTudors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTudors">The Tudors</a></em> showed signs of this during his first episode.

</li><li> Buck Wilmington from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMagnificentSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMagnificentSeven">The Magnificent Seven</a></em> TV series. Hits on/sleeps with every woman he meets but treats them all with respect. He attributes this to the fact he was raised in a brothel but his mother taught him to treat every woman like a lady.

</li><li> Tony DiNozzo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em>. He started out as a regular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">The Casanova</a>, hitting on every skirt he could find, and even after six seasons of character development is still interested, but he would never even think of hurting a woman. And his father is one as well.
</li><li> Hank Moody of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Californication" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Californication">Californication</a></em> could qualify. While he sleeps with almost every woman he meets (including ones who hate him), he is usually the first to assault (read: knock out) anyone who either inappropriately insults a woman or mistreats them somehow.

Kirk from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em>. In fact, for one episode, Spock and McCoy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpottingTheThread" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpottingTheThread">were clued in</a> that something wasn't right with their captain (Kirk's jilted ex-lover was inhabiting his body), despite having no physical proof, because the fake captain had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHitAGirl">struck a woman</a> (who the real Kirk was inhabiting).

With the exception of the mentally unhinged woman mentioned above, all those we meet in the present seem to still have a great deal of love for him.

For the most part he sleeps around, but has defined morals; he appreciates the company of women for their own sake and he is contrasted with actual perverts in the form of 50s-style chauvinists, whom he opposes and he doesn't get along with the 50s masculine persona. In one oddly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacter">Out of Character</a> episode where they believe the war is about to end he's shown having three girlfriends, each of whom apparently believes she's in a serious, exclusive relationship with him. When they want to make plans for after the war, like a chickenshit he tells them he's been married all along.
</li><li> Sam Axe from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice">Burn Notice</a></em>. He's certainly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">The Casanova</a> and (for the first two seasons, at least) had a collection of sugar mamas, so we know he's appreciative of the ladies.

He flirts with most of the women he meets, but when we see him with Cassie, we find out that he really loved her, but she didn't believe him when he told her what he did for a living, breaking his heart as she left. And he isn't exactly thrilled when he discovers that his pal Castiel plans to hand a girl named Anna (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel">Fallen Angel</a> whom Dean had slept with) over to the angels.

However, he has serious problems with other men being crude and creepy around women (whatever he might be, he is never crude or creepy), particularly in the office; as he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">says to Peggy</a>, "I have rules" about this sort of thing. When he breaks these rules and drunkenly seduces his secretary Allison in Season 4, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">it's used as an indication of how far he has fallen</a>.
</li><li> Damien Scott of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrikeBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrikeBack">Strike Back</a></em> is a regular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">The Casanova</a> but is usually honest with the women he sleeps with or at least as honest as being a secret government operative allows him to. When he is held captive together with a female hostage he quickly seduces her. However, once they are rescued he declines to have sex with her because he realizes that it would be taking advantage of her vulnerable emotional state.
</li><li> Mel Frohike of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> (and later spinoff <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLoneGunmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLoneGunmen">The Lone Gunmen</a></em>) is a short, squat, balding man with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PornStash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PornStash">Porn Stash</a> that rivals Mulder's. His reaction to Scully was to openly oogle her and make comment on how attractive she was. However, he showed up at Scully's hospital room with flowers, he kept vigil on her while Mulder was hunting down her attackers, and he saved her from a hoard of randy men who were shamelessly taking an advantage of her drugged-and-turned-to-a-bimbo state. When it comes to the Gunmen's own cases, he's fiercely protective of women unless he thinks they're pulling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">Wounded Gazelle Gambit</a>.

When he suspects the worst in getting a mandatory vacation, she puts a positive spin on it, and tells him to take advantage of his situation. He takes that cue to set up a romantic evening with her, but when she storms in furious over their coworkers jumping to conclusions about their staying together, he promptly drops the idea - then indignantly calls them out on it the next day.

Understandable, considering he's played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceCampbell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceCampbell">Bruce Campbell</a>. He's constantly hitting on his partner Emilia Rothschild, despite her insistence that she's not interested, as well as every other attractive woman who comes across his path (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat">Catherine the Great</a>). In fact, his assignment to Pulau-Pulau is partly due to him sleeping with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>'s niece, whom he'd been sent to rescue. However, he will never force himself on any woman nor will he stand idly by while a woman is being abused, usually donning his Daring Dragoon outfit. Additionally, while he's clearly attracted to Emilia, he will not ruin their relationship and partnership by taking advantage of her while she's under influence. A memorable scene involves him tricking an attractive undergarments seller to model for him, claiming that he's picking out an intimate gift for his wife for their anniversary. He does end up buying one of them at the end of the episode... as a wrapper for the real, much more romantic, gift.
</li><li> Neal Caffrey from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhiteCollar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhiteCollar">White Collar</a></em> flirts with every woman he meets, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">usually successfully</a>, but he always cares about the women he sleeps with on a surprisingly deep level, as well as having a lot of respect for the women he has no romantic or sexual involvement with or interest in. Kate, Alex, Sara, Elizabeth, June, Ellen, Rebecca, Diana - he'd go to the ends of the earth to ensure their safety. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">too bad it didn't work for two of them, and one of them was manipulating him the entire time.</span>

But he will not stare at a couple of lesbians making out, because he's a gentleman. And he's also <em>amazingly</em> up-to-date on feminism, considering he's been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedGoodInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedGoodInACan">trapped down a well</a> for the last 130 years (and before that, he was the kind of guy who'd make jokes about betting "wives and horses" on poker games...).

<ul><li> Desh in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII">Final Fantasy III</a></em>. Gave us the famous quote: "Hey, we have a ship! Now we can pick up girls from all over the world!".

</li><li> Edge in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em>. A prince who will fight like a wildcat to protect his people, but never misses an opportunity to get close to pretty ladies.
</li><li> Edgar from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>. A king who tells little girls he'll marry them when they grow up... and spends his days working as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Gadgeteer Genius</a> to protect every last one of his subjects. He hits on Terra when Locke first brings her to Castle Figaro, but is also willing to put himself (not to mention his own kingdom) in great risk in order to protect her from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Kefka:</strong> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">girl of no importance</a> recently escaped us, and we heard that she found refuge here... <br/><strong>Edgar:</strong> That's a tough one... You see, there're more girls here than grains of sand out there. I can't keep track of them all!
</div></li><li> Cloud in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> is not automatically an example, but the game is set up to encourage the player to act like this, with other characters reacting appropriately. You can have him flirt with Jessie, flirt with Aeris, flirt with Tifa, flirt with Yuffie, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayBravado" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayBravado">flirt with Barret</a>, flirt with a girl in a bee costume, check out girls on the beach, rub suntan lotion into the back of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanserviceExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanserviceExtra">Fanservice Extra</a>, strike a pose and then <em>run</em> into a brothel shouting "Let's go!", peek through keyholes into other rooms at the brothel, and make a party out of himself and two of the girls (Barret: "Thought you'd do that.") You are also given the opportunity to mistreat the girls, but usually it's either jokes at their expense or misjudged negging. Whatever way you play him, he's extremely protective of the girls - even Yuffie, with whom he has a more argumentative relationship, he makes a point of comforting at times.
</li><li> Irvine in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em>. It's mostly an act, at times even bordering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveIMentionedIAmHeterosexualToday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveIMentionedIAmHeterosexualToday">Have I Mentioned I Am Heterosexual Today?</a> -practically the first thing that he does upon meeting the team is to suggest a party composition of himself and two of the girls, but as the plot unfolds it becomes clear that he's actually still hopelessly infatuated with his childhood crush and his biggest concern is looking out for his friends.
</li><li> Zidane in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em> is practically the poster boy for the series alongside Edgar. He actually has "Protect Girls" as a support skill which lets him intercept attacks on women, and is constantly flirting with females throughout the game. He also subverts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantActPervertedTowardALoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantActPervertedTowardALoveInterest">Can't Act Perverted Toward a Love Interest</a>, as he shamelessly makes passes at Garnet the entire game, though he backs off slightly when he realizes he's actually in love with her. There's also an instance when he touches Garnet's butt by accident, and his immediate response is remarking how soft it is.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy">Dissidia Final Fantasy</a></em> reveals that not even gods and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a> are off-limits to him, as his battle quote to the Cloud of Darkness is "You are impressive, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">in more ways than one</a>", and when Cosmos appears before him he instantly replies "Today's not a good day for a date".
</li></ul></li><li> If we're putting all the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> examples together, add political mastermind Al-Cid Margrace (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">NOT Cid</a>) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em> and, more obviously, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2">Final Fantasy Tactics A2</a></em>.
<ul><li> Similar to Zidane, Al-Cid in A2 has most of his combat abilities become stronger the more female units there are in your party on the battlefield. He also has one or two abilities which only work on females! To drive the point even further, when you fight him and his party of ladies before he joins your party, the law forbids you from harming females!
</li><li> Balthier gets this characterization in the <em>Final Fantasy XII</em> manga, romancing Ashe before he even knows her name. The original game gave him shades of this, but it was rather subtle about it compared to the manga's interpretation.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DotHackGU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DotHackGU">.hack//G.U.</a></em> games: "I, Kuhn, cannot allow this atrocity to go any further!"
<ul><li> He says this when a girl is wandering a dungeon alone - he wants to protect her. And then, he finds out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">her true age...</a>
</li><li> Although he's a nice guy in general, and has a strong (albeit sometimes hidden) sense of justice, he is <em>particularly</em> nice to women. This backfires on him when he hits on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossPlayer">Cross Player</a> in the sequel OVA.
<ul><li> Saburou is generally fairly obvious as to "her" real gender, which just made it even more of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Epic Fail</a> for Kuhn.
</li></ul></li><li> Surprisingly, one of the characters he doesn't appear to be attracted to is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">Atoli</a>. Of course, he's more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">Shipper on Deck</a> with her and Haseo, which might be why...
</li><li> Ironically, Kuhn is Tomonari Kasumi, Mai Minase's boyfriend from <em>Liminality</em>. The audience gets the pleasure of seeing "the only serious girlfriend he ever had."
</li></ul></li><li> It's practically a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> tradition to have at least one of these in each game.
<ul><li> Perhaps the best example: Sain the Paladin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemElibe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemElibe">Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword</a></em> (the seventh one overall, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarthDebutedInSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarthDebutedInSmashBros">the first one to be released in the United States</a>), who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a>. He knows how knights in that particular genre of game pick up women, so he inserts a lot of stereotypically "knightly" phrases into his speech. Which would probably work, if anyone else in the game talked like that. He does a lot of stuff — like trying a "heroic" pose with a lance in the middle of a fight, but in the process forgetting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors">Tactical RockPaperScissors</a> and taking an axe to the face for his trouble — that show how he's trying to be honorable and heroic but is really just perverted and hilarious. Sadly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShooOutTheClowns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShooOutTheClowns">he shows up less and less</a> as the game gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a>, and notably has no plot-mandated lines after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss">Disc-One Final Boss</a>. Darn shame. So many good opportunities missed.
<ul><li> Despite this, he never had any support talks with his lord, stating a more professional relationship between him and Lyn. Also, he is one of the few guys who can distract a girl from her troubles in their supports (Priscilla's conflicted feelings for Raven, Fiora's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorGuilt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorGuilt">Survivor Guilt</a> after losing her squad, Serra demanding vassalage as a part of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">Stepford Smiler</a> facade, Isadora's angst over her relationship with Harken).
</li><li> It's worth emphasizing: Aside from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Kent</a>, Sain <em>only</em> has women in his support list!
</li><li> Sain has no support talk with Lyn because she's already taken: His best friend Kent has a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush">Bodyguard Crush</a> on her. So, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy">he steps aside</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatchmakerCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatchmakerCrush">for his friend</a>, and openly tells him so in their supports. (Heck, Sain's dying quote is: "Lady Lyndis, I was... so happy...!") And then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a> kicks in: Sain fears that if he ever <em>was</em> alone with Lyn, he'd give in and declare his love for her, which in his mind could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">a potential betrayal</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BashBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BashBrothers">against his closest buddy.</a> He's a perv, but he's not stupid!
</li></ul></li><li> See also Saul, who alternates between preaching and flirting with every women he sees. He even straight out tells Ellen, another priest, that he's loose and may do "undesirable things" to her, but she thinks he's better than that. (His other female supports, like Cecilia, tend to see through his religious charade easily though.) But when he gets serious, well, <em>he does get serious</em>: if you promote him and make him face the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister">Sinister Minister</a> Oro, Saul is clearly PO'd to see a fellow clergy member playing the villain role, and tells him "You disgrace the Gods, and you <strong>will</strong> pay for that!".
</li><li> To a lesser extent, Forde from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones">Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</a></em> fitted this bill, but nowhere near the epic awesomeness that is Sain. He does flirt with Vanessa a bit and teases Kyle about his love life, but he's not <em>too</em> forward and is still dedicated to serving Ephraim.
</li><li> Or Bastian, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance">Path of Radiance</a></em>. Add Shakespearian dialogue to the mix as well.
<ul><li> And Gatrie, who is re-recruited later in the game while protecting Astrid and he won't be recruited back into the Greil Mercenaries unless she talks to him first. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdSniper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdSniper">Shinon</a> snarks Gatrie would hit on a tree if it had a skirt on.
</li><li> Heather from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn">Radiant Dawn</a></em>. She flirts with several girls (Nephenee, Mia, Ilyana) and once stripped a guy who fancied her from all his gold, but her main motivation is her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">Ill Girl</a> mother whom she supports and loves very much.
</li></ul></li><li> Also Alec from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemJugdral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemJugdral">the fourth</a>. Though if he gets married, he sort of quits flirting for the sake of the wife. Doesn't stop him about complimenting women in general, though (as described with his last dialogue with Briggid, if paired).

He's a shameless flirt who spouts reams of flowery compliments upon the ladies, often throwing in a proposal even if he's only just met them, and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radar/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radar/FireEmblemAwakening">it's been repeatedly and strongly implied</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">he sleeps around quite a bit</a> (whether with maids or noblewomen). He actually has incredibly high standards for how a lady ought to be treated and will react with appropriate vengeance if he feels someone else has violated those terms. Not to mention, when he learns about a girl's boundaries, he will <strong>not</strong> step over them; i.e., when he learns that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Olivia</a> is too shy to learn a duet dance from him, he <em>goes to the other side of the room and teaches her from there</em>.
<ul><li> Unsurprisingly, he becomes quite offended and/or hurt (depending on who he's talking to) if anyone suggests his intentions are anything but honorable. (Which separates him from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech">likable and cheery but-more-loose, bed-hopping</a> Inigo, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessBride">no not that Inigo</a>.

</li><li> To a milder degree, there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAhnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAhnold">Gregor</a>. Quite a few of his supports with females involve him teasing them about having crushes on him, but he tries to serve as a matchmaker for Cordelia <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatchmakerCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatchmakerCrush">despite his possible feelings for her</a> and <em>never</em> forces the girls into anything they don't want to do. In his support with the Avatar, Gregor suggests ways for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">him</a>/her to keep up his/her health... such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntimateHealing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntimateHealing">sharing body heat with him in bed.</a>

In fact, Celica recruits him from an infamous pirate's dungeon, since he got captured trying to save a girl named Est. Heck, when he changes class in a Shrine to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotGod">Mila</a>, his promotion line sounds a LOT like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustRomanceCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustRomanceCthulhu">he's flirting with a goddess</a></em>!
<ul><li> Jesse also rescues Silque (with <em>far</em> more success) before the start of the game, as seen in a Memory Prism flashback. Afterwards, she notes he's much friendlier than she assumed at first. It suggests that his rescues are out of genuine concern, despite all his flirting.
</li></ul></li><li> Lorenz from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a></em> also seems to fit the bill. In his case he keeps trying to "charm" women because he's sizing them up as a potential suitable wife (which he sees as his responsibility as a noble in order to forge ties for his House) and seems <em>shocked</em> when Byleth has to explicitly tell him it's making them uncomfortable, but he never treats any girl he supports with like anything less then a lady, even if they are commoners like Dorothea, Leonie or Mercedes.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledButCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledButCute">Sylvain</a> flits between this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech">Handsome Lech</a>. On the one hand he's known as a skirt-chaser and has a reputation for dating girls for a short while before breaking up with them <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> as he secretly believes they are only dating him for his Crest and thus holds them in contempt</span> and Byleth even walks in on him being accused of cheating in their C-support. (Also unlike Inigo, Sylvain is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">definitely not unsuccessful</a> at scoring girls.) However, despite this, Sylvain confirms that while he is a heartbreaker, he really doesn't enjoy it and hates seeing a girl cry. His interactions with Bernadetta and Marianne also prove he does care about their feelings - he never flirts with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileFlower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileFlower">Bernadetta</a> because he knows she's too emotionally fragile for it and genuinely compliments her writing skills instead, and in his Supports with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Marianne</a> when he sees his behaviour is making her uncomfortable, he immediately backs off and instead gently encourages her to smile because he believes it will help her be more confident when interacting with others.

He's a master of iaido and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">a very stylish man</a>, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShades">Cool Shades</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat">Badass Longcoat</a> (as well as an enormous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">Nice Hat</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NorioWakamoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NorioWakamoto">and an epic voice</a>). And he flirts with <em>every</em> female character that crosses his path. Those pirates, by the way? All girls. <em>Young</em> girls (and all of them are orphans, like Johnny himself, who gave them a home as he took them into his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCrew">Badass Crew</a>), with the exception of the cook. And then <em>XX</em> has him flirting with Bridget, who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderReveal">revealed</a> to be male. But alongside these little details, he's extremely badass as a fighter <em>and</em> much smarter than he looks, being able to keep up with people as powerful and competent as Ky and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Testament</span>, and while he's definitely not a law-abider, he's usually on the good side of the axis. <em>And</em> he cares for the safety of all the girls in his crew: should someone harm one of them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionDad">Johnny</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf">will NOT be happy.</a>
</li><li> Jansen Friedh from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostOdyssey">Lost Odyssey</a></em> fits this trope to perfection. He joins your party with a woman on each arm and stone drunk and shortly afterwards falls hard for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic">Stripperiffic</a> amnesia-ridden immortal queen, acting overprotective at every turn. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>.
<ul><li> Ironic in that, by comparison, Jansen is the one that needs protecting, as said queen is arguably the best magic user in the game.
<ul><li> Jansen is a powerful mage in his own right: the real irony comes from the fact that, even <em>before</em> she gets her memory back, Ming is arguably more chivalrous and self-sacrificing than him.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends">Mega Man Legends</a></em> incarnation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Blue Bomber</a> is a champion of justice who has a nasty habit of peeping at his adoptive sister in the bath.

<ul><li> This also extends to his voice actor, Tsuyoshi Koyama, who straddles the line between this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac">Lovable Sex Maniac</a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWQ-MDBIBM0">as evidenced by his borderline sexual harassment of a staff girl at a convent.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AsamiImai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AsamiImai">Asami Imai</a> got fed up with his antics and threatened that he'd have to pay a ¥5000 fine each time he touched the girl, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreatBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreatBackfire">he considered it a fair trade</a>.

Unlike Bang, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet">he's quite the stud</a>. He usually flirts with many a playable character, carries another woman into the match and tossing her up before showtime (only for her to land on him one way or another after the fight), and makes overt passes at Makoto (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PervertRevengeMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PervertRevengeMode">which gets him no small measure of pain</a>).

</li><li> Zevran Arainai plays around with this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>. While he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller">Professional Killer</a> who wears <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">The Casanova</a> facade, when genuinely pursuing a relationship with someone, he switches into this mode. He makes a point of only having sex on an amateur basis, though. Sleeping with the target only makes things complicated.
<ul><li> And his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a>, Isabela the Pirate Queen. While a <em>pirate</em> with some extremely dubious morals and an endless source of innuendo, she believes sex should always be fun for everybody involved. Men, women, men dressed as women, vice versa - even all at once, if the participants are willing! She and Zevran have actually met (as well as <em>met</em>) and they get along very well.
</li><li> In <em>both</em> cases, the option is there for a threesome (or more) with Zevran and/or Isabela, but it's your call (or the call of your other love interest) if it's acceptable. If not, they won't press the point. . . or if <em>you</em> do, flat-out say it's not going to happen since one person has a problem with it.
</li></ul></li><li> Haken Browning from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EndlessFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EndlessFrontier">Endless Frontier</a></em>.

Notably, the only time he brings up sex outright, he's politely offering it as payment for the use of a mermaid's ship.

He still uses his charm to imply that he would be delighted to work closer with his female co-conspirators, but treats them with respect and can keep his mind on the job when necessary.
</li><li> Advocat of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrimGrimoire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrimGrimoire">GrimGrimoire</a></em> flirts with students and makes blatant innuendos towards almost everyone, however he takes his role as teacher and protector very seriously and is highly honourable, especially compared to other demons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona">Persona</a></em>:
<ul><li> Junpei Iori in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> makes some pretty lecherous comments towards the girls on the team, but when push comes to shove, he's always got their back, as best seen in his <em>Persona 3 Portable</em> Social Link. After all, it's because of his kindness that Chidori Yoshino falls in love with him.
</li><li> Yosuke Hanamura from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em> is also pretty perverted, given how he fanboys over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Rise Kujikawa</a> and at one point encourages the girls to wear swimsuits that <em>he himself picked out</em>. Somehow, his eventual roommate Teddie is an even bigger perv who's constantly trying to "score" with women. Nonetheless, both of them are good friends and dependable teammates who are wholly invested in the team's goal of foiling the killer, and Yosuke in particular is absolutely disgusted when he finds out just how misogynistic the killer is.
</li><li> Ryuji Sakamoto from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em> is not above peeking on his closest female friend when he has the chance to, but he's a still kindhearted boy who always respects a woman's physical boundaries and hates people who don't, which is one of the many reasons why he absolutely hates Kamoshida.
</li><li> In general, the player characters from <em>3</em> onward can be this depending on your chosen actions and dialogue. In particular, <em>5</em>'s protagonist seems to be this no matter what; the whole reason he's on probation to begin with is because he tried to save a woman from being molested, but he's not above peeping on Ann Takamaki during cutscenes.

Namely, Roy has attempted to give advice to his fellow soldiers that proves to be completely inappropriate for the soldiers' current situation despite the similar wording (For example, if a soldier attempts to call Campbell asking for advice in regards to distance between themselves and the enemy that is far enough away to not trigger an alert, and he ended up giving advice about personal space in regards to dating a girl.), as well as teased Snake about getting a girl like Elisa into joining his side as he thinks that she's about five years too young to be sexually mature. However, he has shown himself to have quite a bit of a restraint in regards to dating girls: For instance, he passed an opportunity to date a girl he had an attraction to for his brother's sake (they were both attracted to the same girl) and joined the Green Berets. This carries over to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</a></em>, where he's in a relationship with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance">much-younger</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty">Rose</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This is all a ruse to keep the Patriots from finding out that Rose's child is Raiden's, thus trying to prevent them from using Rose and the baby as leverage against him.</span>

Even in <em>Later</em>, when he does want his relationship with the heroine to get physically intimate, he mostly asks if she's ready to go further and only once ends up pushing her boundaries beyond what she's comfortable with.

Despite his lust for — and later, near sexual relationship with — Meg, he has shown on many occasions that he cares for Meg, comforting her and giving her advice in her time of need.

There's one episode in which the gang is playing "I Never," and Quagmire drinks to <em>literally everything</em> that's said. After the first few (comparatively believable) lines, the scene fades to show dozens of empties in front of Quagmire while the others are still on their first beer and trying (unsuccessfully) to think of something sexual that Glenn won't have to drink to.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Playboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Playboy">Hugh Hefner</a>, if <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/hughhefner/status/90567328336580608">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> tweet in response to someone asking how he "has so many bitches" is any indication.
<div class="indent"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"I have a lot of girlfriends because I don't call them bitches, Jroe. A little respect will take you a long way."</a>
</div><ul><li> One of Hugh Hefner's former Playboy Bunnies, Kendra Wilson, described him as very respectful towards the women, he had never treated them badly and never forced them to have sex with him, he asked them politely and was discreet by saying "do you want to go upstairs?" He treated the women as if he was in a genuine relationship with them and not forced by wealth, profit or luxury. She also said that he paid for her wedding (he spent over a million dollars for her) when she was engaged and that she described him as a best friend rather than a boss.
</li></ul></li><li> Modernist architect William Pereira. His playboy lifestyle in 1940s/50s Los Angeles was well known, and reportedly had very high "standards" when it came to women he hired, but the man never went outside either of his two marriages when it came to relationships.
</li><li> We've mentioned Jack Harkness before, but his actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnBarrowman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnBarrowman">John Barrowman</a> counts as well. He's developed a reputation for being... overly affectionate, both with co-stars (he's apparently flashed every costar he's worked with, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElisabethSladen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElisabethSladen">Elisabeth Sladen</a> being the sole exception) and with audiences (it's a running joke that a convention hasn't really begun until Barrowman has kissed someone.) However, he's been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> for six years to a partner he's been with for over twenty.
</li><li> Bob Guccione may have been the publisher of the audaciously racy <em>Penthouse Magazine</em>, but he also developed a reputation of creating one of the best magazine businesses for women to work in in the 1970s, rivaled only by Gloria Steinem's <em>Ms. Magazine</em>, with no issues with sexual harassment and with many women in senior editorship and management positions.
</li><li> The famed Roman general Scipio Africanus had a weakness for beautiful women. While he was campaigning in Iberia during the Second Punic War, some of his troops offered him a young woman of exceptional beauty as a war prize. But he returned her to her family, her virginity intact, without even claiming a ransom. This worked out very well for Scipio, since her fiancé turned out to be a Celtiberian prince named Allucius, who chose to ally with the Romans after this moment of clemency.
