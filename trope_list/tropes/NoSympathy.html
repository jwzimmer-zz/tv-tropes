</div></div><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Common sense dictates that it never pays to judge someone too quickly, jump to conclusions, or condemn someone without hearing the whole story. In the world of fiction, however, many characters are not only guilty of all of the above, but feel no remorse for it whatsoever, even when it results in serious emotional damage.
</p><p>For example, here's a quick quiz: It's your birthday, and you have told your boyfriend/girlfriend/other loved one exactly what you would like as a present to mark the occasion. You walk into the living room and find your gift... which has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenTreasure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenTreasure">broken/ripped into a million little pieces</a>, although someone has clearly been making a valiant effort to repair it. Moreover, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">it's the wrong color.</a> As you're staring at it, your Loved One stumbles in from the kitchen. They have their arm in a sling, their jeans have been ripped by something that clearly has sharp teeth, and they don't seem to have noticed that their hair is on fire. Seeing you, they offer a lopsided smile, and a tired if hopeful "Happy birthday."
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Do you:
</p><ul><li> a) Ask "what the heck happened to you?" as you reach for the fire extinguisher or fire blanket?
</li><li> b) Tearfully hug them in an attempt to soothe their distress (trying to avoid being set alight yourself)?
</li><li> c) Throw a hissy fit at their failure to secure the correct colour of gift, rant and rave at their clumsiness in breaking it, then toss them out of the house before they set off the sprinklers?
</li></ul><p>Most of us of (relatively) sound mind would choose (a)  the softer hearted (or fireproof) among us might choose (b). For some reason, though, an awful lot of characters in fiction prefer (c), throwing a tantrum or launching into a lecture when there really weren't any grounds for one.
</p><p>It's as if they've suffered a complete case of empathy failure. Anyone can tell that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> has had a hard time. They've got the scars to prove it. At the very least, any onlooker's sense of curiosity should wake up for long enough to ask "Why is there a piranha attached to your thigh?" Moreover, basic human decency would dictate that we cut them some slack when they're clearly in pain, at least for long enough to figure out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSideOfTheStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSideOfTheStory">the whole story.</a>
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>More bewildering is when the friend/onlooker knows <em>exactly</em> what the hero's been through, because <em>they were there too.</em> They <em>know</em> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina">Diabolus ex Machina</a> has been rather busy in the hero's social circle, and that his buddy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusAngstMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusAngstMachina">Deus Angst Machina</a> covered a couple of Diabolus' shifts for him when he had the cold. Yet still they show absolutely no mercy, demanding that the hero "pull himself together" or "get over it!" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithFriendsLikeThese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithFriendsLikeThese">So much for friendship.</a>
</p><p>A variant of this trope is a character type who is blind to the suffering of others. Not in the active, thoughtlessly cruel way of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy">Comedic Sociopathy</a>, but just completely unable to appreciate the pain or distress of other people. If anyone "fails" them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">there will be hell to pay</a>, no matter how much effort went into fulfilling their orders. Generally, this is a personality trait of more cynical characters, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">The Stoic</a>. Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> types sport it as well, although in this case they'll probably be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">called on it</a>. In both cases, the writer usually makes it clear that the "problem" is on the side of the character with no sympathy, not on the side of whoever is unfortunate enough to cross them.
</p><p>This is an odd trope; although often seen in comedies, it's not always comedic as far as the audience is concerned, and can be a real sucker punch if the protagonist undergoes tremendous hardship only to have his friends <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EtTuBrute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EtTuBrute">berate him</a>.
</p><p>A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KafkaKomedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KafkaKomedy">Kafka Komedy</a> often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invokes</a> this trope. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy">Comedic Sociopathy</a> is its demented sibling. Sometimes No Sympathy can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> if the characters are young, since younger people are expected to be more self-centered and less empathic than adults... although, having said that, this may be extremely unfair to young people. It might also be justified if the recipient is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victim</a> since, let's face it, it's kind of hard to sympathize with them to begin with.
</p><p>Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">Ungrateful Bastard</a>. If a character is deliberately stated to be <em>incapable</em> of sympathizing with the feelings or viewpoints of others, that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy">Lack of Empathy</a>. For when nobody seems to find women enacting random violence towards men for non-existent reasons at all unusual see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnprovokedPervertPayback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnprovokedPervertPayback">Unprovoked Pervert Payback</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RashomonStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RashomonStyle">"Rashomon"-Style</a> shows frequently have contrasting examples of this: someone who got hurt will usually report callousness and lack of sympathy from the other characters, while each one describes him or herself as the one who acted most effectively and compassionately to the injury. For a fitting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockPhrase">Stock Phrase</a> regarding this trope, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuitYourWhining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuitYourWhining">Quit Your Whining</a>. For the audience version, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstDissonance">Angst Dissonance</a>. If this sort of attitude is aimed at characters who hold a grievance, then it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSympathyForGrudgeholders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSympathyForGrudgeholders">No Sympathy for Grudgeholders</a>. For characters rejecting sympathy instead of being given the lack of it, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontYouDarePityMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontYouDarePityMe">Don't You Dare Pity Me!</a>.
</p><p>A character who displays this trope can be and often is turned into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">The Scrappy</a>, as audiences hate them for being nasty and spiteful pricks to people who've usually suffered enough to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">The Woobie</a> - assuming they aren't intended to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink">Hate Sink</a> to begin with.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven">Eureka Seven</a></em>, 14-year-old Renton's undying loyalty to the crew of the Gecko State is rewarded with a humiliating fake mission staged for their amusement. Told that it was of 'paramount importance', Renton <em>doesn't even realize he's being mocked.</em> As the 'mission' starts to fall apart, so does he. In tears, berating himself for his uselessness, the crew watches via secret camera as he delivers a lengthy speech about his admiration for them all, his happiness at being given this critical mission, and above all, <em>his trust in them</em>. They stare, wide eyed, at the screen... and burst into laughter at how idiotic he is. Then they make the mission objectives more ridiculous, photograph him at the most humiliating point of his life, and publicize it on the cover of a globally read magazine. The entire mission is recorded. And shown to his girlfriend. It's actually meant to be amusing. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny">It's not.</a>
<ul><li> And, for the record, Holland himself watches the video. The last words of the episode are him muttering to himself "I am so uncool."
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NyanKoi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NyanKoi">Nyan Koi!</a></em>, the hero suffers from a bad cat allergy. His mother and sister know quite well that he's allergic to cats. They respond by sending their cat in to wake him up in the morning, having the cat sit and eat at the table with him, and complaining that everyone else in the family loves cats, as if his condition that could produce a deadly reaction was a matter of personal taste. No matter how much he clearly suffers, they continue to treat him as if he's just whining.
</li><li> Tends to happen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em>, usually to anyone who isn't named Lina - she's generally the instigator. The most extreme cases range from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy">Comedic Sociopathy</a> (using the chimeric Zelgadis as a boat anchor to catch a dragon in a lake, where he nearly drowns, gets hurt, and nearly eaten) to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KafkaKomedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KafkaKomedy">Kafka Komedy</a> (using Princess Amelia as a bride for fish bait in order to survive on an island in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudioAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudioAdaptation">radio drama</a>; before that she nearly died in the ocean, and in another drama Lina shows no concern for Amelia when she shoves her in a barrel to hide and forgets that she is drowning in a sewer) to genuinely sad moments (neither Lina or Zelgadis show care when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphansOrdeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphansOrdeal">Sylphiel's father is killed</a> or when Amelia's father is thought to have been assassinated).
</li><li> Hoo, man, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Shitsurakuen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Shitsurakuen">Shitsurakuen</a></em>. The manga is based around <em>insanely</em> abusive boys with equally insane superiority complexes. It's actually a bit difficult to read, simply because a good amount are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Karma Houdinis</a>.
<ul><li> Hey they're learning the meaning of feelings... well at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">some of them</a>... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIdone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIdone">sort</a> of.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">Played for Drama</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha"> Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>. Fate Testarossa, only 9 years old, is told to collect magical artifacts of untold power by her mother, Precia. She throws herself at the task with reckless abandon, exhausting and injuring herself to dangerous levels. Her mother responds by whipping her until she collapses, furious at how slowly Fate's progress has been. It gets worse. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When it's found out that Fate is just a clone, Precia says something to the effect of "That's right. You're nothing but a fake. I never loved you <em>once</em>. I <em>despise you</em>." Fate STILL forgives her, and says that even if she's hated, she'll still protect her mother. Her mother smiles, and replies "How stupid."</span>
</li><li> Anime boyfriends seem prone to this, accusing their girlfriends of being "stupid" or "reckless" when it's clear that said girlfriend was trying to help them out. Bikky does this to Carol in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FAKE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FAKE">FAKE</a></em>, Rei does it to Kira in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MARS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MARS">MARS</a></em>, and the whole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub">Host Club</a> do it to Haruhi when she tries to rescue someone from bullies. Often, this ties in with the advice to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">Stay in the Kitchen</a>, and can result in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>.
<ul><li> It's somewhat justified in the Host Club's case. They weren't scolding Haruhi because she tried to rescue someone, they were scolding her because she tried to rescue someone <em>by herself</em>, with no regard for her own safety and no-one to help her if she got in trouble, even though they were all just down the beach and could easily have been called in as backup.

For further clarification, during battles she worries very much about Kenshin, even at the risk of her own life. It's only after the battles are over and the dust has begun to settle that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">she fulfills this trope</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SoraWoKakeruShoujo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SoraWoKakeruShoujo">Sora Wo Kakeru Shoujo</a></em>, Nami's depressed state of mind is not helped by her family's complete lack of love and sympathy. Her sisters practically kick her around as some scurvy dog and don't even once wonder why she acts the way she does.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turned by her brainwashed older sister Takane, no less, who actually does care about her—somewhat, anyway. Takane recovers, beats the crap out of Nami and leaves her to die. None of Nami's relatives seem particularly concerned about what happens to her afterward</span>.

</li></ul></li><li> Wolfram in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KyoKaraMaoh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KyoKaraMaoh">Kyo Kara Maoh!</a></em> is always on Yuri's case, accusing Yuri of cheating on him in situations where Yuri was just being polite/trying to avoid death. However, a case could be made that Yuri (among others) is equally insensitive to Wolfram's feelings; Wolfram is often accused of being a brat in scenarios where he was genuinely trying to do something positive.
</li><li> Ash occasionally gets this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>, especially when Misty was traveling with him. Examples:
<ul><li> "Ignorance Is Blissey", in which he is the victim of a very clumsy Blissey multiple times, to the point where he needs to be treated by Nurse Joy, and when he comments that he never did get supper, both Misty and Brock jump down his throat, though the fact that they didn't get to eat as well may have made them a little testy.
</li><li> Another example happens much early when Ash is right on the verge of capturing a Weedle when he is rudely interrupted by a Samurai, who demands that they have a Pokémon match. During said match, the Weedle manages to escape back into its tree and alert the Beedrill, who capture Ash's Metapod. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">The Samurai berates Ash for making excuses</a> and not finishing what he started, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">even though the Samurai was the one who got them into that mess</a>, because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">his inability to wait a few seconds for Ash to finish capturing the Weedle</a>.
</li><li> Another notorious example happens when Ash loses the Indigo Plateau League. Not because he was defeated, but because his final Pokémon, Charizard, was lazy and refused to follow commands. Not only that but the only reason he had Charizard on him and was forced to use it was because Team Rocket kidnapped him, made him wear down his team escaping and exhaust his Pidgeotto flying back. When he does arrive the referee demands the match begin immediately, not even asking why he's late, let alone why he's arriving in such a weird manner and gives him no chance to swap out his two useless Pokémon for Kingler, Muk or Tauros. When Ash sinks into depression afterwards everyone berated Ash for feeling sorry for himself when he had every right to be disappointed since he worked so hard to get in the League, only to have it snatched away via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina">Diabolus ex Machina</a> and the ineptitude of the referee (ie, declaring a Pokémon unable to battle after being afflicted by sleep, a decision that has <em>never</em> been made at any other time).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Another example</a></em> (This happened to Ash a lot, didn't it?) was in the very second episode when Ash carried an injured Pikachu to Viridian City's Pokémon Center. The Nurse Joy of the center angrily berates Ash for his supposed reckless care of Pikachu, completely unaware that Pikachu had been the one treating Ash poorly and refused to stay inside the Pokéball, or that they were attacked by a flock Spearow which Pikachu fended off.
</li><li> And what about the time they found Togepi's egg? No matter if Brock was the more experienced in raising Pokémon; what rights did he have to snatch the egg from Ash's hands the way he did and then run off with it? Worse, Misty <em>gleefully</em> supported it, and then she has the luck of Togepi seeing her first as soon as it hatches.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TailOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TailOfTheMoon">Tail of the Moon</a></em>, Usagi is feeling rather depressed, as she's just learned Hanzo used to be engaged to Sara. Not only that, Sara and Hanzou have just split up over Hanzou's flirtatiousness, and Usagi feels responsible as Hanzou was helping her when he argued with Sara. Hanzo sees that she isn't training, and even though he can see she's got something on her mind, he proceeds to throw her put of the village and lock her out, refusing to let her in even though Sara and several others protest. When he finally <em>does</em> go to let Usagi in, it's started raining and she's heading back to her village. She's still upset when he catches up with her, but he never apologizes even when she <em>does</em> return to his village.
</li><li> This happens disturbingly often in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl">Hell Girl</a></em>. At least early on in the show, the clients end up sending the target to hell out of sheer desperation since they believe otherwise the target will get away with murder. Why do they believe this? Because for some bizarre reason, the Japanese (as depicted in this show) are very quick to make pariahs out of people and assume <em>the absolute worst</em> about the client, turning on their supposed loved ones, friends, or acquaintances at the drop of a hat.
<ul><li> Episode 1's client got photographed in town with a man? Everyone's first assumption is that she's a slut who deserves to be screamed at without being given a chance to explain herself.
</li><li> Episode 3's target manages to create the mere <em>suspicion</em> that the client is the one who murdered his friends? Everyone in town, including the client's family, automatically assumes the client is guilty with no more evidence than that, and the client is forced to run away from town in order to avoid being arrested for a crime he didn't commit.
</li><li> Episode 6's client's mother got <em>raped</em> as part of a blackmail scheme by the target to shut the client's mother up about the adultery the latter witnessed? The client's father's first assumption is that his wife was cheating on him, and he starts screaming at her about it without giving her a chance to explain.
</li><li> Episode 11's client's father is framed for murder by an editor? The <em>client</em> is punished for his father's supposed mistakes by losing his home and his money and basically everything required to function in society, and his friends treat him as a loser the second he no longer has money. For a show that hammers home the futility of holding grudges and angry feelings in one's heart, the Japanese (as depicted in this show) sure seem quick to point fingers and hold others up as shameful pariahs at the slightest provocation.

Even before then, she jumped over Goku to get to Gohan and ignored Krillin when he pointed out that Goku was badly hurt. Her justification, it was <em>Goku's</em> fault that Gohan was in battle and hurt. This is ignoring that Goku was dead for almost a year and it was Piccolo who trained Gohan without his knowledge. When he did get to the battlefield, he told Gohan to stay back and then sent Krillin and him away, wanting to fight Vegeta alone. Gohan returned to fight on his own and Goku only told Gohan to fight since he couldn't move anymore. So, she's blaming Goku for stuff he had no control of. She was called out on this by several characters.

</li><li> Vegeta gets this from Krillin during the Cell Saga after he gets his ass kicked by Perfect Cell, and in this case, it's completely justified, since Vegeta deliberately <em>helped</em> Cell become perfect for the sake of a good fight, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">arrogantly assuming he could easily beat Cell no matter how strong he got</a>.

Even though Mary Jane does not know at this point that Peter is Spider-Man, you'd think most people would understand that a full-time college student who struggles to avoid falling back on rent for his studio apartment might not have as much free time as a retiree (Aunt May), a jobless loser (MJ's dad) or a wealthy heir (Harry) would to go and see her play, and yet she treats him very coldly and cruelly based on this fact alone and refuses to hear his legitimate reason for missing it (the usher refused to admit him, to say nothing of the fact that his motorscooter was <em>destroyed in an accident</em> that wasn't his fault, as he was dealing with two crooks being chased by police). Yeah, yeah, he promised her he'd see it, but you know what?

She wakes up to a very angry Goodwin who promptly tears her a new one for always going out the front door of her lodgings, while the healer tells her to lay off.

When Ren, Eldest Whistler, and Captain Tern along with a company of soldiers come across one who was kidnapped and raped, and then died after his tongue was cut out, Ren is horrified.

Problem is, since his wife was damned, Cato has forsaken his unconditional love for his wife in favor of unmovable apathy and Virgil's appeal has no effect on him.

</li><li> Bernard Mac Laverty's <em>Father and Son</em> has a pretty breathtaking example of this. A recently bereaved father struggles to care for his son after the mother of the family dies. Said son repays him by running away for two years until he gets ill and has to be rescued by the father, who nurses him back to health. Rather than being grateful for the rescue, and the subsequent sacrifices his father had to make for him, the stupid little twit cuts him no slack, whining constantly about his father's lack of masculinity (since it's now dad who does the housework), drawing violence and illegal activities into his dad's house, and throwing a fit whenever his dad asks him where he's going when he leaves the house. All right, the son was going through his own mucked-up grieving process, and the theme of the short story was the isolation of grief and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">Poor Communication Kills</a>, but you may be left feeling that the son <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">deserved everything he got</a>, especially when you consider that the father constantly tries to bridge the gap between them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIronTeeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIronTeeth">The Iron Teeth</a></em> web serial is full of bandits, mages and goblins who won't ever care for anyone other than themselves unless there is a good reason behind it. Blacknail, the goblin protagonist, has a twisted logic where he would never admit that others can be good for him even if he was just saved by them.
</li><li> This tends to crop up amongst various characters in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> series. One oft-cited example in <em>Eclipse</em> is when Jacob forcibly kisses Bella, upsetting her enough that she punches him and breaks her hand in the process. She comes home visibly angry and with her injured hand, only for Jacob and Charlie (who was previously characterized as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad">Overprotective Dad</a>) to basically exchange high-fives. Charlie does later show more sympathy, but it's still less than one would think a guy would have for his assaulted daughter.
<ul><li> Another example would be the treatment of Leah throughout the series. Her first transformation into a wolf accidentally causes the death of her father, her fiancé leaves her for her cousin; as a member of her former fiancé's pack, she has to constantly hear his thoughts about how happy he is with her, and her other cousin Jacob is constantly pining over a girl who he clearly has no chance with. Leah is understandably a bit bitter about all of this. The rest of the pack generally treat Leah as a horrible shrew for being upset about these things, up to and including treating her like an idiot for not being able to put Sam behind her, but coddling Jacob for acting even more pathetic over a girl who was never his girlfriend.

Throughout the series, Ellie has to bail out best friends Nadine and Magda when they pick up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> and run with it... and in gratitude, they're quick to abandon Ellie in favor of whichever boy they're pursuing at the time. However, when Ellie tells them she's thinking about going to her boyfriend's dance rather than to a concert with Nadine and Magda, they get <em>very</em> catty and accuse her of abandoning them, despite the fact that Ellie shows far more regard for their feelings when they do for hers. Occasionally, this can verge on (non-)<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy">Comedic Sociopathy</a>, as when they accuse Ellie of overreacting when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she finds a drunken Magda lip-locked with Russell, Ellie's boyfriend, at a party</span>.

Unfortunately, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssInAmbassador" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssInAmbassador">American consulate</a> turns them down in part because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">America has turned into</a> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Christian theocratic empire</a> and has cut ties with the European Union prior to this event.

George came home to find Annie scared and quiet and Mitchell furiously kicking Tully out (both of which were drastically out of character for the two, and should have tipped him off that something really upset them) and instead of asking what happened, declares that he won't let Tully be sent away. Mitchell eventually outright tells George why Tully is being sent off - because he sexually harassed and frightened Annie. George still sides with Tully, much to the shock of Annie and Mitchell. (George later comes around, thankfully, and apologizes.)

Rob is waylaid on the way to their wedding and goes through hell to get there. When he finally arrives late, all Laura can do is bawl him out over his supposed utter insensitivity. Rob takes a surprisingly large amount of abuse before announcing that he's decided not to marry a woman who — when her fiance' arrives disheveled, covered in mud, and hopping around on one foot from a sprained ankle — can't be bothered to even ask what happened before piling on. After piling on, she tries to leave, but he physically prevents her from doing so in order to explain himself. By the time he's finished, she is a bit more forgiving.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DocMartin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DocMartin">Doc Martin</a></em>, the title character has a tendency to miss appointments or other important meetings because the villagers of Port Wenn seem to time their medical emergencies to happen at the least convenient moment. This does not stop the people he no-showed from complaining about having their time wasted, even if he was performing lifesaving first aid (which is usually what happens).

Just as she's talked them round, a bed falls through the ceiling.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em> seems to go out of his way to invoke this in other people, just so he can protect his ego. For example, take the Tritter thing; being tripped was humiliating, sure, but the other characters might have had more sympathy for him if he had actually told them about that instead of keeping it to himself. (Of course, he also tends not to show sympathy for others; sometimes it's a deliberate act, and sometimes it's, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrJerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrJerk">the premise</a>.)
<ul><li> Subverted in "97 Seconds" when House asks for sympathy after electrocuting himself and being hospitalized... even though he electrocuted himself deliberately as part of a self-indulgent experiment involving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearDeathExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearDeathExperience">near death experiences</a>.
</li><li> This does happen a lot to him. He's addicted to Vicodin <em>because</em> he's in chronic pain, but it was established in the first season that House was an addict with a history of drug-seeking behavior already when he had his infarction. Cuddy and Wilson already knew him then. But nobody else seems to think of the pain when they criticize his addiction and tell him what a jerk he is, either.
</li><li> In season four finale, he had been in an accident and had a head injury, but still Wilson asked him to do a potentially fatal test on himself to save Amber's life, since Wilson was dating her. When House did it anyway, and Amber died anyway, Wilson stopped being friends with him for a while (although this is suggested to be just Wilson dealing with the grief).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleHouseOnThePrairie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleHouseOnThePrairie">Little House on the Prairie</a></em>: Several times, Nels Oleson to his wife, Harriet, after she has gotten her comeuppance and she tries to cry on her husband's shoulder, insisting that she had been treated unfairly and horribly. Nels will simply remind her that she got what she deserved. This happens in "Harriet's Happenings" (when Laura and Albert give her a taste of her own medicine by switching the printing plates to create inaccurate stories about her (Mrs. Oleson) and Nellie; he simply reminds her that she had a duty to report the truth) and "Crossed Connections" (when Mrs. Oleson is convinced to place the entirety of her savings into the stock market and invest in a failing company ... which goes bankrupt in short order; Nels makes her go back to work to earn her money back, this as penance for her having spread a rumor that nearly ruins the marriage of one of Nels' closest friends, Jonathan and Alice Garvey).
</li><li> The use of this trope is often detrimental to the characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em> (making them occasionally come off as unlikeable sociopaths) because of the way the show shifts between comedy and drama, the tone determining whether there will be sympathy or not and the audience disagreeing with the writers' sense of humor.
</li><li> The heroes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime">Once Upon a Time</a></em>, often display this to Rumplestiltskin, following his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> in the middle of the fourth season; regardless of how involved he actually is in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s plot...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych">Psych</a></em> sometimes if not often have the characters show shades of this, and the entire thing is usually played for laughts whatever misfortune it is. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">However, Psych is primarily a comical show</a> so laughing at bullet wounds/kidnapping/near death escapes is pretty common. In short, the characters seem to mysteriously know whether the danger is real or not.
<ul><li> Also very much subverted whenever the show decides to get serious (such as the Yin-Yang trilogy.) Whenever things get serious, there is a definite level of camrederie and support, especially when some of the protagonists reach their limits in dealing with the crises. Examples include <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lassiter comforting Juliet after her kidnapping in the Season 4 finale during her breakdown, Juliet trying to keep Shawn out of harm's way when he is on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> when an old family friend is revealed to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop">Dirty Cop</a> who shot his dad and even Lassiter gives Shawn some support because of that.</span>

She doesn't seem to care that she is surrounded by fellow outlaws who have <em>also</em> suffered at the hands of Gisborne: Little John had his wife and son tortured, Much lost the woman he loved, Allan had to watch his brother get executed, and Robin's <em>own wife</em> was <em>murdered</em>.

</li><li> There was another rather bizarre instance of this in season six, where J.D's friends were getting frustrated at his apparent whininess (although they didn't say this to his face). This felt a little odd given that what they viewed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">Wangst</a> was caused by the apparent death of his unborn child, his losing his girlfriend, his lack of an apartment and having to sleep on a deck, his developing an odd medical condition which caused fainting spells, and his getting a DUI (admittedly, the last two took place a bit later). Granted, a lot of his complaints took place offscreen, so it's hard to judge how annoying it would be in real life, and it's possible that a lot of time had passed within the show since what happened with Kim, but considering that Elliot never provoked any hostile reactions from her friends when she was going through similar problems in the earlier seasons, it still seems <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">a tad unfair</a>.

He is initially regarded as a prodigy. At the team's state qualifying tournament, he answers almost every question and single-handedly pulls his school into second place, thus qualifying for the state championship. He answers the last question of the tournament incorrectly, thus dropping his team into fourth place, which is still high enough to qualify for state. His teammates and coach immediately turn on him, declaring him an incompetent choke artist who will drag the school into the gutter. When a rival team hijacks their bus, Bobby is the only member of the team at the finals and performs flawlessly, but when the rest of the team shows up they shove Bobby aside and tell him to sit out before he ruins their chances. It isn't until Bobby asserts himself and keeps the rest of the team from making a tourney-losing mistake that they accept him again.
<ul><li> A major snag with Hank and Bobby's relationship is that Hank often has trouble sympathizing with Bobby over any of his problems. It's played a bit more realistically than in many other examples on this page; Hank isn't necessarily being cruel or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> (at least not intentionally), but he and Bobby are so fundamentally different that Hank just can't understand it when Bobby is upset. When Bobby hates being a towel-boy for the football team, he hates it because he's yelled at by the coach, laughed at and mocked by the players, and stuck doing thankless, disgusting grunt work while everyone celebrates. Hank is happy he's at least "part of a team" and convinced the hard work will make him a better person, and is utterly baffled when Bobby quits. When Bobby is being stressed out to the point of having a panic-attack from studying for a Quiz Bowl, Hank finds him stressing over such a trivial thing ridiculous, stating that Bobby's life is so easy there's nothing for him to feel stressed about.

Patti comes by and when Doug brags to her about the good shot she tells him he's "terrible" and walks off angry. For most of the episode Patti avoids Doug like the plague without giving an explanation and Doug is left wondering why she would be angry at him for wrecking a house that was going to be torn down soon anyway, even Bebe won't answer him when he asked her to find out why Patti is mad at him. He doesn't find out why until Skeeter off-handedly mentions that it was the house Patti lived in when her mother was alive, something which Doug would not have known since everybody knows he'd just moved to Bluffington.

Whenever there's an engine who laments about their unpleasant situations to others, they will always make belittling and smug insults to them about it. However, this mistreatment on the engine depends either if the engine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">brought it upon themselves due to their misbehavior</a> or that the unsympathetic engine is being rude for their own sake, in which case something will likely lead them to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATasteOfTheirOwnMedicine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATasteOfTheirOwnMedicine">A Taste of Their Own Medicine</a> shortly afterwards.
<ul><li> Henry often got this problem following his increasing illness in the first season. Other engines usually ignoring his moaning until he starts effecting their own work schedule (Thomas in particular chewed out Henry for making him late, and only saw his ill bout as an opportunity to pull his train in his place). Only his crew and Sir Topham Hatt shown concern for his health and took measures to repair him, leading him to get the last laugh on some of the apathetic engines from before when he starts to outclass them. Subverted in later seasons after his sickness reappears, where the others are usually shown to be very concerned about him.
<ul><li> Reused and reasoned in "What's The Matter With Henry?". When Henry moans he is sick again, Thomas and Percy mock him and even give him their own workload as a prank. Emily is concerned about Henry however, and upon investigating, discovers he has broken down. When Thomas and Percy realize this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization">they are remorseful</a>, explaining they thought it was just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypochondria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypochondria">Henry being his usual self</a>. The engines learning to treat Henry's wavering health more seriously is among the few Aesops that have stuck since then.
</li><li> There are times where he'll dish this to the other engines. In "Something in the Air", after Thomas explains that his lateness was due to some fish falling into his boiler and the high tide was damaging the rails, Henry brushes off this reason and rudely tells him to attach the other vans to his Flying Kipper. He does apologize to him for this in the end, however.
</li></ul></li><li> In the earlier episodes, Thomas himself often displays this treatment towards other engines who were late for his passenger trains. Along with the example with Henry as mentioned above, he shows this to Henry and James in "Better Late Than Never", dismissing their reasons for their lateness due to the viaduct being in repairs and believes it's just an excuse for laziness. Then in "Woolly Bear", he berates Percy for being late and brushes off his excuse being the hay.

Even when Fugates clothes were soaked and torn and he was obviously distressed and disheveled. (And what made it even <em>more</em> unfair was that Fugate had <em>always</em> been on time for appointments up to this point, and was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin">only late this time because Mayor Hamilton Hill (then a lawyer) had suggested he take a break for once</a>.)

This earns them the scorn of the town and their families. Their attempt to take it back fails with them getting beat up. Even when they get the booth back, it's only because the guys who bullied them reveal themselves to be soldiers who are shipping back to duty the next day. Said guys are hailed as heroes, while Peter and the gang still get no respect.

As he is overly focused on stealing all the magic from Equestria he insists that everyone surrender to him, ignoring any consequences that his enormous ego has caused.
<ul><li> A minor example comes from the episode "Secrets and Pies", where Rainbow Dash laments over decieving Pinkie Pie regarding her pies, but Twilight and Applejack don't offer their condolences on the matter, as Twilight points out she's not only lied to Pinkie, but the others as well. This prompts Applejack to ask Rainbow if she's lied about anything else, and the latter sheepishly admits she couldn't think of anything off the top of her head.

The nail in the coffin was when Toph destroyed a police report to protect her other daughter Suyin from jail time then sent her away from Republic City, when Lin was the one that arrested her and earned a nasty scar in the process of doing so.
</li><li> A (likely unintended) driving pivot of the feud in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone">The Dreamstone</a></em>. Most of Zordrak's Urpney minions (especially Frizz and Nug) hate their job, only going through with it due to Sgt. Blob and Urpgor press ganging them, or Zordrak threatening to <em>execute</em> anyone who defies him. The heroes seem aware of this (and the Urpneys are rarely shrewd about how unwilling they are) but still see the Urpneys as evil scum for trying to steal the Dreamstone and give them nightmares, usually handing them a righteous verbal lashing and cartoonish beatdown. Later episodes at least tried to make the heroes' treatment of the Urpneys more proportionate to the peril they put them through, but they remain firmly in this trope, their unwilling nature never remotely acknowledged.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLittles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLittles">The Littles</a></em> had a one off character whose father (an implied <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama">"education parent"</a>) had threatened to send her to a private school where her "friends (wouldn't) be such a bad influence on" her if she didn't get straight A's on her report card.

But most women around him for some reason feel that the most sensible way to help him save the world is by making his life as miserable as possible, and doing such things as criticizing him for being rude while trying to stop everyone else from being idiots and prepare for the last battle already. Being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHitAGirl">a total pussy</a>, Rand just accepts it. Possibly because practically all his male friends and allies give him shit if he does something like, for example, not kowtowing immediately to Aes Sedai demands for the very good reason that they are a bunch of manipulative <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkasses</a> in the midst of their own civil war, so it isn't as if he should know which ones advice to follow even were he so inclined.

This being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSide">Sith philosophy</a>, the right answer can always be found by choosing the most evil and cruel option, which the teacher will then rationalise as somehow being the most rational one in terms of maintaining your power. Hence, when one question is something like "You have a loyal and capable subordinate who hasn't failed you once before, but now does due to bad luck, what do you do?" the right answer is in the lines of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">Kill them right away</a>, because we mustn't allow any weakness."

She believes very firmly that there is only one Right Way to handle life—and that is to be detached and to deal with things rationally, stifling any emotional or knee-jerk reactions in order to be objective. This stems from her own coping mechanism of avoidance. Sometimes her input is helpful to the other characters, but other times it's markedly less so.

Thief is out solely to enrich himself at the expense of every other living creature in the cosmos, Red Mage is delusional narcissist, and Black Mage is so evil the only avatar that was fit to represent just how evil he was, was a mirror image of himself. Only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate">Fighter</a> shows any sympathy for others out of the four, and even then, he's usually too stupid to register any need for it. A running joke is for one of them to reference some atrocity (usually one of the several times they destroyed Onrac) that they (usually Black Mage) had caused, only for one of them (usually Black Mage) to either say that the victims deserved it, or that it wasn't really their fault through some ridiculous contrivance.

Fox was the sweeter natured partner, but was empathically useless, needing to have a person's problems spelled out for him before he realized there <em>was</em> a problem. After being made aware of a situation, he was quick to offer support - but if no-one bothered to explain things to him, he was cheerfully oblivious and steamrolllered their feelings. Collin, on the other hand, was more sensitive, but also crueler - appealing to his emotions was a lost cause if you weren't his nearest and dearest, and occasionally he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">actively targeted</a> someone's weak spot to demoralize them, as he did to Kitty in the "Pirates!" storyline. The endgame of the story is brought about when these two sides of the same problem clash - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Collin becomes unhappy, and Fox moves from being the one person he opens up to, to just about the only person he refuses to voice his problems to, preferring to bitch to his friend, Arath, and flirt with newcomer Leon rather than do something sensible like <em>talk to Fox</em>.

His lack of sympathy is elaborated on in a flashback; not only did he show sympathy towards the boy who'd end up responsible for hospitalising Gray's best friend, but his classmates all stood back and let it happen out of fear that they'd be targeted next. From then on, he reasons that sympathy is highly unnecessary.

<ul><li> Many employees are treated this way when calling in sick for work. Places of business usually require a doctor's note even when the employee in question may either be too sick to visit a doctor on their own or not have an illness severe enough to warrant a doctor's visit. Justified, however, in that without a doctor's note anyone could feign sickness in order to skip work.

</dd></dl></li><li> The <em>F*ck My Life</em> website is part catharsis, part concrete proof of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSympathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSympathy">No Sympathy</a>. There are two buttons beneath each post - "I agree, your life sucks" and "You deserved it." Sometimes even the softest hearted reader has to admit they kind of did it to themselves, but even if the original poster was mugged, attacked, humiliated, heartbroken or injured, there will always be a few <em>hundred</em> people who click the "You Deserved It" button. (though there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GIFT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GIFT">G.I.F.T.</a> to blame too) Especially if the poster has let slip that they are an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTarget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTarget">Acceptable Target</a> in some way. Though this has been averted in more recent times where stories where the poster couldn't have possibly deserved it have the "You Deserved It" button replaced with "That Could Have Happened To Me". There are also a handful of inversions where people who were clearly at fault still have several people voting "Your Life Sucks" (on top of the fact that a sufficient amount of users had to agree with that statement for the post to make it onto the site to begin with).
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, telling someone suffering from depression to "buck up" or "get over it already" are examples of this trope. In practice it's just as absurd as telling them to "just get over" a broken arm, although provided you've taken the right steps early on the broken arm will usually sort itself out in time, while the depression will probably be something they have to deal with their entire lives.
<ul><li> It's especially bad for people who are constantly told <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToWorseProblems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToWorseProblems">their life could be worse</a>, as if that's supposed to make them feel better. If you're truly depressed, you are physiologically incapable of seeing any hope in your situation.
</li></ul></li><li> Although disability fraud (pretending to have a debilitating condition so you can get government benefits without working) is real, some cases of alleged disability fraud may result from this trope. Consider the following: Bob has degenerative disc disease (a back condition, look it up <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disc_disease">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> if you like), and is unable to work because of it. Alice, his wife, sees that he has plenty of time on his hands and expects him to do some home improvement. In addition, Junior, their son, wants Bob to play with him, running races, playing ball, among other physical games. Bob knows that, if he spends so much as a few hours doing what his wife and son expect of him, he will be laid up for weeks. (The legal standard for disability is that if you cannot work for eight hours a day, forty hours a week, on a regular and continuing basis, you are entitled to benefits). Nevertheless, his family keeps nagging, and he finally gives in. Unfortunately, a local journalist doing an exposé on disability fraud picks that exact moment to stop by Bob's house, with a camera. The ensuing scandal is compounded by the fact that people will only see Bob apparently working hard or having a good time, and will not see the weeks of misery that follow, even aside from the popular misconception that to be disabled you have to be completely unable to do anything at all, not just on a regular and continuing basis as defined above.
</li><li> People with chronic illness often get this trope from people who don't see them very often. Chronic illness sufferers often have days where they're better than normal and can get a lot done, and deliberately use these days to power through chores they couldn't do otherwise; alternatively, knowing a big event is coming up, many people with a chronic illness will lie low for days before hand to save up energy to go to it. People who don't have to deal with the illness often get exasperated that the friend or colleague who used to do so much no longer participates so much and it's common for people with chronic illnesses to be accused of faking it because "you were fine yesterday".
</li><li> Talk to people who have had careers in law enforcement, and you will often get shades of this. Years of seeing people commit horrendous acts then play the victim diminishes their ability to empathize with certain types of people.
</li><li> Unfortunately, this has been known to happen in schools. In one of many hypothetical examples, a student who takes great care to follow the rules (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight">within reason</a>) studies for a test, but (supposedly)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4a7cd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4a7cd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4a7cd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In some cases, it may be perceived this way, but it may or may not actually be the case.</span> misbehaves and is sent to the corner / detention / etc. while the test is going on. By the time the student gets out, the test is over, but the student is not allowed to take a makeup test for whatever reason, and in some cases faces having to repeat the grade the student was in, all because the student somehow "should have thought about that before" he / she "misbehaved". This is especially bad if the student was punished unfairly, especially if the teacher is manipulative or otherwise abusive. It could even include another student causing it all to happen, and either getting away with it, or getting them both punished<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5syy3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5syy3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5syy3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In some cases, the student may have to face the "life / the world isn't fair" explanation.</span>.
</li><li> This can also be a trait of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama">"education parents"</a> who expect their sons or daughters to have high grades for whatever reason.
</li><li> A particularly horrifying example: When Timothy McVeigh, the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_bombing">Oklahoma City bomber<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, learned that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">19 little kids died in his bombing</a>, he chillingly replied "I have no sympathy for them" and described them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">"Collateral damage"</a>. Needless to say, the jury quickly returned a guilty verdict and recommended the death penalty.
