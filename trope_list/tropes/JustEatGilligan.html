But sometimes one person is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone">so repeatedly and hopelessly incompetent</a> that the audience takes notice. If one character (or some other factor), is the main reason for <em>every</em> failure, why does the rest of the cast not account for that? Why do they keep Gilligan around? Why don't they just shoot him?

</p><p>Note that there's no guarantee that ditching Gilligan would result in the show's resolution, but there's at least enough potential there to make it <em>worth a try</em>.
</p><p>Take note of the fact that you can't both be <em>able</em> to write for major network television <em>and</em> not see this glaringly obvious stuff yourself. Overlooking it is either a wink to the audience about this being, you know, fiction and stuff, or a comment on the reasoning abilities of the characters. We, for example, have no problem believing the other castaways on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilligansIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilligansIsland">Gilligan's Island</a></em> would all miss an easy observation, for one reason or another.
</p><p>The trope name comes from a question raised by Tom Servo during the riffing in an early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em> episode (<em>SST Death Flight</em>).

<ul><li> There was a series of Eggo Waffles commercials where a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad">Bumbling Dad</a> was constantly trying to steal the eponymous waffles from his daughter while she wasn't looking with his attempts always ending in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries">Amusing Injuries</a>. Honestly, why doesn't he just get his own Eggos out of the freezer, or better yet, buy himself some Eggo Waffles from the store?
</li><li> Also, the kids from the Lucky Charms commercials; why don't they just buy their own, instead of chasing Lucky for them all the time?
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedlyFreeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedlyFreeGame">Allegedly Free Game</a> for iOS and Android, <em>State of Survival</em>, the ads for the game seem to present the zombies as fairly incompetent - the fast type, yet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfPlasticine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfPlasticine">Made of Plasticine</a> - and docile until someone gets their attention through excessive noise. The family in the ads own a pit bull who always seems to ruin their day, because the dog <em>just won't shut up.</em> Cue the dog drawing the attention of the zombies (represented by stolen <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SevenDaysToDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SevenDaysToDie">7 Days to Die</a></em> assets) and forcing the family to leave safety for a woefully unfortified area. Since this seems to happen so often, why don't the family either train their animal to have restraint, or just get rid of it altogether and look for a more reliable companion, <em>or</em> (more drastically) just leave it there <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatTheDog">and let the zombies take care of the animal</a>, if not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog">do it themselves</a>?
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/TrixRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/TrixRabbit">Trix Rabbit</a> commercials. Why can't the rabbit buy some Trix instead of stealing from a bunch of random kids?
<ul><li> One advert had him taking the long-suggested "buy your own cereal" option, only for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidsAreCruel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidsAreCruel">the kids</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">to steal it from him.</a>
</li><li> The rabbit's guest appearance in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/GotMilk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/GotMilk">Got Milk?</a> commercial had him take the "buy your own" option as well, only for him to run out of milk. Though nothing's stopping him from just putting the costume back on and going out to buy milk.

One of the Musketeers wonders why the bandit that was chasing them didn't just go out and <em>buy</em> one of their candy bars.
</li><li> For many years, the Maytag Repairman has had to find all sorts of ways to keep busy because Maytag appliances never need his services. Why doesn't he just quit his job and find another instead of being a non-working repairman for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TonkaTough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TonkaTough">Tonka Tough</a> washing machine brand? For that matter, why does Maytag keep him employed if there's no need for him?

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>:
<ul><li> The anime features several occasions where a bad guy could achieve his goal without an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelsDecideEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelsDecideEverything">obligatory Duel</a>, but nevertheless does one for some unknown reason. Repeatedly lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries">Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series</a></em>. From the first season:
<div class="indent"><strong>Yami Yugi:</strong> Did you even consider <em>just asking me for</em> (the Millennium Puzzle)? I mean, do you have any <em>idea</em> how much time and money you've wasted with this whole facade? People have <em>died</em> because you wanted a necklace! <em>I killed a gay clown</em>, for Ra's sake!
</div></li><li> And again in the second season...
<div class="indent"><strong>Rare Hunter:</strong> We are here to take your rarest card. <br/><strong>Joey:</strong> You mean you're gonna kick the crap out of me and steal it? <br/><strong>Rare Hunter:</strong> No. First we will challenge you to a children's card game. <em>Then</em> we will kick the crap out of you and steal it. <br/><strong>Joey:</strong> ... wouldn't it be much easier just to skip the first step? <br/><strong>Rare Hunter:</strong> Yes. Yes, it would. (<em>proceeds with card game</em>)
</div></li><li> And in one of Marik's Evil Council meetings:
<div class="indent"><strong>Marik:</strong> We are going to challenge him to a card game! But this will be no ordinary card game. This one will take place... On a boat! <br/><strong>Bakura:</strong> Why a boat? <br/><strong>Marik:</strong> Because, uhm, when he loses the card game, we'll, uh, throw him over the edge. Into the sea. His hair will be soaked, it'll take him hours to dry it! <br/><strong>Bakura:</strong> Why do we even need to play a card game? Why can't we just push him off the boat? <br/>(<em>long pause</em>) <br/><strong>Marik:</strong> <strong>No!</strong> The card game is integral to the plot! The EVIL plot! Of which I am the evil mastermind!
</div></li><li> And from the same Council Meeting:
<div class="indent"><strong>Marik:</strong> For the last time, we're not killing him!

</div></li><li> Sometimes it follows a reasonable logic where Yugi's puzzle will only give up its true powers if someone wins it in a competition which is why we get situations like when Bandit Keith will actually steal the puzzle and THEN stop to duel Yugi anyway. The original manga's version of the Dungeon Dice Monsters arc seems to confirm that you can't just take the puzzle and then expect to be able to use it; Ryuji's father tries to reassemble the puzzle after breaking it, and the puzzle itself starts showing him illusions that cause him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">Freak Out</a> and set the building on fire. Of course, this doesn't apply to all the non-Yugi duels that go through the card game for no reason, such as the above Joey quote which really is as nonsensical in the anime as it sounds abridged.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em> manga, Misawa admits that he could have just asked Judai for Asuka's phone number instead of dueling with him, but that his pride would not allow him to do so, and that he wanted to duel Judai.
</li><li> But it's in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em> series where they really went too far with it. The police have this device that forces a duel between themselves and the vehicle they're pursuing, which can disable the other vehicle... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries">but only if they defeat the other driver in a children's card game</a>. Bonus points because if they lose that children's card game THEIR vehicle gets disabled. You really have to wonder how someone got away with a pitch for standard-issue police gear that has a built-in function to let criminals get away.
</li><li> Even more painful is that duels of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV">Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V</a></em> series, duels have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight">Solid Vision</a> to make the cards real, and it becomes portable in season 2. However, it's only used once by the main characters in a non-duel situation, to break out of prison, and even that ended with them dueling again. This power could have easily united them when they were separated, or busted their friends when they become slaves later on. Likewise, Security also has access to Solid Vision, but has only been shown using it to stop duelists from simply running away from duels. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Averted with Jean-Michel Roget, though: he has Security hold the city council hostage with Solid Vision monsters.</span>

The problem then becomes that most of the people in charge of things are hyper-competent chessmaster-types that kept little slivers here and there as backup and/or were crazy-obsessed enough to keep the damn thing around for the sake of proving themselves right, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope">which shouldn't have stopped others</a> like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheHonestOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheHonestOnes">Matsuda</a> from doing that, just in case.

<ul><li> When Ash competes in a Pokémon League tournament his team usually only consists of the Pokémon he caught in that particular region. He would have a far higher chance of winning if he had Professor Oak switch in a team made up of the strongest Pokémon that he's acquired from the various regions he's visited. In the Sinnoh league, however, he actually uses Pokemon from the previous regions he visited. He reaches semifinals, the furthest he ever got to (until the Kalos league) although he's defeated in the semifinals by a trainer with multiple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Olympus Mons</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eventually, he finally wins a League in Alola.</span>
</li><li> Team Rocket is best known for trying to steal Pikachu, but they just as often try to steal Pokémon from other people or places. If they simply waited for Ash and his friends to leave whoever they wanted to rob they could do so unhindered. Furthermore, Pokémon they want to steal are often wild or unowned, meaning that instead of using complicated traps and plans to steal them they could simply capture them in Poké Balls and Ash and his friends wouldn't be able to do anything about it. The show even enjoys poking fun of this. Most of Jessie and James' legitimate captures are hilariously effortless. It is also noted that after the events of Sea Temple in Unova, Giovanni himself wanted Pikachu specifically after witnessing it's power firsthand and set him as the Jessie and James' primary target, explaining why they couldn't just snatch one from the wild.

Now, his gung-ho, gun-loving attitude is supposed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, and he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>, really, but just the same, getting rid of him would've saved SV2 of manu troubles. Note that in the manga version, Ohta is shown to be less incompetent than his anime counterparts. Also note that one of the later TV shows, points out that Ohta <em>is</em> very skilled, "He's never hit a cockpit," Gotoh remarks. Besides, the only other suitable pilots were on command track/or slated to go back to the US in a year. This is reinforced in the second movie, where he cooly demonstrates that he's capable of aiming from the hip with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> and nailing a moving target.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>, the heroine has the ability to travel back and forth in time to Ancient Japan. Presumably, she and her friends who remain in the past after the defeat of Naraku could arrange to preserve the information on how it was done in such a way that Kagome could easily discover it in the present, take the information back to the <em>past</em> where the as-yet-undefeated Naraku is still wreaking havoc and use it to defeat him. Of course, trying to explain the logistics of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">such a paradox-based plan</a> would most likely make all of the characters heads' explode, which would <em>itself</em> end the series <em>right there.</em> But of course, that depends on the exact logistics of the time travel, and, judging from the amount of present-day school she misses, the amount of time she can go back and forth is fixed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlueSeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlueSeed">Blue Seed</a></em> has this as its central concept. If they had just killed Momiji (normally, that is), the monsters would all be gone and peace would be restored. However, the basis of the series is to find a way to get rid of the monsters without killing her. It's directly discussed at one point in the series that earlier Kushinadas had been sacrificed during the Rite of Matsuri throughout history and the effects of their sacrifices in order to put down the Aragami were only temporary. The characters in the series recognize this and actively try to find a long-term solution.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> would have ended much sooner in Lelouch's favor had he abandoned his favoritism and made a much earlier attempt to kill his best friend turned rival Suzaku, or geassed Villetta into forgetting everything that happened during their first encounter. Even sooner if he'd simply made some <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Follow all of my orders"</span> commands, which he finally begins throwing around near the end of the second season. There are some (admittedly fairly flimsy) reasons for not doing these things: Lelouch's personal brand of selfishness makes him willing to do anything for the people he cares about at the expense of everyone else (he started his entire war for the sake of his little sister), so it is a recognizable character flaw for him to hold back on Suzaku. He also dislikes taking away people's freedom (it's one of the reasons he hates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Brittannia</a>), so he only geasses innocent people temporarily, and his finally being willing to go that extra mile is a sign of his general breakdown. Yes, there is a lot of ambiguity and hypocrisy in his personal code of ethics (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocrisyNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocrisyNod">which he's well aware of</a>), but he does actually have a reason for not solving his problems this way. His failure to deal with Viletta properly (either by geass or by execution) is certainly a stupid oversight, but could be excused by the stress of his first battle and newly-found powers causing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">What an Idiot!</a> moment. Partially justified (at least for Viletta) in that Lelouch did not know the limits of his Geass when he used it on her. He only learned his one-use limit during a subsequent episode in which he attempted to geass Kallen twice in a row.

<ul><li> Not one single character who has gained a curse at the Jusenkyō springs has thought to take a dip in whatever spring would cure them before they leave, despite there being a helpful guide there who happens to know what curse each spring carries. Several episode plots revolve around trying to get back to Jusenkyō, even, and no one explains why they left to begin with.
</li><li> There is also a storyline which involves a bar of soap that apparently cures the curse. However at the end of the story we discover that the fix is only temporary. However, it didn't seem to occur to the characters that they could have continued immunity to the curse if they used it every day like, say, one does with a bar of soap.
</li><li> Or for the matter when they need to go to China to find the spring to cure their curse why not just take a boat or plane to get there. Ranma could have just swum to China like they did before.

Haruhi is, unbeknownst to herself, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a>, and they don't want her to find out because she might bring about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a>. But she's come close to discovering her powers numerous times, and she's reset the universe once or twice accidentally, so they're only delaying the inevitable. If they just told her directly, at least it wouldn't happen suddenly and unexpectedly. Maybe she could learn to control or suppress her powers consciously. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">Kyon tries to tell her, but she doesn't believe him, but he later invents what he thinks is a surefire way to convince her.</a> Several novels later, he still hasn't tried it.

Although given the nature and extent of her powers, neither would likely work, so her friends might as well make contact with one of a magical being she thinks is real like a fairy and wish Haruhi out of existence.

<ul><li> The fourth season, <em>SuperS</em>, has a new group of mysterious enemies show up to assault the people of Tokyo. All their monsters are circus-themed, and at the same time, a gigantic, sinister-looking circus tent just shows up in the middle of town without explanation. It's bigger than any building in the city and sticks out like a sore thumb. The Sailor Senshi are among the first to notice it. And then they just go about their lives, refusing to put two and two together and often wondering aloud where all these new enemies could possibly be coming from. Averted in the manga where the Senshi are on to the Dead Moon Circus from almost the beginning of the arc.
</li><li> In the second season, <em>R</em>, because of the recent attacks by the Makai Tree Aliens, Luna ends up having to restore the memories of Usagi and the other Inner Guardians to combat this new threat. When it comes to trying to restore the memories of Mamoru (aka Tuxedo Mask), however, Luna never thinks of doing the same thing to him. Even if it wasn't possible due to Mamoru originally being from the Earth Kingdom instead of the Moon Kingdom in Usagi's previous life as Princess Serenity, it could've been worth a try at least.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Double Subversion</a> early on during the Saiyan Saga. When the group gathers the Dragon Balls to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">resurrect Goku,</a> Oolong suggests that they could just wish to kill the evil Saiyans who are on their way to Earth, explaining that if it works they can bring Goku back at their leisure. However, Shenlong explains that wishes can't exceed the power of his creator Kami, and since both of the Saiyans are far stronger than him, such a wish wouldn't work. This also serves to explain why they don't try this tactic again in later story arcs. This becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark">Voodoo Shark</a>, as observed by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DragonBallZAbridged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DragonBallZAbridged">Dragon Ball Z Abridged</a></em>: While Shenlong can't <em>directly</em> kill the Saiyans, nobody comes up with the idea of killing them <em>in</em>directly, by making a wish like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VehicularSabotage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VehicularSabotage">Scramble their navigation systems</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">so they fly into a star</a>", or, more simply, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomebodySetUpUsTheBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomebodySetUpUsTheBomb">Make their spaceships explode before they get to Earth</a>".
<ul><li> Bulma generally serves as something of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceSurrogate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceSurrogate">Audience Surrogate</a> for this purpose - whenever an obvious solution to a problem comes up, she's usually the one to point it out. Examples include asking why they couldn't just use the Dragon Balls to kill Raditz (they couldn't gather the Dragon Balls in time) or locate Dr. Gero's lab (The main characters are fight-hungry idiots). Of course, in the latter case, Future Trunks was afraid that if they hadn't trained, Vegeta wouldn't get with Bulma and he might not exist, although he does eventually find out this wasn't necessary. Besides, if they had found Dr. Gero's lab before, they would have all been killed by Cell anyway.
</li><li> In general, a lot of these plans either have backdoor reasons why it would've went really poorly if they went through with them, or the villains past the Saiyans are just extremely resilient or have regenerative abilities. Frieza survived an exploding planet after getting cut in half and blown away by Goku. At that point it's just pragmatic to expend all focus in making sure the problem is dealt with first hand.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first arc, when the Black Star Dragon Balls got scattered throughout the galaxy, the Z Fighters thought it was best to build a spaceship and search for them, planet by planet, one at a time. However, the idea of simply using the normal Dragon Balls to wish for all the Black Star ones to appear on Earth never comes up. While this could easily be explained as being outside of Shenron's power (An explanation used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> when it was faced with a similar problem) it comes off as odd that there isn't even a throwaway line explaining this. Not even Bulma suggests it, despite her normally being the one to suggest using the Dragon Balls to solve their problems.
</li><li> Again in episode 7-8 of <em>GT</em>. A monster named Zoonama threatens to destroy a village with earthquakes unless they give him a bride (it later turns out that Zoonama was only bluffing and doesn't actually have the power to cause earthquakes). For some reason the Z Fighters thought it was best to dress Trunks as a woman, get Zoonama to marry him, then cut off Zoonama's earthquake-causing whiskers while he was asleep during their honeymoon. At no point do the Z Fighters consider just beating up Zoonama and tearing off his whiskers, drive him out of the village, or at the very least, attempting a sneak attack.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheHatingGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheHatingGirl">The Hating Girl</a></em>'s central plot point is that the main female character has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingArrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingArrows">an arrow through her head</a> because of a childhood archery accident, which has caused her a lot of physical and emotional pain over the years.

One of the cast, Joseph, has the ability Hermit Purple, which gives him a decent array of divination abilities (creating pictures of the person, making detailed maps of a location, getting film of a specific place). In fact, the reason he's involved in the series to begin with is that they figured they could use his powers to help track down a different criminal. Despite this, nobody so much as suggests to Joseph that he could use his power to at least help locate the killer.
<ul><li> The reason for that was because Joseph was becoming increasingly senile over the course of the story, and thus his ability became more and more difficult to use.

Episode 62 (one of the episodes where the trio went back in time) reveals that Younger!Dorothy used a spell to change her hair color because Younger!Seravy wouldn't participate in a magic duel she challenged him to. Wouldn't it have been easier for Younger!Seravy to man up and fight her instead of making Younger!Dorothy make her hair "ugly" in his eyes, or better yet, why couldn't Chacha convince Younger!Seravy to man up and fight her while she was still in the past?

However, since mutant negation technology is widely available (and has been shown to work on her in the past), it should be no problem to simply make a necklace or something with the embedded technology and just put an on/off switch on the circuit. End of meaningless brooding. Note, however, that this depends on which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">incarnation</a> is discussed, as well as what the technology does specifically. In <em>Evolution</em>, Nightcrawler's hologram machine is only able to change the appearance but is still a blue furry humanoid with three fingers on each hand. The animated series had devices that nullified powers on the mutant-hating Genosha, but the controllers would be a hassle to carry everywhere and she would need to hide it so it does not get damaged or turned against her. <br/><br/>The implicit explanation usually was that power-negating devices belonged to villains and thus were not freely available, or they weren't exactly devices so much as actual living persons (such as Leech of the Morlocks or Wipeout, the power-negating mutant serving with the Genoshan Press Gang). In <em>X-Men vs. Alpha Flight</em> Rogue was briefly given the ability to control her power by Anodyne, a normal human given healing powers by Loki, but Rogue gave up her control when it emerged that the process that had given Anodyne her powers had the side-effect of killing magically-based superheroes like Alpha Flight's Shaman and Snowbird. In one story written by Scott Lobdell, Joseph (later revealed to be Magneto's clone) created a device that allowed Rogue to skin-to-skin contact without negating Rogue's powers. It was not surprisingly promptly forgotten. However, all of this is now moot since Rogue eventually became able to control her power in <em>X-Men Legacy</em>.
</li><li> Back when the Legacy Virus was ravaging Marvel's mutant population, a common fan suggestion was to intentionally infect Wolverine with the virus and use his antibodies to develop a cure.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>:
<ul><li> Many fans have, for a long time, been shouting for Batman to Just Kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a>. The fact that Batman <em>knows</em> his arch-enemy will eventually kill again — inasmuch as the Joker has killed numerous people <em>while locked up in Arkham</em> — arguably makes him complicit in the death, suffering, and terror spread by the Clown Prince of Crime. This further suggests that Bruce puts his own pride and moral high ground above innocent lives... which therefore destroys his moral high ground. Batman has actually been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">called out on this</a> multiple times; the counter-argument, in recent times when he's bothered to give one, is that Batman fears that if he crosses that line, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters">there will be no turning back</a>. Again, in recent times and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>, Batman is not always depicted as being completely in the right on this stance. Compounding the issue is the fact that not only has Batman passed on opportunities to (entirely legally) kill the Joker, he has <em>actively intervened to stop</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan">heroes with a different moral code</a> from finishing off the psychopath, including perhaps most infamously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a>. Also bear in mind, on a memorable occasion when he finally went "fuck it" and tried to kill the Joker (in <em>Batman: Hush</em>), it was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCommissionerGordon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCommissionerGordon">The Commissioner Gordon</a></em> himself that stopped him, saying that if he tried to do that, he would consider Batman no better than the other mad-dog psychos over on Arkham and he would do whatever it took to take him down. Batman, thus, decided to stop — because he considers Gordon a friend, and he knows he needs Gordon on his side to be effective in his war.
</li><li> Barbara Gordon was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batgirl">Batgirl</a>, but was then crippled by the Joker in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheKillingJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheKillingJoke">The Killing Joke</a>.</em> After that, she used her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusCripple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusCripple">keen intellect</a> to become the heroic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowledgeBroker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowledgeBroker">Knowledge Broker</a> Oracle. For years, there was the underlying question: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InAWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InAWorld">In a World...</a> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">Death Is Cheap</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceHero">Science Heroes</a> are shown healing all sorts of ailments worse than Barbara's, why is she still in a wheelchair? The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist">Doylist</a> answer is that most people prefer Barbara as Oracle and its related <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> and that she's one of the best examples of disabled inclusion in comics. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, she said that she wouldn't use her connections to get any sort of treatment unavailable to the public. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a> finally (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">and controversially</a>) had her regain her mobility and become Batgirl again (and every once in a while she feels ashamed as a result).
</li><li> In <em>Batman: Devil's Advocate</em>, the crux of the tale is that the Gotham City justice system just has had enough of the Joker and when he's arrested for apparently going on a serial killing spree with his signature Smilex, he's given the death penalty and then when Batman discovers that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMeThisTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMeThisTime">the Smilex scheme was done by someone else</a> (a man who found one of Joker's old weapons caches and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKillingsSpecificTarget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKillingsSpecificTarget">used it to kill his wife and a few other people to mask it</a>), nobody wants to hear it, not even Commissioner Gordon. And when Batman eventually manages to obtain iron-clad proof, back to Arkham the Joker goes, just like that.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> is widely known for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualPoverty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualPoverty">Perpetual Poverty</a> even though both fans and writers often point out many ways he could make plenty of cash.
<ul><li> Peter can't hold down a full time job due to his activities as Spider-Man. He could easily ask Tony Stark, the Avengers, SHIELD or any of the other extremely wealthy people and organizations he's allies with for a job that's flexible enough for him to do superhero work.
</li><li> Peter also often complains that he can't license his likeness or get paid for media appearances without revealing his true identity. However, when he guest taught a class at Avengers Academy his charges informed him that he could have started a LLC and made money hands over fist while still keeping his identity secret. Spidey is so flustered and taken aback that he immediately changes the subject.
</li><li> This was finally addressed in a storyline where Peter took over Doctor Octopus's company after it was renamed Parker Industries.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note02obk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note02obk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note02obk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Technically, Doc Ock did the renaming while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">possessing Peter's body</a>, but Peter continued to run the company after he regained control of himself.</span> Unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">the company was later ruined</a> as a result of a struggle between Peter and Doc Ock.

<ul><li> There have been numerous characters that have enough mystical power to defeat Dr. Eggman themselves, yet no-one ever does this. Some of these characters are relatives of Tails and Knuckles, who could honestly say they're protecting their homes and families. Tails and Knuckles themselves have gained power enough to defeat Eggman on two separate occasions each, typically becoming reality warpers of various degrees, yet it never occurs to them to personally take out Eggman, even when they <em>do</em> have non-lethal measures available to them. Interestingly, the comic does come up with an answer: the multiverse would just dump another Dr. Eggman on their laps. As Zonic the Zone Cop tells Sonic, Sonic must fight Robotnik. However, the Mobius: X Years Later suggests that <em>killing</em> Robotnik is what's needed; there would be new threats but Robotnik/Eggman wouldn't return in any form.
</li><li> Power Rings have the ability to grant its user's greatest wish and the main source of Power Rings is located near the heroes' home city. This is why Ian Flynn only occasionally used the Rings in his run of the comics as he acknowledged that there was nothing stopping the Freedom Fighters from simply wishing for world peace.
</li></ul></li><li> As a general issue in comic books, there was the question of why the superheroes who were active during World War II seemed to spend the war fighting criminals and saboteurs in America, rather than flying to Berlin and using their powers to overthrow Hitler and end the war. DC eventually came up with an explanation: Hitler had a magic artifact called the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Lance">Spear of Destiny<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which is the lance the pierced the side of Jesus Christ when the son of God was crucified. One of its powers was that any superhero who entered territory that was under Hitler's control would lose his powers or fall under Hitler's domination. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheGoldenAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheGoldenAge">The Golden Age</a></em> had the explanation become the cover story for the <em>actual</em> reason: The Nazis had an agent, codenamed Parsifal, whose power allowed him to shut down others' powers. Rather than risk the death of valuable superhumans, the government preferred to keep the option off the table until they had killed Parsifal.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em> required one to believe that absolutely <em>nobody</em> outside of the team could possibly understand their motives for wanting to stick together instead of going into foster care. This finally ended with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersAcademy">Avengers Academy</a></em>, when Nico uses magic to create a mind-meld with the Avengers.

Paul mentions that the wizard Shaamforouz (whom they have grown to distrust) said that the Black Tower would destroy the amulet of mask-breaking if it was really that powerful. Ringo dismisses that by pointing out that it's useful to other people besides him, so why would they destroy something that useful just because there's a vague chance the good guys might get it? He also points out, with devastating logic, that the Amber Staff is a lot more dangerous for the Black Tower to let exist, because it's the centerpiece of the Nine-part Key, so why haven't they just destroyed it, or put it on a moon or something, which would instantly make it impossible for anyone to conquer them?

</li><li> The third act of Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin">Aladdin</a></em> happens because Aladdin doesn't free the Genie like he promised, because he needs the Genie's magic to keep pretending to be the phony prince that was allowed to marry Jasmine. Once the Genie actually is freed, we see that he still keeps all his magical powers  with the only difference being that he is no longer compelled to grant wishes. No one seems to have considered the option of freeing the Genie earlier, and then getting him to use his magic simply out of gratitude. It's possibly justified in that Genie's magic seems to be stronger when he is a prisoner of the lamp; an episode of the sequel series even has him specifically state "my powers aren't what they used to be". "Phenomenal cosmic powers, itty-bitty living space" you know.

"Because the movie would have ended right there", he replied. Also the horses were probably the most valuable thing (to the Indians) on the stage. They didn't know about the stolen money and probably didn't know how many women were there. So if you kill the horses, all you get is the chance to rape and murder.

He should have just broken the darn thing.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> series. Why doesn't Edward turn Bella into a vampire? It would avert almost all of the conflict after the first movie. At first, it's more justified as Bella asks Edward and he refuses because he doesn't like being a vampire and doesn't want her to be one. But when it becomes clear in later installments that they're going to be together and that everyone agrees that she should become a Vampire with even Edward agreeing to do it, Edward's reluctance needlessly continues to complicate the matter. Furthermore, most of the other Cullens are on board with her becoming a vampire. They abstain from turning Bella themselves out of respect for Edward's wishes but as their lives are continually placed in jeopardy trying to protect her, you'd think eventually one of them would just turn Bella and get it over with.
<ul><li> As mentioned in Literature, most fans and haters (rather drastically) agree that the majority of the problems in the series could have avoided if Tyler's van ran Bella over in the first place.

(She's the only person who knows where she stashed a kidnap victim, so they need her alive.) As a result they try to shoot around her to pin her down so they can apprehend her. Needless to say, she escapes with ease. If just one person in the DIA had remembered that tasers exist, or tranquilizer darts, or tear gas, then the movie would have been over right there. Granted, that would also make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">The Bad Guy Win</a>...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BillAndTedsExcellentAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BillAndTedsExcellentAdventure">Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure</a></em> falls victim to this until almost the very end, when the two not-so-bright heroes finally realize that, duh, they have a time machine, and proceed to arrange it so that, in some future time, they will go back into the <em>past</em> and cause certain events to happen in the <em>present</em> which will allow them to escape from jail and make it to the school in time to deliver their fateful history report. The climax of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BillAndTedsBogusJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BillAndTedsBogusJourney">the sequel</a> features both Bill and Ted <em>and</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Nomolos DeNomolos playing this game, each attempting to get the advantage in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MexicanStandoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MexicanStandoff">Mexican Standoff</a>... until Ted rightly points out that only one side gets to win, then go back in time and stage everything just right, and they had in fact planted all the items he thought he planted to lull him into a false sense of security. Probably not so much of a concern, because the film is too silly to be taken seriously.
</li><li> A few moments in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> Saga have moments that could've solved some problems rather easily, but the characters still make some rather idiotic decisions.
<ul><li> <em>Episode I: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace">The Phantom Menace</a></em> has Qui-Gon and Queen Amidala forced to land the Naboo ship on Tatooine, since the hyperdrive is disabled, and requires a new one. Watto refuses to take Republic Credits as currency and claims that nobody else has a Naboo ship hyperdrive. As shown in Episode IV, the easy way to get off Tatooine is to hire a transport, potentially even a smuggler, rather than an overly convoluted plot to bet everything on a pod race. Especially since all they needed to do was send one person to warn everyone about the Trade Federation and then everyone else could have been picked up at their leisure.
</li><li> It is heavily implied that once Qui-Gon encountered Anakin, he became determined to free the boy from bondage and make him a Jedi. So once he met him (very shortly after landing on Tatooine), it became (in Qui-Gon's mind at least) less about escaping to Coruscant with the Queen and more about helping this Force prodigy who by all indications is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a> achieve his destiny to bring balance to The Force.
<div class="indent"><em>Finding him was the will of The Force. Nothing happens by accident.</em>
</div></li><li> <em>Episode II: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones">Attack of the Clones</a></em> offers a notorious example. During the Battle of Geonosis, Obi-Wan and Anakin spot Dooku escaping, and Anakin orders the gunship's pilot to shoot him down, but he replies that they are out of rockets. Anakin doesn't even think to order the pilot to use the gunship's laser cannons and laser beam turrets to blast Dooku away. If they did, Dooku would've been killed off, he wouldn't have escaped, the Clone War doesn't have to happen, problem solved. Even if the war still begins, the Confederacy probably would've fallen quickly without Dooku's leadership. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul">Pablo Hidalgo</a> of the Lucasfilm Story Group, whose job it basically was to explain away stuff like this, stated that the gunship's lasers were strictly air-to-surface, and flying high enough to target Dooku with them would make them easy targets for the enemy's heavy fire. A mention of this in the film would have been nice, however.
</li><li> In Legends, it is perfectly possible to quickly clone Force-sensitives (for every one success, you're likely to have ten failures that are insane or grotesquely-mutated, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">Palpatine wouldn't care</a>). Presumably, the only reason Palpatine didn't have the Kaminoans create a clone of Anakin Skywalker that he could easily raise to be totally loyal to him from the start as soon as he had access to both was his prideful desire to corrupt THE Chosen One that the Jedi put all their faith in. After Darth Vader was crippled on Mustafar, though, he has no such excuse, because we see him willing to pick up any moderately powerful young Force-user as Vader's replacement.
</li><li> In <em>A New Hope</em>, had the Imperials destroyed the supposedly-empty escape pod with R2-D2, C-3PO, and the Death Star plans, it's very likely all events in the original trilogy would have been averted; Luke would have never gotten involved in the Rebellion, gotten in touch with the Force, and so forth. As the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> spoof asks, "Hold your fire? What, are we paying by the laser now?"
</li><li> If Tarkin had called in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Star Destroyers</a> to surround Yavin IV while he moved the Death Star in to fire on it -to stop the rebels from fleeing during the several minutes it takes the Death Star to get into position and fire, if nothing else- the majority of the rebellion would have been crushed at Yavin, even if Luke had still destroyed the Death Star. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em> asked a similar question of why the remaining Imperial Fleet didn't just keep fighting the rebels at Endor even after the Emperor and Death Star were gone, but the New Canon explains that Palpatine had special contingencies in the event of his death that the Imperials were more concerned with.
</li><li> Similarly. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HowItShouldHaveEnded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HowItShouldHaveEnded">How It Should Have Ended</a></em> has Tarkin drop the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> and tell his navigators to travel by hyperspace directly to the orbit of Yavin IV rather than take the long way around, blasting the Rebel base immediately. Poor Han, he really WAS thinking of coming back to help them...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens">The Force Awakens</a></em>, Stormtrooper Captain Phasma gets caught by Finn, Han and Chewie at Starkiller Base, in an effort to lower the shields around the planet, so that the Resistance X-Wings can fly in, and destroy it. As the movie's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HowItShouldHaveEnded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HowItShouldHaveEnded">How It Should Have Ended</a></em> parody pointed out, she could've pulled off an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISurrenderSuckers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISurrenderSuckers">I Surrender, Suckers</a> moment and not lower the shields at all, and instead alert Starkiller Base to the presence of the intruders, thus preventing the dropping of the shields and ensuring the First Order's victory since the X-Wings wouldn't be able to fly into the planet and take it out. The new Expanded Universe and a deleted (and non-canon) scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi">The Last Jedi</a></em> establish that Phasma is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Coward</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">no loyalty to anyone,</a> but Finn didn't know that when he came up with the plan.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations">Star Trek: Generations</a></em>: In the Nexus, Guinan notes to Picard that he can travel to any place and any time he chooses. Picard inexplicably chooses to arrive mere <em>minutes</em> before Soran obliterated the star in the Veridian system to stop him with Kirk's help, rather than any earlier point in the film, such as his first meeting. It was even brought up by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic">The Nostalgia Critic</a> in his review of the movie.
</li><li> If <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePurge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePurge">The Purge</a></em> is strictly an American phenomena (it was instituted by the New Founding Fathers of America, and no country not run by these baby-killers would institute it), then why doesn't everyone who can afford to simply take a vacation to another country the week the Purge is set to happen, and thereby not risk getting murdered? The implication is that for those who can't afford adequate protection, it's safer to stay and protect your property than to risk it being stolen or burned down, and pay tons for the plane ticket, but what if you have children or elderly with you who can't fight? Or what if you have no property worth risking your life for that you can't take with you? Or what if you decide not to pay for the plane ticket and simply hop the Canadian or Mexican border for a week, which is trivially easy? At the very least, you'd think the dead-homeless would leave the major cities around the time of the Purge (it's not until the third film that it's mentioned that the borders are closed during the Purge to prevent this, but 1) it's not made clear about whether or not this is a new measure and 2) the question still stands, only thing that changes is the fact you can't leave during the Purge). Fortunately, the film is a metaphor for general poverty, and runs on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra">MST3K Mantra</a>.
</li><li> In many 50's monster movies, the protagonists will declare a monster immune to conventional weapons after a few torso-shots from low-caliber revolvers don't faze it, oblivious to the fact that bigger guns and more critical points on the body exist. At the very least, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DeadSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DeadSpace">Dead Space</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheLivingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheLivingDead">Return of the Living Dead</a></em> showed that even something that can't technically be killed can still be dismembered or burned until it no longer poses a threat.
</li><li> In the film adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JemAndTheHolograms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JemAndTheHolograms">Jem and the Holograms</a></em>:
<ul><li> The main characters gain access to an AI companion called Synergy, which was developed by Jem's father and has the ability to display holograms and information (not to mention that it has a design similar to BB-8 from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarWarsTheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarWarsTheForceAwakens">Star Wars: The Force Awakens</a></em>, a robot concept that proved to be a massive merchandising success in real-life). At this point, the characters are also struggling to make money in order to prevent the government from foreclosing on the aunt's house, which is in arrears. It doesn't occur to any of the girls that this robot (which has groundbreaking design technology in the film's universe) would net them a meeting with virtually any tech company out there if they chose to license it or sell the concept.
</li><li> The main conceit of the second act (that Jem leaves her friends in order to pursue a solo career with Erica Raymond and therefore get the money she needs) falls flat within the world of the film. The contract Erica gives her is vaguely worded and puts Jem in such a position that she would be an indentured slave to the company, performing shows with no expectation of payment and no guarantee of royalties or future earnings. If Jem was as famous as the film played her up as, she would have many ways of making money outside of Erica's influence — either by selling music through a third-party provider like iTunes, monetizing her videos on Youtube, booking shows herself or selling memorabilia.
</li><li> There is no adequate reason given for why Jem gives up her earrings to Erica, nor any reason given why she just doesn't ask for them back from the owner (given that they are a personal item that Erica shouldn't have any reason to want to keep them in the first place, and Jem needs them to fix Synergy). Instead, Jem and the group enact a plan that involves breaking into the record company's offices after-hours so they can steal the earrings back. This only happens so that they can find Rio's father's will that explains that he's the real owner of Starlight Records.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HappyDeathDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HappyDeathDay">Happy Death Day</a></em>, the protagonist, Tree, is stuck in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">"Groundhog Day" Loop</a> in which she is killed at the end of every day. The killer in question though, never gives Tree the impression of being anything more than a normal human <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and is in fact two people; a dangerous but untrained and under-equipped serial killer and another college girl. Tree doesn't try simply killing or incapacitating either killer until she knows their identity though, even though she could easily use the loop to get good weapons and know exactly when and where they'll strike if she follows roughly the same path each time</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>:
<ul><li> In a hotly debated topic, everybody keeps bringing up the eagles. Why don't the Fellowship just use them to fly to someplace near Mordor, and then get to Mount Doom quicker, and then drop the Ring, and end it once and for all? Interestingly, it's a case of this leading to a short story with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a>; without Gollum's interference, no one would have had the will to destroy the Ring. Also notice that it's not listed under Literature. The films do not explain the role of the eagles in Tolkien's works, but that role makes using them a touchy matter. For one thing, they say they're afraid of archers (which Sauron has in spades), they're not subtle (being giant eagles), no one knows how the Fellowship was going to enter Mordor, and to top it all off, the eagles get their marching orders from <a class="urllink" href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Eagles">God via His right hand angel<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Just as His angels, such as Gandalf, are to aid but not dominate the Free Peoples, the eagles answer to a higher power. However, nothing's stopping the Fellowship from getting Gandalf to convince God to let them use the Eagles for their mission, ditching Sauron temporarily, and then blindfolding the Eagles and flying them straight to Mordor.
</li><li> In Elrond's flashback of Isildur being corrupted by the One Ring in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheFellowshipOfTheRing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheFellowshipOfTheRing">The Fellowship of the Ring</a></em>, after Elrond tells Isildur to destroy it, Isildur declines, due to being corrupted by the Ring. Because Elrond was <em>right there</em> as Isildur was walking away, and also, since Isildur was not invisible (since he didn't put the ring on) he could've just stopped him from leaving with the Ring, and then tossed it into the lava to destroy it, which would've derailed the whole story altogether, rather than doing absolutely nothing and letting Isildur walk off with the Ring. Tolkien's own writings, however, implied that Elrond wouldn't have been able to destroy the Ring either.
</li><li> In the third movie, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheReturnOfTheKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheReturnOfTheKing">The Return of the King</a></em>, Denethor thinks Faramir died, Pippin is the only one who figured out that he was KOd from a poisoned arrow and needs medical attention. After Gandalf knocks Denethor out after he yells "Abandon your posts!", <em>no one</em>, not even Pippin himself, takes advantage of the opportunity to get Faramir to the House of Healings, or even get him medicine and have him recover! Instead, they apparently leave him unattended, and he is taken by Denethor to be burned alongside him in the Tomb of the Stewards! If Pippin had taken Faramir, all this would've been avoided!
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartII">Back to the Future Part II</a></em>:
<ul><li> The second half could've been avoided if Marty had taken the DeLorean's keys out of the ignition and close and lock the doors before wandering off to look at the Hilldale suburb. This would've prevented Biff from taking it undetected and traveling back to 1955 to give his younger self the sports almanac which he uses to bet on horse races where he gets lots of money, which he then later becomes rich and powerful, corrupts Hill Valley, murders Marty's dad, George McFly, forced Lorraine into marrying him, and had Doc sent to an insane asylum.
</li><li> During the third act, Marty learns that Old!Biff gave the almanac to Young!Biff in 1955 and that Young!Biff earned his first million(s) in 1958 by betting on the ponies after turning 21. That gives Doc and Marty about a three-year span of time to steal the almanac back from Young!Biff, rather than going to November 12th, 1955, the day Old!Biff went to to give his younger self the almanac, and risk running into 1955!Doc and Part I!Mart. Alternatively, if they still think it would've been better to get rid of the almanac as soon as possible to minimize any changes to the timeline and because they probably don't know where else Biff is besides that date, they could have just waited until about 3am on the day of the Under the Sea Dance (after the storm had passed) and stolen it while he was asleep or whatever. All of the urgency of the third act in Part II is incredibly forced.

Additionally, it doesn't cross Junior's mind to tell his mother the truth until near the end.

<ul><li> Many reviews love to point out that since Thanos's goal is to fix what he perceives to be overpopulation and diminishing resources problems, he could've just used the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Infinity Gauntlet</a> to create never ending resources or alter the universe's fertility rate instead of killing half of the universe. Perhaps the heroes could have even <em>aided</em> Thanos in assembling the Infinity Stones rather than putting up the <em>sheer</em> resistance we see in this film.
</li><li> Another notable case of this trope becomes apparent during the scene where Dr. Strange, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Mantis and Drax attempt to pry the Infinity Gauntlet off Thanos's arm, which ultimately fails when an enraged, grief-stricken Quill wrecks their attempt and allows Thanos to snap out of his Mantis-induced trance. Keep in mind that Dr. Strange is a powerful sorcerer who can open portals leading into nearly anywhere in the universe, which are also shown to inflict clean <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalCut">Portal Cuts</a>; if he had though of putting Thanos's arm through a portal and closed it while it was halfway through, the team wouldn't have had a hard time preventing the death of half the universe in the first place.

<ul><li> The Siege of Earth in the second tome of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EmpireFromTheAshes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EmpireFromTheAshes">Dahak</a></em> trilogy, "Armageddon Inheritance". For those who don't know the book: Earth's moon is in fact a spaceship so powerful it makes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Death Star</a> look like a piece of junk, and the titular Dahak is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentAI">Benevolent A.I.</a> controlling it. Sometime before the aforementioned Siege, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Colin</a> gets his hands on over 70 warships that make <em>Dahak</em> look like a piece of junk, but he doesn't have enough crew for all of them and their computers are complete idiots, which is why he needs Dahak to control them. There are two types of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel">Faster-Than-Light Travel</a> in the series: Enchanach Drive (warp drive by a different name) and Hyperdrive which is 3 times faster but doesn't allow communication during transit. Since they need Dahak to control most of the ships they travel by Enchanach Drive and reach the Earth <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">7 months after the Siege has started, and barely make it in time to save Earth (and a billion people have died already)</span>. This trope comes into play when you remember that while he didn't have the crew for <em>all</em> ships he <em>did</em> have the crew for <em>some</em> ships and he <em>could</em> have sent these few manned ships by Hyperdrive arriving much earlier before the siege even started. Considering how powerful the ships were, even one or two could've defeated the bad guys that attacked during the Siege with ease.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JourneyToTheWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JourneyToTheWest">Journey to the West</a></em>, almost every story features Xuanzang believing Zhu Bajie's lies about Wukong, taking his bad advice, or taking his side in arguments. He gets captured by demons as a result, and despite this happening dozens of times in the story, he never realizes that Bajie is always wrong. Every single time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the second book, why did Alice not just call someone to check if Bella is dead since, presumably, she knows that her visions aren't always set in stone and can be altered? Why did she not wait to tell her family what was going on before she left to confirm what was up? It couldn't have taken more than a day or so to figure out, and it would certainly save Edward the trouble of thinking Bella's dead after leaping to conclusions from calling her father, who happened to be at a funeral.
</li><li> Or if Edward had asked to speak with Bella, rather than Charlie, when he called, thereby avoiding the whole misunderstanding caused by Jacob saying that Charlie was arranging a funeral. Or if Jacob had said whose funeral Charlie was arranging (even something vague like "a friend"). Really, just one of any number of things could have prevented the whole thing from happening.
</li><li> On the subject of <em>Twilight</em>, it would have saved a whole lot of trouble if the Cullens had just banded all seven of themselves together and ripped off the heads of the three vampires threatening Bella. One could argue that the Cullens were trying to be more peaceful than that, but their immediate plan <em>after</em> James and Victoria are out of sight and making plans of their own is to lure the two vampires away and <em>kill</em> them!
</li><li> <em>Eclipse</em> would have been a <em>lot</em> shorter if the Cullens decided to drop on by Seattle and have a quick look in on the newborn who was going on an insane killing spree if only to keep away the Volturi if not to prevent further human deaths.
</li><li> If Bree Tanner had realized that she could have run away as soon as it became evident that the leaders of the newborns she was with were dangerous (which she figured out <em>very</em> early on), there would have been no plot to the novella at all. Even if Bree didn't want to risk hiding in shade during the day, she still doesn't think to run away when she does learn that direct sunlight is safe!
</li><li> Come to think of it, how much of the crap everyone in the series goes through could have been avoided if just <em>one person</em> in the entire Cullen family had realized just how badly Edward was coping with being a vampire and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTherapists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTherapists">persuaded him to get some counseling?</a>
</li><li> Let's be honest here, how much of everything that went wrong in the series could have been avoided if Tyler's van ran Bella over in the first place and Edward wasn't there to save her? There would have been no reason to bring down the wrath of the Volturi, no need for the vampire army, and no danger of anybody breaking the treaty and setting off a war between the vampires and shifters.

An inspirational portrait of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleMissBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleMissBadass">child rebel leader</a> has been lost. Things have gone very badly for the good guys ever since. Darger has two generals asking each other how the loss of a picture could be responsible for the situation, expressing impatience with their own author and his obsessive search for the <em>actual</em> portrait he had lost in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> (<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsie_Paroubek">here it is<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>). He had threatened to have the bad guys win in his story if the picture was not returned or replaced.
</li><li> The eponymous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EthanFrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EthanFrome">Ethan Frome</a></em> could have saved <em>everyone</em> a lot of misery and just gotten himself a divorce from Zena.

It is suggested at one point that the One Ring be given to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">Tom Bombadil</a>, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToMindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToMindControl">is completely unaffected by its corruption</a> mostly because he just doesn't care about it despite its great power. Gandalf shoots the suggestion down by pointing out that Tom Bombadil would probably end up losing it <em>because</em> he doesn't care about it.

<ul><li> If Ned Stark had held off confronting Cersei until after he had gathered a force of trustworthy soldiers and made sure his daughters safety was secured, then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he wouldn't have been betrayed and executed, and Sansa and Arya wouldn't have been at his enemies' mercy</span>.
</li><li> Jorah Mormont ruined his life and drove his House into destitution trying to support the affluent lifestyle of his highborn wife. However, it's never explained why he didn't just ask his obscenely rich in-laws for the money needed to keep their daughter happy. Although, the most likely reason was that Jorah is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">so prideful</a> that he would sooner die than ask anyone for help.
</li><li> In the second book, Arya, while being held as a prisoner of war, is rewarded by an assassin she had previously saved with her choice of three deaths. She wastes the first two on cruel soldiers and uses the third to help free some of her brother's high ranking soldiers and start an uprising in the camp. She later realizes that she should have used one of the deaths to kill someone important like Tywin Lannister and cripple the Lannister war effort.
</li><li> Tyrion and Cersei spend much of the second book competing against one another for control over King's Landing. The thing is, Cersei is Queen Regent and is, on paper at least, the highest authority in the country. There's nothing stopping her from just overruling whatever decision Tyrion makes and she could easily strip him of his position and power if she thinks he's undermining her. Conversely, since he knows that one of her significant personality traits is fear of her rightful power being taken away from her, if he had made more of an attempt to keep her in the loop for his plans there would have been a lot less drama during the book, and would probably have caused him less problems down the road. The worst example is when she tries to smuggle her younger son out of the city for safety, Tyrion <em>orders the boy kidnapped</em> simply to take him to another safe haven anyway. Of course, it's made pretty evident that Tyrion is getting off on the rush of power through the book.
</li></ul></li><li> Most of the plots in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall">Redwall</a></em> series could have been avoided had the heroes simply killed the villain(s) of the book or neutralized them before they could begin their campaign of evil, or simply fortified the Abbey and made it impossible for villains to raid.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em>: Season 3 would be much shorter if at any point of time Oliver would just let the League of Assassins deal with the Magician like they wanted to. Considering that the Magician is a villain himself and Oliver <em>himself</em> wanted to kill him at two points of time for <em>the same reasons</em> League hunts him (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Undertaking</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his role in Sara's murder</span>) it makes very little sense that he would want to risk conflict with the League(which helped him in the past) just to protect him. Yes, he has a reason to protect him (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's Thea's father</span>) but this falls flat when you remember that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thea <em>herself</em> rather sensibly disowned him after she learned that he drugged and brainwashed her to kill Sara</span>, making it look like Oliver has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConflictBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConflictBall">Conflict Ball</a> super-glued to his hand. The show tries to justify it with the Magician's claim that the League will punish <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thea</span>, since they're the one who actually fired the arrows, but once Ra's al Ghul makes clear he considers the Magician the real killer, Oliver could have just let the problem resolve itself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilligansIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilligansIsland">Gilligan's Island</a></em>:
<ul><li> The title character is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a>, whose bungling so often sabotaged the rest of the cast's attempts to get back to civilization, that one has to wonder why they simply didn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">eat him</a> — <em>or</em> at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident">arrange for some sort of "accident" to happen to him</a>. Or if they didn't want to be killers, they could've just locked him up until they got off the island (which would likely only take a week), then send someone back for him afterwards. Or they simply could have given Gilligan a less critical role in the plan.
</li><li> Evidence from the show itself actually helps Gilligan's case. <a class="urllink" href="http://captaincomics.ning.com/forum/topics/the-baron-watches-gilligans?id=3370054%3ATopic%3A27071&amp;page=29#comments">Statistically speaking<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, out of 98 episodes, only 37 involved a direct possibility of escaping the island. Of those 37, only 17 potential rescues were foiled as a result of Gilligan's actions. Admittedly, that's still a lot of rescues for one man to screw up, but the series also has a large number of episodes where Gilligan's actions <em>save</em> everybody — from death, enslavement, imprisonment, etc.
</li><li> They did throw a lampshade on this in one escape attempt, in which they'd found gold on the island but the weight limit on the escape craft could only hold so much. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMeThisTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMeThisTime">Gilligan was the only one</a> to actually abide by the limit, with the others attempting to smuggle more along with them than they were allowed, including the Professor.
</li></ul></li><li> Just about any show which features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> as a plot device has the potential to suffer from this trope if the heroes are too stupid to figure out a way to use that device to its full potential.
<ul><li> A stand-off occurs between the Doctor and the Master in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> parody film <em>The Curse of Fatal Death</em>. The Doctor wins the fight by arranging for the architects to have built a trap door under where the Master's feet would have been after the race goes extinct.
</li><li> The <em>Doctor Who</em> series proper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">handwaves</a> this by saying that the Doctor "can't interfere with established events" — which is code for "can't use time travel in any fashion that would make the dilemma of the week too easy to solve" or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail">having the Doctor solve the dilemma in stories taking place</a> in the past would force the writers to have to keep track of a newly established <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a>."
</li><li> The in-universe explanation for this is that the Doctor and other "time aware" species like the Daleks are aware of fixed points in history that cannot be changed. This is usually indicated by their significance in subsequent history books. It seems that the more an event is ingrained into legend, the less power the Doctor has to alter it. Like the <em>Titanic</em> sinking, the volcano which destroyed Pompeii, the mysterious destruction of the first Mars colony, etc. Attempts to push against these boundaries seem fruitless as Fate keeps making them happen anyway, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">their consequences are so ramified</a> that no substitute event could achieve a paradox-free outcome. It is implied that it <em>is</em> possible to beat fate, but only by accepting all the ramifications to the stability of time. Even a Dalek is shown sparing someone's life because it realizes she isn't meant to die yet.
</li><li> Series 6 shows what happens when a "fixed point" is altered irrevocably; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it breaks history. The entire history of Earth is altered so it all takes place at once, and it's <em>always</em> the moment when time broke</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014">The Flash (2014)</a></em>:
<ul><li> Episode "the Flash is born" would've been over in five minutes flat if <em>anyone</em> thought of exploiting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek">Girder's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalWeakness">Logical Weakness</a>. Bad guy in question can turn his skin to metal protecting him from practically anything Flash can throw at him. However, this wouldn't protect him from electricity. Solution: Buy a stun gun or ask local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Gadgeteer Genius</a> for an electric weapon to deal with him. No one from the Team Flash thinks of this.
</li><li> Inverted in "Rogue Time". Barry <em>does</em> have a way to quickly deal with Weather Wizard (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after traveling back in time episode earlier he knows exacly where Weather Wizard is, and can catch him immediately</span>) and he does so, despite being advised otherwise by Dr. Wells. This however ends up <em>massively</em> backfiring causing problems, among others, with recurring villain Captain Cold. The rest of the episode is pretty much cleaning up the after-effects of eating said Gilligan.
</li><li> In "Trajectory" is revealed that Zoom's powers are killing him. No one ever thinks of simply waiting for that to happen. Granted, there's a lot of damage he could do on Earth-2 in that time, so just leaving him be could be catastrophic, but no one seems to even consider the option.
</li><li> In "Versus Zoom", Zoom kidnaps Wally and says he'll only release him if Barry gives him his powers. Zoom actually keeps his promise and leaves Wally free and stays still while they inject him with Barry's powers. No one for a moment even entertained the idea of putting absolutely anything else in that syringe. Poison, a narcotic, acid, etc. Any of those would have actually given them an advantage against him, at the very least for a few minutes. More than enough for them to get the upper hand and capture him.
</li><li> The vast majority of the threats on the show are from villains who for whatever superpowers they might have still have normal human reflexes and reaction times. Instead of just running in and punching out the villains Barry has the tendency to just stand there quipping at villains which gives them the chance to actually use their powers. This is because otherwise Barry could defeat them and have them in chains before they were even capable of registering that he's there much less able to use their power. This is particularly blatant with villains like Captain Cold and Heatwave, who are just perfectly normal humans with some fancy sci-fi guns and who The Flash should be able to take out before they even pull the trigger.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LostInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LostInSpace">Lost in Space</a></em>, Dr. Smith is a sanctimonious coward who constantly gets the whole ship in trouble through his greed. A great many potential future problems could have been solved simply by leaving him to get killed in the mess he's caused for himself.
<ul><li> A later comic continuation by Innovation Comics partially addresses that by the Robinsons and West finally losing their patience with Smith, throwing him in one of the ship's cryo tubes and keeping him there. At least the movie adaptation gave an explanation as to why he wasn't immediately thrown out the airlock after his first treachery, and they <em>did</em> eventually leave him to die after his betraying them yet again.
</li><li> The third season episode "Time Merchant" establishes that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">had Dr. Smith not been aboard the <em>Jupiter 2</em>, it would have been destroyed in space by a collision. Dr. Smith's additional mass changed the ship's trajectory enough to avoid the collision but also threw the Robinsons off course</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain">It seems that Dr. Smith is incompetent all around.</a>
</li><li> In the original pilot (and the first few episodes) Dr. Smith was a scarily competent, utterly ruthless spy and saboteur who sneaks aboard the ship, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">disables (or kills) a guard with his bare hands, reprograms the robot to sabotage the ship</span>, and only stays aboard because he miscalculates the amount of time he has to get off (he may have been set up by his controllers so he wouldn't still be around to answer any embarrassing questions). He was changed into the bumbling, cowardly character we all love to hate because the producers (and Johnathan Harris himself) realized that otherwise, <em>they couldn't possibly justify the rest of the crew <strong>not</strong> getting rid of him somehow</em>. In fact, Irwin Allen originally planned to kill off the character for exactly that reason, but was convinced it would be better to use him as comic relief.
</li></ul></li><li> Alexander Fitzhugh on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LandOfTheGiants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LandOfTheGiants">Land of the Giants</a></em> is basically an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of Dr. Smith  at least in that it's another Irwin Allen show and he fills the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComplainerIsAlwaysWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComplainerIsAlwaysWrong">Complainer Is Always Wrong</a> niche in the cast. Really though, he isn't nearly so hopelessly awful as Smith, and generally proves himself to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowardlyLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowardlyLion">Cowardly Lion</a> who will come through in the end, <em>after</em> spending half the episode loudly proclaiming that he'll do no such thing. And his fast-talking skills are consistently actually <em>useful</em> for the heroes. Which isn't to say that he doesn't make trouble for the others, but he's not a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">Load</a> like Smith.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em>:
<ul><li> Many a fan has wondered why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> never just sends all the monsters at once instead of doing it one at a time, or simply launched an attack themselves if they were so powerful. Immediately, that is, not at the final episode where the heroes get an inexplicable power boost either. Similarly, more than a few seasons had the Rangers know exactly where the villain's base was located, but it never occurred to them to take three or four <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> to the location and stomp on stuff until a final battle was forced.
</li><li> The few times the villains do actually send multiple enemies for the Rangers to fight at once (for example, during the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Green With Evil</a>" story arc which introduced the Green Ranger) the result is usually a decisive victory for the villains. Makes you wonder why they never took the hint and just did that all the time.
</li><li> The monster sending was justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTimeForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTimeForce">Power Rangers Time Force</a></em> as Ransik isn't strong enough to control all the Mutants if he released them all at once, as pointed out by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AtopTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AtopTheFourthWall">Linkara</a>. This reason was also used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MaskedRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MaskedRider">Masked Rider</a></em>.
</li><li> Explained in <em>Shin Kenjushi</em> (<em>New/Heart Gunman</em>) (Née <em>Jushi Sentai</em> [<em>Musketeer Squadron</em>]) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/FranceFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/FranceFive">France Five</a></em>, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody">Affectionate Parody</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a> and French culture. The Eiffel Tower projects a forcefield around planet Earth, meaning that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> can only send small squadrons of troops to Earth at a time, including a monster, some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Panous-panous</a> and his two lieutenants.
</li><li> As per Tony Oliver at Power Morphicon 2007, quoting Haim Saban: "Because if they call 911, then I don't have a TV show." (Presumably Haim was saying that if somebody were to call the police whilst the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> was still small or such, the Power Rangers would have an easy victory).
</li><li> Also makes sense in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM">Power Rangers RPM</a></em>. The city of Corinth is surrounded by a forcefield, meaning that each monster has to have some way to get around that and into the city. Also, finding out where the enemy's base is is a major plot point.
</li><li> Lothor, the lead villain in the delightfully self-aware <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersNinjaStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersNinjaStorm">Power Rangers Ninja Storm</a></em>, actually attempts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMyMonsterGrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMyMonsterGrow">supersize</a> all of his monsters at once, only for the computer to respond with a memory error and his underling pointing out that he skimped on the memory upgrade that would let him supersize more than one monster at a time.
</li><li> Similarly, still in <em>Ninja Storm</em>, "Why don't you just get the Zords from the beginning and stomp the monster?" was discussed (while not done in a way that justifies it for the whole series) when the Rangers were having trouble fighting multiple monsters who managed to break the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjutsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjutsu">Conservation of Ninjutsu</a> (oh, and they <em>actually were ninjas,</em> working for the ninja-based villain faction.) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersOperationOverdrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersOperationOverdrive">Dax</a> suggests sending the Zords even though "we don't normally do this," but they couldn't be launched due to an earlier monster-inflicted computer virus.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">Natsuki</a> uses this <em>exact</em> tactic in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoGoSentaiBoukenger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoGoSentaiBoukenger">Boukenger</a></em>. And it's simultaneously <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKWnVjPZoJ0">horrifying and hilarious<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Except once in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a></em>, but the result wasn't good, because this monster was specifically designed to hijack the Zords. And in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo">Power Rangers Turbo</a></em>, because the monster was sun-powered, and the Rangers decided the only way to defeat him was <em>using the Megazord to <strong>shadow</strong> him</em>.
</li><li> The Zords couldn't be sent "all at once" because the "laws of Good" prevent Good from "escalating" the violence. The bad guys, especially in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a></em> most likely have limits such as the magic taking a heavy toll on the user. In fact Ivan Ooze in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a></em> needed to hypnotize people to build the technology so that he could use it.
</li><li> It's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a></em> comic — one of the team asks why they don't just go straight to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombiningMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombiningMecha">Megazords</a> and squish the villain while he's still small. The response is that Zordon has instructed them to only match force for force against their enemies, due to some pseudo-Eastern mystic from space logic about fair play... of course this means that the enemy will cause <em>more</em> suffering, death, destruction and damage than if they'd fought <em>un</em>fairly...
</li><li> "Why don't villains just blow up the Rangers' houses at night?" has also been dealt with, once again, by <em>Ninja Storm</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> suggests attacking them at the sports shop they work at, but Lothor says that a Ranger's power can only truly be destroyed while the Ranger is morphed. (Mind you, we've seen that prove untrue more than once in the past, but hey, they tried.)
</li><li> This is more clearly explained in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLightspeedRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLightspeedRescue">Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue</a></em> <strong>and</strong> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai">Power Rangers Samurai</a></em>. In <em>Lightspeed Rescue</em> the demons locate the base, but since it's underwater they can't destroy it as water is their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor">kryptonite</a>. In Samurai, it's explained that a shield protects it from monster attacks.
</li></ul></li><li> Of course, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em> usually avoids this trope by not using the same "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> sends a minion to defeat the hero each week" format as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a>, but there are exceptions. More recent series (notably <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDenO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDenO">Den-O</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKiva" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKiva">Kiva</a></em>) have the villains start using mass produced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">MotWs</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>, but by that point Wataru's gotten his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> and they're no challenge (as seen when Kiva takes out six with a single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Finishing Move</a>). Meanwhile, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDouble">Kamen Rider Double</a>,</em> the villains of the week don't actually work for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, whose plan just requires <em>observing</em> the thugs he's sold powers to, and he is perfectly happy to have Kamen Riders fighting them and getting them to show their true strength.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderWizard">Kamen Rider Wizard</a></em> has one particularly egregious case. Nitou/Kamen Rider Beast is powered by a Chimera who requires mana to survive lest he consume his host; he gets this by consuming defeated Phantoms. One of the Phantoms and major villains of the series, Phoenix, has the ability to be reborn every time he dies. So naturally, Beast devouring Phoenix would have resolved two problems at once: how to keep Chimera from not devour Nitou AND how to ensure Phoenix wouldn't come back.
</li><li> If the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">Guild of Calamitous Intent</a> has taught us anything it's that provoking massively powerful superbeings with private armies is a bad idea. The good guys are five teenagers who are invariably placed against nigh-impossible odds. Escalating the war would cause the villain to actually get off their duff and start actively trying to destroy shit. Sure a few buildings are destroyed along the way but it's better than the alternative.
</li><li> In another terrible <em>Power Rangers</em> rip-off, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TattooedTeenageAlienFightersFromBeverlyHills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TattooedTeenageAlienFightersFromBeverlyHills">Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters from Beverly Hills</a></em>, the bumbling sidekick of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> gets a chance to be in charge while the villain is away, and implements an ingenious tactic of sending down a monster, recalling it when it was close to death, and sending a new one, repeated until the heroes were worn down and defeated. On the verge of success, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> returns from his trip and proves that he had a firm grip on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall">Villain Ball</a> by demanding that things be returned to the proven-to-fail "one monster each week" strategy.
</li><li> Almost invariably in the early seasons, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> would be trashing the Power Rangers, and Rita would declare, "If you think you're having it rough now, wait until you see this!" before making the monster <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMyMonsterGrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMyMonsterGrow">grow to a preposterous size</a>. At this point the <em>Power Rangers</em> would use their cool toys and destroy the monster, every single time. If only Rita had left the monster at its original size, she could have won easily. For that matter, why didn't the Power Rangers just use their giant mechas on the "human-sized" monster? Another thing: every villain in <em>Power Rangers</em> ever has had the ability to teleport at will, anywhere, through walls, and even bring along passengers or cargo. Picture the cataclysmic implications if they were to use this power intelligently. In the Alien Rangers arc of MMPR, Goldar and Rito did <em>just that,</em> only with a bomb of the usual villains' making.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Beetleborgs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Beetleborgs">Beetleborgs</a></em>, a new villain waited until the heroes' base rose out of the ground and then having the monster-planes bomb it while the vehicles were still inside. Though the heroes eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">got new, cooler, vehicles</a>, it was a devastating blow. It also made you wonder why absolutely no-one's ever thought of that before. Which is really strange, because in the rest of the many-parts episode, this monster didn't use savviness. On the contrary, at this point he destroyed all the other weapons playing by the rules, just to show he could do it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DegrassiTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DegrassiTheNextGeneration">Degrassi: The Next Generation</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the third, fourth, and fifth seasons, more than half of the plots could have been resolved in ten seconds if the characters had chosen not to associate with Jay Hogart. He started off with a bad reputation, yet nobody even gives a second thought above how "cool" they'd look being his friend. What did his victims do when they finally realized he was manipulating them? They glared at him really angrily, and sometimes even spoke harsh words. Some of these kids have beaten each other up because of his tricks, but when they find out the brawl was his fault, they don't even throw a punch at him. However, he does become a semi-helpful member of the cast in the sixth and seventh seasons. He still manages to do the wrong things on several occasions there as well.
</li><li> You'd think after Jay <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was expelled for being one of the leading causes of the school shooting</span> that people would stop hanging around him, but Alex, Amy, Emma and J.T. still thought he was cool, and just look at what happened to all of them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em>: For a series entirely about being stranded in space, the cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenPhlebotinum">Forgotten Phlebotinum</a> are face-palming in their regularity. There are numerous occasions where the crew have some means of space or time travel which, fair enough, go wrong during the episode, but are never re-used or <em>even brought up again</em>. These include: the ability to enter any photograph and live there within the confines of the frame; a device allowing them to travel to different dimensions; and a teleporter (with somewhat limited range). Combining one or two of these methods could have easily gotten them back to Earth, or anywhere else they wanted to go. However, the most glaring case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> grabbing has to be in the episode "Tikka to Ride", where the crew have a fully functioning time drive which allows them to travel <em>anywhere in the Universe, at any time period</em>. Lister's plan to use this device? To go to a curry house, <em>on Earth, during his own time period</em> and order a stock of takeaways which they would then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot">bring back to the ship with them</a>. And even though this plan goes awry, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverRecycleYourSchemes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverRecycleYourSchemes">never try again</a>.
<ul><li> In the Back To Earth movie, this is lampshaded as just about every easy way of traveling is brought up, only for the main cast to explain that they left everything back on the ship. Apparently when the ship is literally miles long it's easy for the crew to misplace things.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>. If the crew had simply tossed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">Lawful Stupid</a> Captain Janeway out the airlock after her silly Starfleet rules prevented them from getting home the first time, they'd have gotten home by the next week. At one stage Q hints that <em>Voyager</em> would get back home a lot quicker if Janeway "mated" with him. The Captain certainly can't be blamed for refusing to use her body as a bargaining chip, but in later episodes so much emphasis was placed on how much she is willing to sacrifice to get her crew home, fans couldn't help wondering why she didn't just sleep with him when she had the chance.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebSite/SFDebris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebSite/SFDebris">SF Debris</a> (who, ironically enough, is a vocal critic of the Janeway character) neatly solved this conundrum by pointing out that it wasn't <em>just</em> sex, it was having a child. This is fundamentally life-altering and adds many more factors to the decision. Besides, this is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral">Chaotic Neutral</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeing">Energy Being</a> who is "worshiped" as <em>the God of Lies</em> on at least one planet; it's doubtful at best that he'd keep his end of the bargain.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebSite/SFDebris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebSite/SFDebris">SF Debris</a> also (falsely) noted that judicious use of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeBomb">Time Bomb</a> in the pilot would have turned the series into little more than a TV movie. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">Sadistic Choice</a> at the end of "Caretaker" was, should <em>Voyager</em> destroy the Caretaker Array and leave themselves with hoofing it home, or use the Array to get home and let the Kazon enslave the Ocampas? Janeway chose to blow the Array. Chuck Sonnenburg's solution was to set a time bomb aboard the Array, set to go off just after it chucked <em>Voyager</em> back to the Alpha Quadrant. Unfortunately, there was an easily-missed line where Tuvok notes that without the Caretaker, it would take several hours to activate the Array and that's assuming that it doesn't get even <em>more</em> damaged in a multi-hour firefight. And assuming that they can use it without tearing themselves apart in the process, as almost happens when they're pulled into the Delta Quadrant. It's understandable, since even the <em>writers</em> seemed to forget that bit of information.</span>
</li><li> Since it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">diplomatic option</a> bears consideration. Janeway could have tried negotiating a deal with the Kazon (whether or not it would have worked is another matter). Don't shoot, and let Voyager use the Array to get home. The Kazon have waited long enough, so a few extra hours while taking notes over Janeway's shoulder would have been an acceptable trade for her not destroying their prize.
</li><li> Of course, the possibly best solution would have been to simply stall for time for <em>Voyager</em> to return home as noted above, only for the Kazon to discover that Janeway had left them a little housewarming gift when they finally board the array, in the form of tri-cobalt devices <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeBomb">rigged to explode on a timer</a>. A morally questionable act worthy of Kirk's era, but one that would ultimately have been for the greater good of both her crew, the Ocampa and the Delta Quadrant.
</li><li> For more information on Janeway's questionable actions and possible justifications, check out Trek Nation's <a class="urllink" href="http://www.treknation.com/articles/court_martial_janeway_intro.shtml">The Court Martial of Captain Janeway<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Then there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TheScrappy/LiveActionTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TheScrappy/LiveActionTV">Neelix</a>. Like Doctor Smith of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LostInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LostInSpace">Lost in Space</a></em>, Neelix originally was a competent character. He owned and operated a single-ship, knew the territory, was just ruthless enough to survive, and made his living as a grifter, a pirate, and a salvager. A few episodes later and suddenly he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">useless, obnoxious, egocentric buffoon</a> with the intellect and emotional capacity of a toddler. At his worst, he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone">gotten several crew members killed and endangered the entire ship</a> on multiple occasions. In one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episode</a>, he went beyond reckless endangerment and committed <em>bona fide</em>, premeditated treason. Not only does he never earn anything worse than a stern reprimand for the multiple fatalities he causes, he actually gets <em>put in charge of people</em>. Despite not being an officer, or even a member of Starfleet, nor having any noteworthy abilities beyond the sheer gall to appoint himself "morale officer". To top it off <em>while he is in charge</em> his leadership is directly the cause of one death while marooned on an alien planet. All because he has no concept of the buddy system. The bastard child of Spock and Marvin the Paranoid Android would be better for morale than Neelix.
</li><li> He's not just put in charge of morale, but also of <em>cooking</em>, of all things. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef">food is so awful</a> that in one episode he actually <em>poisons</em> the ship with his cooking fumes. Not the ship's crew, but the <em>actual ship itself.</em> While it's possible he's a competent chef by Talaxian standards (but that is really stretching), he rarely bothers adapting to the fact that the rest of the crew are non-Talaxians. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.stardestroyer.net/mrwong/wiki/index.php/Plastic_Chef_Neelix">There is at least one wiki page documenting his failures.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The justification for this seems to be that as a native of that region of space, he knows what food is edible and what isn't (this is pointed out at least once in the early episodes). Why he isn't just assigned as hunter-gatherer and someone else put in charge of cooking, however, is another question.
</li><li> In <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sfdebris.com/voyager/e835.asp">"Investigations"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Neelix conducts a rogue investigation, makes an accusation using weak evidence, and violates the privacy of fellow crew members.
</li><li> A <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMHzOjggHoA">youtube<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> clip on how Neelix should have been handled in the series.
</li><li> On the other hand, B'Elanna Torres hates her own appearance (she is half Klingon), a problem that she has apparently had since she was a little girl. It is never explained why she could not have plastic surgery or a genetic treatment in the very medically advanced 24th century. In the same series, Seska was a Cardassian but was surgically disguised as a Bajoran (an alien species almost identical to humans). So if a treatment is available that can turn a Cardassian into a Bajoran (or human for that matter), why did Torres never bother to change her Klingon forehead — something that could probably have been done easily at any point of her life?
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment">Arrested Development</a></em>:
<ul><li> GOB routinely screws up Michael's plans to save the company, week after week after week, even to the point of undoing what good Michael has achieved. Given how often this occurs, it is surprising that Michael always has a change of heart right after he decides to finally get rid of GOB for good. Indeed, the humor of the series mainly stems from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardTruthAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardTruthAesop">Hard Truth Aesop</a> that Michael should stop caring about his family, but he is unable to.
</li><li> If only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Michael</a> had moved away from his incompetent, irresponsible and immoral family, he wouldn't have to deal with their shenanigans. To his credit, he did try to leave in the beginning of season two. But the SEC was extra suspicious at that point.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Fox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Fox">Fox</a> run of the show actually ends with the SEC coming after the Bluths again and Michael finally going, "Y'know what? <em>Fuck this.</em>" One of the first things in the order of business of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a> season was getting Michael back into his family's life.
</li><li> On the other hand, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Michael can be just as bad and self-centered as the rest of the Bluths</a> and one of the reasons why he hangs around is because he genuinely gets off on his own feeling of self-importance and needing to be relied on by the rest of the family. Him leaving the family to fend for themsleves in order to spend time with his son he previously spent the entire series neglecting is arguably positive character development in the context.
</li></ul></li><li> Played hilariously straight twice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinHood">Robin Hood</a></em> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple">the obligatory female</a> Kate, though both times it happened without the writers noticing what they'd done. That this girl is a liability to the team is undeniable; she's constantly getting kidnapped, injured and sabotaging outlaw plans thanks to her <strike>reckless</strike> stupid behaviour. Therefore, it's rather amusing in the episode "Too Hot to Handle" that Kate is kidnapped (again) while the outlaws are en route to the River Trent. Instead of organising a rescue, they just continue on their way without any attempt made to go after her. Later in "Something Worth Fighting For" she marches off in a huff after being tricked into believing that Robin is cheating on her. Despite the amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">shilling</a> that goes on, nobody seems to care about or even really notice her absence — though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">luckily she arrives back</a> just in time to completely ruin their successful attempt at a peaceful sit-in protest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> thrived on this, which is not surprising considering the connections to <em>Gilligan's Island</em>.
<ul><li> All the survivors of 815 had to do was to <em>hold a big meeting and compare notes about this VERY odd island</em> to keep their cool and work more as a cohesive group. This is what the survivors tried to do initially. Except there were people trying to act in the best interests of the group, such as Sayid and co. keeping the French transmission a secret. And then people acting in their own interests, like Kate trying to keep her past a secret or Sawyer making everyone hate him because he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie">Jerkass Woobie</a>. And then there's Locke, who... is Locke. Arguably, part of the show's point is that when left to their own devices, people are prone to conflict and self-destruction.

</div></li><li> Part of the show's point is also that people only come to work together when all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends">threatened by the same thing</a> (Smokey, Others, No-Food/Water/Meds, wtf) but when they ain't, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDissonance">''every man for himself''</a>.
</li><li> As a specific example, you could rename this trope to Just Eat Ben and it would still work. This man who has frankly random people kidnapped and murdered at his own whim, manipulates the protagonists continually, and is a flat-out bastard with only a <em>few</em> sympathetic traits (which he is quick to exploit for his own means) is constantly put into scenarios where the protagonists can kill him... and they don't. Every time this happens, it bites them in the ass later.
</li><li> By season six they do stop going along with any plan of Ben's. Anyone who was ever thinking 'Stop listening to Ben!' had to laugh when Sun knocked him unconscious and stole the boat he had led her to, and the last season continued in that vein, with all other characters completely ignoring anything Ben said or wanted to do.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em> gave Rygel a great many opportunities to prove himself a life-endangering nuisance in the first season: at one point, trying to fool a gang of mercenaries into believing that he still holds a position of authority, he "borrows" a critical part of Moya's circuitry to decorate his sceptre- and almost gets the entire crew killed when the mercenaries kidnap him, sceptre and all. And after almost erasing Moya's data banks in an attempt to get home, releasing a virus on the crew, he eventually goes on to sell out his shipmates to Scorpius... only for the crew to begrudgingly accept his return when the attempted betrayal goes sour. Even the second season took a while to actually transform him into a useful character, revealing that they kept him around solely because while a useless, greedy, selfish idiot under normal circumstances, put him in a situation where intrigue and/or bartering are necessary and he suddenly turns into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad">Prince Kheldar</a>, which is quite handy when your budget closely resembles a shoestring.
</li><li> For some reason, the characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KeepingUpAppearances" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KeepingUpAppearances">Keeping Up Appearances</a></em> never just <em>refuse</em> to do whatever Hyacinth says. When Hyacinth ignores a "No", the characters appear resigned to obey her. It gets turned into a running gag when Emmet tries to coach Liz into refusing coffee with Hyacinthe. She's <em>just. that.</em> SCARY.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008">Merlin</a></em>:
<ul><li> You could make a case for it, but the title character's steadfast refusal to tell <em>anyone</em> about the fact that he has magic has caused more problems than it has solved. In particular, his treatment of Morgana led at least partially to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>. Particularly as she likewise discovers she has magic in the second series. Her neck is on the line just as much as his, as it doesn't seem like that Uther would have been merciful.
</li><li> As of Series 5, this has turned into "just kill Morgana". Sure, he can't track her down, but he has so many opportunities to just snap her neck with magic and yet he doesn't. Why? Just... why? She's way beyond redemption by now, and is probably too insane to even be bargained with. And yet in "Another's Sorrow", he doesn't even kill her when she's strangling him, even though his life is in danger and it would be painfully easy for him to explode her head. You could say that he still feels sorry for her, but he doesn't seem to have any problem with attempting to kill Mordred, who is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain">Designated Villain</a>. Killing Morgana might actually be explained in the finale as it's established there (and no earlier), that Morgana is really hard to kill.
</li><li> Merlin is screwed either way. No matter if he decides to ignore fate and help Morgana or Mordred or if he tries to avoid it and by killing either one of them, the result is always the worst possible outcome. The real useless character is the dragon, because Merlin fares way better whenever he makes his decisions without being influenced by him or any other kind of prophecy. As soon as he knows what will come, he is doomed.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Revenge">Revenge</a></em> revolves around Emily Thorne's quest to take down the Grayson family and exonerate her framed father. This is something she easily could have accomplished in the first season as Emily effortlessly bugs Grayson manor and quickly collects a dossier of incriminating video evidence. But instead of simply turning this over to the police or public, Emily throws the laptop full of evidence into the ocean claiming that it was a "distraction". She then proceeds to execute an elaborate 3-year-long plan where she seduces Daniel Grayson, marries into his family and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">attempts to frame Victoria for her faked murder</span>. Over the course of this plan she loses <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her best friend, her lover's brother, her fiance and her ability to bear children, all at the hands of the Graysons. Her eventual takedown of the Graysons only takes one episode and involves a fairly simple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredPublicConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredPublicConfession">Engineered Public Confession</a>,</span> raising the question of why she didn't just do this to begin with.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>, after Daenerys conquers the cities of Slavers Bay and frees the slaves, an elderly freedman asks her to let him voluntarily sell himself back to his old master, since he was well treated in the household as a tutor to his masters children, and his life as a homeless unemployed freedman is materially worse then his life as a slave. He also states that there are many former slaves who feel the same way he does. This is intended to show that a charismatic leader cannot resolve structural societal ills overnight, that there are no easy solutions to complex problems, and that Danys idealism and good intentions may need to be compromised to keep society running smoothly. The idea that the man and people like him could simply work for pay with some legal protections, particularly the right to change jobs if they want, is never considered or even mentioned.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible">Mission: Impossible</a></em> actually has this inverted. Whenever there seems to be an easier, alternate way to accomplish the goal for the episode, one of the characters will bring it up in the pre-mission briefing and then an explanation as to why that can't work is given. (In "Trial By Fury," where the mission is to re-establish a convict's good name in a prison so he can continue to serve as liaison for another prisoner who's the face of his country's democracy movement, Barney asks why they can't just free them both; Phelps replies that they both know they're of far more value where they are.) In fact, the standing reason why the Impossible Mission Force can't just assassinate targets (which is obviously much easier than the convoluted schemes on the show) is because of a "policy decision" on behalf of the higher-ups in the United States.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DennisTheMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DennisTheMenace">Dennis the Menace</a></em>. Mr. Wilson's life would be much better if the Mitchells would move away. The worst part is that the man knows this, and his warnings to the other characters are tragically ignored. An episode of the animated series dealt with this. Dennis breaks Mr. Wilson's window and he boards it up, and tells Dennis to just <em>pretend</em> that he has moved away from now on, in an attempt to get some peace. A pair of movers show up, having gotten lost while on their way to move an entire house, and ask Dennis if he knows anyone who is moving. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded">Dennis points them toward Mr. Wilson's house</a>, and they take the boarded up window as a sign that he is right. They lift the entire home onto a truck and take it away, with Mr. Wilson trying desperately to stop them. Eventually his house ends up in a nice coastal area, and he realizes that not only is his new location better, but <em>no Dennis</em>. But the movers figure out their mistake and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">take the house back over his protests</a>.

Rip Hunters entire arc in the first season is wanting to save his family by preventing Vandal Savages rise to power, and later moving on. Its never explained why he cant just resurrect them by taking the Waverider back to pick them up before Savage killed them (presumably at a point where Past!Rip wasnt with them). And when Laurel dies in Arrow, Rip explains that he deliberately dropped them off after the events of season 4 of Arrow because if Sarah was with Laurel at the time, she, Laurel, and their father would all be fated to die (and presumably taking Laurel with them wasnt an option). But because there was a significant interval between Laurel being mortally wounded and dying, and the Waverider is established to have advanced medical technolgy, why not pick Laurel up and heal her right after shes been stabbed and Darkh has left? Strangely, this is exactly what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Prometheus</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Black Siren</a> trick Team Arrow into thinking happened at the beginning of Arrows 5th season.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor">Survivor</a></em>, several seasons had people shouting, "Just vote out <em>x</em>!" at their TVs. Especially recent seasons, wherein players seemed to have become afraid to rock the boat and try taking control of their alliances and vote out the designated "leader".
<ul><li> <em>All-Stars</em>: By the time that Chaboga Mogo realizes that Rob and Amber have no intention of bringing them to the final Tribal Council, they're down to four people and Rob is still carrying the Immunity Necklace. This comes after Rob has repeatedly told the other members of the group that he won't break his alliance/relationship with Amber for any reason. This later leads to a series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"Reason You Suck" speeches</a> at the final Tribal Council ... which rings hollow once the contestants realized that Rob proposed to her and that the engaged couple would win either way.
</li><li> <em>Redemption Island</em> would have had a <em>very</em> different outcome if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Ometepes</a> realized Rob was too dangerous to be allowed to run the game. Especially jarring considering the very first tribal council, Kristina reveals she has the idol meaning that Rob doesn't, and has a <em>very</em> big sign reading, "Vote me out" on his face. Unsurprisingly, he wound up winning.
</li><li> <em>South Pacific</em>. Did it simply never occur to the Savaiis that they probably should have voted out Cochran? Especially after all they did to him?
</li><li> <em>One World</em>. Viewers very quickly began to expect that everyone would just let Colton walk all over everybody. He did- until he was medevaced.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>:
<ul><li> Season Four has a particularly annoying example. Xander hands Buffy a flare gun, and she replies "We're fighting vampires, not signaling ships at sea". The characters haven't had a problem with using flaming arrows to great effect on vampires, so why wouldn't a flare gun be just as effective? She uses it later which obscures the vision of her enemies, but seriously, a flare gun would be a great weapon against any vampire. A big incendiary projectile.
</li><li> Season Five established a) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Glory</a> can't leave this dimension without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">The Key</a>. b) The key has been incarnated as Dawn, written into the timeline as Buffy's sister, c) Glory is much stronger that Buffy, and will stop at nothing to get The Key, d) Willow has the ability to send living beings to other dimensions (though admittedly her ability to choose a specific dimension is in question), and e) Buffy knows she can't take Glory head-on, so she chooses to take Dawn and run, presumably for the rest of their lives. The idea that Willow could have just sent Dawn (and probably Buffy in order to protect her) to another dimension and thus trap Glory here forever is never brought up. Glory has to do her thing in Sunnydale, on a specific date, after which (as far as we can tell) the Key is useless. So why not ship Dawn off to France for a few months? There's no indication that Glory can track her.
</li><li> Season Seven would have had far less complications ensue in the second half of the season had the main characters invented some kind of mandatory "touch" system where they would have to make regular physical contact with each other to see if everyone present was corporeal. The First Evil caused so many problems by imitating other characters (but is incorporeal) that it seems odd that no system is invented to regularly verify that everyone there is really who they say they are. In their defense, The First didn't actually trick them this way all that many times. It could only imitate dead people, so besides Buffy and Spike, it could only trick people with a form that had died recently without anyone knowing about it. Most of the time the people it was talking to were well aware it wasn't their dead friend they were talking to, but the First just used the forms to mess with their heads.
</li><li> For a villainous example, why there aren't more villains that simply find out where Buffy lives and dealing with her there. This is lampshaded in Season Six when the villain Warren simply gives her address to a monster to deal with her, and later visits her house and shoots her there. Probably the most problematic is in Season Seven, when the First Evil's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">minion Caleb</a> has killed all of the Watcher's Council using a bomb, later kills MORE Slayer Potentials using a different bomb, simply never bombs Buffy's house where she and all of her army are living.
</li><li> Slayers rarely ever use fire when hunting vampires, despite it proving one of their greatest weaknesses, even to the oldest and strongest vampires? Particularly noticable with the introduction of the Turok-Han, the uber-vampires from Season Seven who prove more resistant to stakes and holy water, are not affected by crosses and do not need invitations to enter homes. Yet at no point does anyone suggest the possibility of testing their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">resistance to fire?</a>
</li><li> In Season 9, Andrew had set up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> to deal with Simone: it involved creating another Buffybot, getting the real Buffy stoned, putting Buffy's mind in the bot (and making her think she's pregnant), then setting up the real Buffy with the bot's brain to think it lives a different life in a suburban home Andrew had set up, so when the assassin strikes, bot!Buffy might be ready for it, maybe, possibly. Andrew being Andrew, he was being far too clever for his own good; a much simpler solution would have been to use the bot to lure out Simone.

The simple solution would've been to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">write off</a> (or more cathartically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">kill off</a>) Cameron's character or replace the actor with a less religiously zealous one. But that thought apparently never occurred to anyone when other cast members were kicked off because Cameron thought they were too "sinful". Well, as the Cracked article states: Cameron was the teenage heartthrob whose face was on the cover of <em>Tiger Beat</em>. Kirk Cameron made ABC money.

He participates in the CIA strike team raid, helping them poison <em>everyone</em>, which leads to two more sailors' deaths. He then straps a bomb vest to another sailor, which King barely defuses, then halfheartedly offers up a scapegoat. Then he starts selling drugs to the sailors, and tortures the COB when he tries to intervene. It would be justified if the islanders loved him, but they don't, they know he's an exploitative thug. It could also be justified if he was well-protected, but he isn't; King and another SEAL sneak right into his living room without difficulty.

<ul><li> Practically every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon">Mon</a> game along with their supplementary material would qualify for this. Why the villains keep deciding to pick a fight with the humans' powerful partners every single time instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightForTheCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightForTheCommander">just going after the squishy human nearby who almost never takes cover</a> is a mystery for the ages. There are even some cases in where the ratings system and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">Plot Armor</a> are the only reason why the human heroes are still alive, especially whenever the humans are separated from their mons.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> franchise has been on-and-off about all this. Sure, its kid-friendly status prevents the player trainer from being outright murdered on-screen (Ardos' plan to blow up Citadark Isle is rejected by Greevil, while N stops Ghetsis from freezing them), but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXDGaleOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXDGaleOfDarkness">Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</a></em> is the only instance in the games where the player trainer is directly attacked with no interruption (in this case, Wakin puts Michael to sleep and jacks the Snag Machine while he's out cold). Which begs the question of why TPC doesn't push further into Pokemon-on-trainer violence more often...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">It's been said</a> that the quickest way to "win" <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em> is to obtain the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon">Plot Coupon</a> and then turn the game off. If a villain needs three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffins</a> to make their evil plan work and the hero has obtained one, there's usually no real reason to go after the others and every reason not to (granted, if Link isn't doing <em>anything</em>, Ganondorf can easily kill him and take the stone. That's not to mention the whole "destiny" thing). In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> states that in the "Child" Timeline (the one Link is sent back to at the end of <em>Ocarina</em>), this is exactly how Zelda and Link keep Ganondorf from invading the Sacred Realm.
</li><li> Villainous example: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork">Mega Man Battle Network</a></em>, it takes the villains until the second-to-last non-postgame cut scene in the series to realize that three adults taking on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero">Kid Hero</a> Lan in real life is a better idea than taking on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowyInvincibleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowyInvincibleHero">MegaMan</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyberspace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyberspace">cyberspace</a>. Only BubbleMan uses a dangerous machine with no access ports. This prevents anyone from getting their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon">Navis</a> in and hacking the machine to stop. BubbleMan's plan failed because defeating him also shuts down the machines. But the clear point remains, the ONLY way the majority of the cast can combat the bad guys is by sending Navis into their machines, so if the villains just used machines with no access ports, or used more real world obstacles, the heroes would be powerless to stop them. Lan isn't even armed, defeating him in person is literally as easy as walking over and subduing a school kid.
<ul><li> Even the heroic characters are kind of stupid. The crowning achievement is the third game. The plot revolves around the bad guys trying to obtain an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> computer virus that was sealed away by four keys.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em>, why the hell didn't the good guys actively try to get their hands on Takaya and Strega in general? During the dark hour they have their personas and the ability to locate stuff during the day, by, uh, involving the police? The Kirijo Group manages to make a policeman sell friggin' weapons to teenagers (including firearms), and they have their own crewmen who could look for them, maybe even helped by Aigis who with or without persona would certainly be able to overpower the thin, sickly, looking Takaya, gun or no gun.

<ul><li> If RED stopped building railway tracks leading from their base to the BLU base, it would be harder to blow up their base. Their reasoning is that they want to send a cart of their own to blow up the BLU base. Further parodied in the "Mann vs. Machine" update, where waves of robots are able to blow up Mann Co.'s bases due to giant bomb holes in the ground. The update comics say they're rethinking that particular policy.

Most of them give you some helpful advice, sure, but why don't any of them help you fight Gnasty? Because the dragons you rescue in Gnasty's World are dragons you freed previously, there is an implication that if the dragons helped fight him, they'd just be encased in crystal again, but nothing is outright stated. The sequels at least give reasons for it, e.g. in <em>Gateway to Glimmer/Ripto's Rage</em>, Spyro's the only dragon available to stop Ripto's takeover of Avalar, since there's no actual portals to the Dragon Realm. In <em>Year of the Dragon</em>, he's the only dragon who can fit through the small hole left by the intruders after they stole the dragon eggs.

After the message is done, Prince Peasly proposes to use a fake replica of the Beanstar to give to the baddies to trick them without giving up the real deal. Mario and Luigi could've left the real Beanstar at Beanbean Castle for safekeeping, where it belongs, and take only the fake one in the event the villains see through the trick. But they bring both the fake Beanstar and the real Beanstar to Joke's End. Unfortunately, Fawful sees through the trick and knocks out Luigi when he shows the fake Beanstar, and steals the real one from him. Mario then ends up having to resort to dressing Luigi in drag as Peach to trick Bowletta into believing Princess Peach herself was an imposter while Luigi himself is kidnapped in her place.

According to the former employee leaving you voice mail messages, the killer animatrons in the game will attack you because they don't know what humans are - they think you're an animatronic endoskeleton without your costume, and will try to force a costume onto you, killing you in the process. At one point he suggests the obvious answer of playing dead, so they think you're an empty costume instead. He quickly thinks better of it, saying that if they think you're an empty costume they'll try to shove a metal endoskeleton inside you, which would be even worse.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note21554');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note21554" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note21554');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> However despite his reservations, playing dead by holding completely still when your power goes out will sometimes buy you some precious extra seconds to hit the 6AM deadline, it just won't work for very long.</span>

</li><li> For that matter, though, if the animatrons are trying to get you because they think you're an endoskeleton without your costume, why not just make a fake costume (or at least a mask) and wear it to trick them?

</li><li> Many, <em>many</em> video-game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Creepypasta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Creepypasta">creepypastas</a>, such as <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/SonicExe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/SonicExe">Sonic Exe</a></em>, have the protagonist continue playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMostDangerousVideoGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMostDangerousVideoGame">The Most Dangerous Video Game</a> even after they realize it's haunted. However, nothing is preventing them from stopping, meaning that the player could simply turn the game off and get rid of it.

However, nothing prevents them from turning the TV off and then getting rid of the tape/DVD.
<ul><li> In particular, "Blue's Clues - No Clues" is one big example. The tape's haunted, it won't eject from the VCR, and it even managed to magically cut the telephone lines.

It never occurs to him to simply order some food.
<ul><li> Creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckJones">Chuck Jones</a> liked to quote George Santayana's observation, "A fanatic is one who redoubles his effort when he has forgotten his aim." Meaning, to Wile E., eating the Road Runner is largely not the point anymore. Indeed, as Cliff Claven pointed out on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers">Cheers</a></em>, "What he wants is to eat that <em>particular</em> Roadrunner. Very existential."
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightCourt">Night Court</a></em> of all places, with Judge Stone presiding over Wile E. Coyote and telling him that next time he's hungry he should just go to a restaurant or supermarket.
</li><li> In the shorts where Wile E. is pitted against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny">Bugs Bunny</a>, it's made clear that he's in it for the intellectual challenge as much as for a meal. One would assume this is probably the case in the Road Runner shorts as well. Not to mention that, due to his being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3jofg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3jofg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3jofg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He's even got it on business cards</span>, being unable to capture a bird would be a blow to his pride, so he refuses to give up.
</li><li> Lampshaded in one of his shorts. Wile E. explains that the reason he compulsively chases the roadrunner is because roadrunners are the most friggin' delicious things on Earth, including a meat chart with all the flavors of a roadrunner's various cuts laid out.
</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> comic book does actually establish that Wile E. gets his food via mail order, and that catching Roadrunner is just his hobby.
</li><li> This is hilariously lampshaded in a short in which Wile E. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamRocketWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamRocketWins">is successful in his attempts to capture the Roadrunner.</a> Of course, he's now a comically puny size thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a> so the Roadrunner is much...<strong>much</strong> bigger than him. Wile E. then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall">points out to the audience</a> that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoWhatDoWeDoNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoWhatDoWeDoNow">absolutely clueless as to what to do next.</a>
</li><li> There's at least one other short where he catches the Roadrunner, in a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> to people who over-think cartoons. Two chubby bespectacled kids speaking in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SesquipedalianLoquaciousness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SesquipedalianLoquaciousness">big words</a> watching the cartoon note that with his greater intellect, the Coyote should succeed, and explain exactly how in a very simple plan — and the Coyote is listening, and then catches the Roadrunner! He's then informed by the director that he's now fired, as there can't be any more show. He surreptitiously lets the Roadrunner go, and says, "Oh, no, he's escaped!", and is hired again on the spot. The kids are then seen again, saying, "Oh, THAT'S why he never catches the Roadrunner."
</li><li> The heights of Wile E.'s obsession is underscored by the large number of his plans that, had they succeeded, would have <em>destroyed</em> the Road Runner, or at least rendered its carcass inedible.
</li><li> Really one of his main problems is that he keeps buying shoddy products from ACME. Which one episode reveals as being <em>owned and operated</em> by the Road Runner!

However, they don't actually reveal who the villain is until after they're unmasked. This means that they could avoid doing an episode's worth of detective work and just build the trap at the episode's beginning to catch the villain. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatsNewScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatsNewScoobyDoo">What's New, Scooby-Doo?</a></em> they try this for the exact stated reason, and it works! The villain is locked in a jail cell to wait for the police. Then the villain attacks <em>again,</em> and when they check again he's right back in his cell ... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because, of course, the mastermind was actually a set of twins and they only caught one.</span> This does not, of course, explain why they never try it again.
</li><li> Over the course of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats1985" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats1985">ThunderCats (1985)</a></em> Mumm-Ra was revealed to have an incredible array of powers and resources at his disposal.

Possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> by the risk of over-using powers and rendering himself weakened and easily defeated in the next episode. Also, he's ever-living. If he had been willing to just wait the ThunderCats out, they would have gone extinct in a generation (there's nowhere near enough for a breeding population). Any progress they could have made in freeing the world from his tyranny could easily be undone afterward.
</li><li> Speaking of <em>ThunderCats</em>, every animation where we see heroes wielding swords, guns or every obviously dangerous weapons, shows which also include <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse1983">He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (1983)</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987)</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GIJoeARealAmericanHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GIJoeARealAmericanHero">G.I.

At a guess, Bluto hates spinach even more than he hates Popeye, underscored by one cartoon where Bluto invents a powerful herbicide to destroy all of the world's spinach to incapacitate Popeye. Popeye pleads to the audience, and some kid with a grocery bag throws it into the screen. Popeye beats Bluto, and cures all the spinach. The movie at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">HandWaves</a> this by implying that it was not that spinach itself had magical power-up properties, but that Popeye's family had long drawn strength from a diet of spinach.
<ul><li> Bluto DOES eat the spinach willingly in an attempt to beat Popeye at baseball in "The Twisker Pitcher".
</li></ul></li><li> Entire episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin">TaleSpin</a></em> are often driven by Baloo's incompetence, laziness or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">audacity</a>, or Rebecca's hardheadedness, blind ambition or naivete. One wonders why Rebecca just doesn't let Baloo run the company instead of her.
<ul><li> What could be solved simply with some logical thinking often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes">snowballs</a> into a very big problem. Sometimes Kit or Molly's recklessness or need for adventure complicates matters, too, though not as often as Baloo and Rebecca's character flaws do.
</li><li> Played with in one episode, where Rebecca wins a contest and needs to get her winning entry to a radio station on time to get a large sum, but she's too busy to get it mailed herself. She knows that Baloo is lazy except when something doesn't matter, so she tries to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReversePsychology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReversePsychology">Reverse Psychology</a>, telling him that she'd appreciate it if he could take care of mailing it out for her, but that it wasn't important. Unfortunately for her, Baloo, already experienced with how much trouble arises from her hardheadedness and blind ambition, figures that her <em>laissez-faire</em> attitude means it really isn't important, so he spends the fare for the letter on himself (after Rebecca said he could keep the change) and sends it via the cheapest possible postage. Cue scramble when both parties realize what they had done.
</li></ul></li><li> Ulysses Feral from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SWATKats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SWATKats">SWAT Kats</a></em> invokes this for the title heroes' <em>origin</em>; despite clearly being told they had a target lock, his stubborn obsession to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyOneAllowedToDefeatYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyOneAllowedToDefeatYou">the only one allowed to bring Dark Kat down</a> not only caused the Enforcers to <em>lose</em> the villain (which the aforementioned target lock <em>would've</em> likely prevented), but also forced Jake and Chance into the crash that ended their Enforcer career and began their career as the titular gang. True, there would be no cartoon, but at least they would've been able to bring a dangerous criminal to justice. Even after the incident, Feral insists on fighting against the SWAT Kats and bringing them to "justice", even though it's been shown time and time again <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootingSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootingSuperman">the supervillains they deal with are more than the Enforcers can handle, on their own</a>, and other, more reasonable members of his force (like his niece Felina) can see the benefit of allying themselves with them.

<ul><li> Good thing the Decepticons never thought of getting rid of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">Starscream</a>. He's the only reason the Autobots kept surviving, or even <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_16954_5-reasons-megatron-should-have-fired-starscream-years-ago.html">woke up in the first place<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. One time he even saved the cornered Autobots just for the sake of ruining Megatron's plans. Right in front of him, complete with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">smug one-liner</a>. The first episode had a scene where he seemed to have the right idea for once (suggesting blowing up the Ark instead of boarding it; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouldHaveAvoidedThisPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouldHaveAvoidedThisPlot">the attempted boarding is what leads to the Ark crashing to begin with</a>), but then a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedScene">Deleted Scene</a> was uncovered years later where Megatron <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">spells out why Starscream's idea was horrible</a> (Megatron knew the Autobots were heading to an energy-rich planet, but didn't know it's exact location, hence why he wanted to follow or commandeer their ship, and why blowing them up would be counterproductive to his long-term goals).
</li><li> In the episode referenced in the above example, Megatron <em>did</em> actually say "No, I want to know what [the Autobots] are after." in response to Starscream's hasty and reckless suggestion.
</li><li> There are also times where Starscream points out glaring flaws in Megatron's plans (i.e. the dangerous instability of their latest energy source). Megatron will invariably respond by mocking and insulting him and ignoring his advice, only to be surprised when the plan blows up in his face in exactly the way Starscream predicted. The real solution would be for them to just work together rather than constantly try to one-up each other, then worry about fighting for control after the Autobots are out of the way.
</li><li> Thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">extremely varied nature of the franchise and it's many continuities</a>, how much this trope applies depends on the series. Sometimes, Megatron does sum up the intellect to kill Starscream; he does so in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersTheMovie">the movie</a> after one betrayal nearly succeeds, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersCyberverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersCyberverse">Transformers: Cyberverse</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he kills Starscream after the <em>first</em> backstab</span>, and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">he practically makes killing Starscream a habit.</a> In other series, Megatron has good reason to keep Starscream around, such as wanting an incompetent backstabber as his second-in-comand, rather than risk having a <em>competent</em> one who might actually depose him, or feeling that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">Starscream's skill as an Air Commander makes up for his eccentricities</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem">Jem</a></em>, the rival band of Jem and the Holograms (The Misfits) would often indulge in felonies such as kidnapping, blackmail, sabotage, slander and even attempted murder in order to boost their own sales and discredit their opponents. A simple phone call to the police would have seen them locked up for a very long time. Made worse by the fact that Jerrica <em>owns Starlight Music</em> and could probably do a lot more to ensure that Eric Raymond would stop causing trouble as a record executive than a pop idol. Raymond had his own army of lawyers and mega corp resources, plus Pizzazz's wealthy father and all <em>his</em> connections. The pilot episode also stated the reason for the Jem persona in the first place was due to some first-rate legal and financial blackmail Raymond was laying on Starlight Records (he had a stake in the company as Benton's business partner and was trying to screw Jerica and Kimber out of their shares). Worse, most of the Holograms' royalties got folded back into the business and orphanage. Raymond wasn't bothering with side ventures.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987)</a></em>, almost every time Shredder and Krang fail it is because of Bebop and Rocksteady's bumbling. Simply getting rid of the two or at least locking them up would result in far less humilation for Shredd-Head and Krang.
<ul><li> In one episode Krang points out that Shredder firing them is a bad idea, as they don't have a lot of options in the help department for their schemes. Their attempt to solve this problem blows up in their faces.
</li><li> This gets taken to the logical conclusion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TurtlesForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TurtlesForever">Turtles Forever</a></em>, in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Utrom Shredder, AKA a villain that was besting three separate generations of Turtles as well as fairly powerful allies, has already <em>destroyed entire universes,</em> and is <em>scarily competent...</em> is defeated by their screwing up</span>.
</li><li> Building the universe-conquering superweapon with a working power source would have done it. Given some of the stuff they used to get it temporarily working, it probably could have run at full power on a diesel engine.
</li></ul></li><li> Nicely subverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Squidbillies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Squidbillies">Squidbillies</a></em> episode "A Sober Sunday." Early Cuyler spends the episode trying to lift the banning of liquor sales on Sunday, but is unable to do so. At the end of the episode Granny asks why he doesn't just buy his Sunday liquor on Saturday. He throws her in a fire and claims that it's too inconvenient.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyAndTheBrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyAndTheBrain">Pinky and the Brain</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">considering how many times he screws them up,</a> if Brain got rid of Pinky or at least kept him as far away from his plans as he could manage, he'd rule the world within a week, if that.
<ul><li> It would seem so - but in "That Smarts," Pinky becomes as intelligent as Brain, to the delight of the latter... until a) Pinky starts indicating flaws in every single planet-conquering scheme and b) Brain realizes that the <em>only</em> way any of his plans will succeed is if one of them is an idiot. So he makes himself as "smart" (i.e. as stupid) as Pinky normally is... unfortunately, Pinky's seen how miserable Brain is now that the balance of power has shifted, and he makes himself as stupid as he was before! Needless to say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">this doesn't stick</a> for the rest of the series.
</li><li> It's been established in several episodes that Brain's plans are precisely what keeps them from succeeding. Pinky has come extremely close several times just by doing all the random things that come naturally to him, only for Brain to ruin it when he tries to use their position of power to his advantage for one of his schemes. Then there's the time they took a night off, and unknowingly ended up with a large group of people who wanted to find Brain and put him in charge. Basically, they'd rule the world already if they didn't keep trying to force it.
</li></ul></li><li> The subplot in one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em> episode involved the characters being assigned lab partners for a school science project (and Mr. Barkin wouldn't allow them to switch). Kim is paired with a genius scientist who neither needs nor wants her help, and as a result Kim is left bored and unsatisfied because she has nothing to do. Kim's friend Monique is paired with Ron, and she is over-stressed because Ron just doesn't care and leaves her to do all the work herself. Kim and Monique could have simply worked together on Monique's project unofficially (most of the project seemed to take place outside of school) and that way all four parties would have got a decent grade and a workload that suited them.
<ul><li> Of course if Mr. Barkin ever found out, this would likely result in 4 F's given the stern way he implied that any requests for a new partner would be turned down.

<ul><li> The episode "A Knight of Shadows" has the heroes trying to keep the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhilosophersStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhilosophersStone">Philosopher's Stone</a> away from Morgan Le Fay. When they acquire it, they lock it in the Watchtower—and it ends up being stolen. The story concludes with the stone being crushed to dust—which raises the question of why they bothered to lock it in the Watchtower in the first place. Partially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> in that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter">Martian Manhunter</a> is the one crushing it - it could be protected against earthly threat, or he could be using strength greater than Superman's; the League also didn't have any way to know if it would explode upon being destroyed.
</li><li> Similarly in "Paradise Lost", where the League are forced to retrieve three artifacts that combine into the key that can free the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Sealed Evil in a Can</a>.

</li><li> Also in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock">Static Shock</a></em> JL crossover, with the League keeping the last piece of Brainiac in the Watchtower.

Tirek's plan is to use his Rainbow of Darkness <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReforgedIntoAMinion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReforgedIntoAMinion">to turn ponies into demonic dragons</a> to drive his Chariot of Darkness to cause <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNightThatNeverEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNightThatNeverEnds">The Night That Never Ends</a>, even though the Rainbow of Darkness can also turn non-sentient animals such as butterflies and birds into dragons that appear more than capable of driving the chariot. There was no particular reason why Tirek needs ponies-turned-dragons to drive his chariot; if he stuck to the dragons resulting from other animals, he wouldn't have to deal with the surviving ponies at his doorstep who wound up killing him during the rescue of their friends.
</li><li> Anyone who's watched <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> for so long can tell you that many conflicts in many episodes are started by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone">Peter's</a> anti-social behavior, lack of intelligence or any kind of common sense, or straight up recklessness.

<ul><li> The Freedom Fighters constantly take Antoine along on missions. Compared to powerhouses such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg">Bunnie</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingFirepower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingFirepower">Dulcy</a>, who are only nominally used, Antoine is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">The Load</a> and often screws up missions via his clumsiness. The glaring aspect of this is that it is implied to be Sally, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan">Straight Man</a> of the group, that insists on bringing Antoine along, compared to Sonic who loathes Antoine and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">often lampshades his incompetence.</a>
</li><li> Sonic never takes the opportunity to kill or capture Robotnik after his defeat, despite the <em>heroes' whole goal</em> being to actually overthrow him. At one point Sonic even handily invades his lair and gives him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle">Curbstomp Battle</a> solely as a distraction, despite it being an ideal opportunity to take him in. Ironically Antoine actually <em>did</em> try to capture Robotnik once, though he was obviously outmatched.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em>, like the movies, has some moments of the characters being doofuses when it comes to solving problems.
<ul><li> In the second episode of Season 2, "Cargo of Doom", Cad Bane captures Ahsoka, and uses her as leverage to get Anakin to open a holocron he stole in the previous episode. Anakin could've pulled an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISurrenderSuckers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISurrenderSuckers">I Surrender, Suckers</a> moment on Cad Bane and pretend he's going to unlock the holocron, but not do it all, and instead use the Force to grab both his lightsaber and Ahsoka's while Bane is distracted by the holocron being levitated by the Force, kick Bane's butt, and save Ahsoka, AND prevent the holocron information from being unlocked, instead of playing it all real and opening it for him like he does in the actual episode before he attempts the lightsaber thing, which enables Bane to start kidnapping Force-sensitive infants in the next episode.
</li><li> In "Voyage of Temptation", when Obi-Wan finally finds Tal Merrick, who kidnapped the Duchess of Mandalore, Satine, he demands that Merrick surrender and release the duchess. Sen. Merrick then shows that he holds a remote detonator, and has set explosives on the ship. One press of a button, and everybody on it is blown to kingdom come. Obi-Wan never thinks of using the Force to pull the detonator out of Merrick's hand, which could've made saving Satine a LOT easier, and just follows Merrick (who still holds the detonator <em>and</em> is still holding Satine hostage) back to one of the droid deployers, where he plans to get off the Coronet, and does NOTHING about stopping him from blowing up the ship! And even Satine steps on Merrick's corn to get free from him and steals his blaster, when Merrick taunts them about the cons of either Obi-Wan or Satine killing him will tarnish their reputations, Obi-Wan still doesn't think of using the Force to pull the remote out of his hand. It's up to Anakin to resolve the situation, which he <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">does</a></em> do in the simplest and most direct manner <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by casually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolenceReallyIsTheAnswer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolenceReallyIsTheAnswer">stabbing Merrick through the back with his lightsaber</a> mid-monologue</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Villainous example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>: None of the villains ever realize that knocking out Twilight (and later Starlight in Chrysalis' case) is a much better idea than just breaking her spirit and/or denying her access to her magic.
<ul><li> Meanwhile, considering that Twilight was able to block Discord's magic near the end of Season 2's premiere, there's no reason for the Mane Six to <em>not</em> use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> on the other villains as well, since the villains rely exclusively on their magic.
</li></ul></li><li> Virtually every episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FantasticFourWorldsGreatestHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FantasticFourWorldsGreatestHeroes">Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes</a></em> involves a catastrophe either A. started when Reed Richards' latest invention malfunctions, B. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">triggered by Johnny Storm's stupidity</a>, or C. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs">set off when Johnny Storm's stupidity causes Reed Richards' latest invention to malfunction</a>. Yes, it shows how the Fantastic Four aren't superheroes, but a superpowered family who gets into trouble, but it still applies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine">Thomas the Tank Engine</a></em>: Several plots (especially in the later seasons) could have been avoided had the engines done their jobs correctly... or if Sir Topham Hatt just simply imported some new staff from the mainland instead of using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompetenceInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompetenceInc">the incompetent people he has piloting his engines</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wunschpunsch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wunschpunsch">Wunschpunsch</a></em>: With Bubonic and Tyrannia's spells caused by the Wunschpunsch constantly broken, Maledictus T. Maggot doesn't realize that firing them is easier than repeatedly punishing them each time they fail (then again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeorgeJetsonJobSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeorgeJetsonJobSecurity">George Jetson Job Security</a> might be in effect).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WackyRaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WackyRaces">Wacky Races</a></em>: With all of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat">cheating attempts constantly failing</a>, one wonders why Dick Dastardly just doesn't try racing fairly, or better yet, quit the Wacky Races for good.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DastardlyAndMuttleyInTheirFlyingMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DastardlyAndMuttleyInTheirFlyingMachines">Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines</a></em> suffers from a worser example of this trope than <em>Wacky Races</em>: the Vulture Squadron destroyed 182 planes, 2 balloons, 1 ship, 1 Zeppelin, 1 gas station and 1 train throughout their quest to "Stop the Pigeon" but never caught Yankee Doodle Pigeon. It never occurs to Dick Distardly that he could just shoot Yankee Doodle to bits with a gun-equipped fighter plane.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicUnderground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicUnderground">Sonic Underground</a></em>: Most of the events could have been avoided had Queen Aleena ignored the Oracle's words and then had Robotnik killed before he could try to remove her from the throne (hence all "the Oracle is the actual villain" WMG theories).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em>:
<ul><li> Plankton would be better off creating his own burger instead of constantly trying to steal the Krabby Patty Secret Formula. Or better yet, close the Chum Bucket and take up a different profession.
<ul><li> He managed to create an AI from scratch. He could be a respected computer scientist with no extra trouble at all.
</li></ul></li><li> Plankton could also just get someone to secretly buy him a Krabby Patty instead of trying to steal it.
<ul><li> Or he could take an unfinished Krabby Patty from the trash in the Krusty Krab dumpster.
</li></ul></li><li> In the episode "The Algae's Always Greener", Plankton creates a machine that puts him in a reality where he owns the Krusty Krab. Rather than use the opportunity to learn the secret formula completely unopposed, he instead chooses to just bask in the glory of owning a successful restaurant.
</li><li> Ms. Puff swore to herself when she opened her boating school that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonGivingUpSchoolGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonGivingUpSchoolGuy">she would never give up on a student, ever</a>. As a result, Spongebob has remained a constant thorn at her side because he not only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivesLikeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivesLikeCrazy">Drives Like Crazy</a> but he becomes a titanic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingDisasterArea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingDisasterArea">Walking Disaster Area</a> every time he sits behind a wheel and it has driven her so far up the wall with the misfortunes he's forced her to endure that she has become physically ill from all the stress and she has actually tried to <strong>kill him</strong> repeatedly in order to try to get rid of him. By this point, it's pretty clear that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">she probably would have a better life if she made an exception to her promise, just this once, and kicked him out of her school</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ShadowRaiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ShadowRaiders">Shadow Raiders</a></em>, our heroes try to destroy the Beast Planet. Constantly. It NEVER WORKS; they ram multiple moons and planets into the thing and it just keeps chugging forward. The show would have been over quicker had our heroes tried to go into the Beast Planet without getting killed and try to locate a self-destruct button or something, activate the self-destruct sequence, and let the Beast Planet explode into dust. Hell, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LazyTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LazyTown">Robbie Rotten</a> defeated it easily <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI23rx53lPo">with only a curtain<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow">Regular Show</a></em>, Benson would really save himself an awful lot of headaches (and risking of life, limb, reputation and sanity) if he followed through with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeorgeJetsonJobSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeorgeJetsonJobSecurity">his constant threatening to fire Mordecai and Rigby</a> and actually did it. Even when several episodes show that everybody else in the cast is capable of pulling off a faux-pas that causes absurd and <em>apocalyptic</em> chaos just as well as those two (and thus they need to save the day), from a strictly statistical point of view it would have been much safer.
</li><li> Many plots in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Hurricanes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Hurricanes">Hurricanes</a></em> could have been avoided had Amanda and co. simply made a phone call to the police to get Stavros Garkos locked up for good.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a></em> is one of the biggest examples of this trope in animation. For all his genius, Dexter is never able to keep Dee-Dee out of his laboratory. It never occurs to him that he could just use an ID checkup system for the entrance to his lab and keep Dee-Dee out for good, or (more drastically) kill her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug">Miraculous Ladybug</a></em>: At least a partial amount of the power <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateLiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateLiar">Lila Rossi</a> has over her classmates because of her constant lying would be gone if someone made some fact-checking (she says she got tinnitus because she saved Jagged Stone's cat - a Wikipedia search would have revealed that Stone has always been allergic to pet fur since he was a <em>child</em> (hence why he owns a freaking <em>alligator</em>), which would make her attempt at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts">Moving the Goalposts</a> when Marinette calls her out on it even more blatant) or had common sense (Lila lies about having conditions (like the aforementioned tinnitus) that would demand for the school's administration to ask her to hand over her medical records, and escalates to the point she flat-out says that she has a psych condition that makes her lie all the time... which is accepted, with no psych confirming it <em>or</em> having anybody question any of her previous statements, if she now is a <em>certified</em> pathological liar).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em>: Aku tries to invoke this with a simple yet remarkably effective plan. He destroys every single time portal in existence so that Jack can't make it back to his own time and then retreats into hiding to wait out the years until Jack dies of old age. The problem? When Aku first flung Jack into the past, he accidentally made Jack <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless">The Ageless</a> without realizing it, so now Jack <em>can't</em> die of old age. Oops.
