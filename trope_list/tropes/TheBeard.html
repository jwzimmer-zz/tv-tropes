So her best friend/therapist Makoto suggests Megumi use her younger brother Mikoto as a beard—knowing full well that Mikoto's interest in Megumi is genuine—because a) it's fun to tease her little brother and b) a little respectful, gentle male attention may just be the ticket for Megumi.

Since Kanako really is a closet lesbian, this could have been a pretty original and interesting side plot... but unfortunately the matter got dropped for no adequately explained reason and nothing ever came of it.

</li><li> In the anime version, Ryouko Momoi agreed to temporarily be Namura-sensei's beard in regards to Meiko Akizuki; he thought he wasn't worth all the trouble Meiko had already gone through, and wanted her to be free. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Eventually, when this messed up Meiko <em>even more</em>, Ryouko grew tired and told her the truth.

Also is this trope in the more traditional sense in that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yuri</span> is apparently gay or bisexual.
</li><li> In one issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MonthlyGirlsNozakiKun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MonthlyGirlsNozakiKun">Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun</a></em>, Mikoshiba needs a fake girlfriend to drive off an unwanted admirer.

However, after a girl who has already played this game reincarnates as Katarina, she manages to utterly charm him while now she isn't interested in the slightest since she knows he's secretly a jerk as well as having met him when he was just a kid from her perspective. When she tries to call off the engagement later by pointing out the reason for it<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13zf4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13zf4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13zf4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">he accidentally scarred her forehead</span> was no longer meaningful, he refuses.

<ul><li> English actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesLaughton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesLaughton">Charles Laughton</a> married Elsa Lanchester (of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrideOfFrankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrideOfFrankenstein">Bride of Frankenstein</a></em> fame) yet continued to see men. One day, Lanchester came home to find Laughton on the sofa <em>in flagrante delicto</em> with a rent boy. She told him that she didn't mind, but went completely mute for three months in shock. She later told a friend that she'd had no idea Laughton was gay, but added, "Remember, he was a <em>great</em> actor!" They never divorced.
</li><li> A few years ago, Ian Wishart claimed that the then-Prime Minister of New Zealand, Helen Clark, was a lesbian with a gay husband. Controversy ensued.
</li><li> According to the celebrity gossip blogs and their commenters, any woman who dates a handsome young Hollywood celebrity is a beard, because every last one of them is gay. Even when these men are serial monogamists who eventually marry, they're still gay, and the women they date are sniffily referred to as "the professional beard" and given the side-eye from there on in. Not surprisingly, Hollywood doesn't seem to have a large population of sexually active women (straight or lesbian) or conventionally unnattractive gay men, as the wishfully thinking gays and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Slash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Slash">Slash</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealPersonFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealPersonFic">RPF</a> fangirls that populate these boards don't have any use for them.
<ul><li> Spoofed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KathyGriffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KathyGriffin">Kathy Griffin</a> in her special <em>Strong Black Woman</em>: "I love how the gay guys only want hot guys to be gay, right? They want Gyllenhaal, they want Ledger, they want Colin Farrell. Here's what you'll never hear from one of the gays: 'Oh, girl. Don't be naive. Don't tell me you don't know about Miss Gene Hackman.'"
</li></ul></li><li> In China, because of the immense pressure to get married and have kids, somewhere around 80% of the gay population marries straight people. This has resulted in an interesting phenomenon where various places will host <a class="urllink" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2279907">"fake-marriage markets"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where gay and lesbian people can meet and look for someone who is willing to play the beard for them (and vice versa).
</li><li> Played for laughs — English comedian Barry Cryer was classified "honorary gay" by his close friend Kenny Everett. Kenny insisted that his wife of 40 years and four kids were just a smokescreen.
</li><li> Rock Hudson's three-year marriage to Phyllis Gates was done for this reason.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FranDrescher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FranDrescher">Fran Drescher</a> lived this trope for 18 years before her husband found out he was gay. It became the basis for her show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappilyDivorced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappilyDivorced">Happily Divorced</a></em>, and she and her ex-husband are now very much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmicableExes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmicableExes">Amicable Exes</a> after a period of not speaking to each other.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurCClarke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurCClarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a> had a very, very, very brief marriage, entered into with very little notice and exited within a period of months. Despite his admission (in his biography <em>Odyssey</em>) of bisexual experiences and his statement that "we're all a little polymorphously perverse", he never formally came out of the closet. Later in life he faced accusations of paederasty and homosexual paedophilia, which delayed his acceptance of a knighthood (at his request) until they had been put to rest. One is left to draw one's own conclusions.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PortiaDeRossi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PortiaDeRossi">Portia De Rossi</a> was married to Mel Metcalfe and indicated that she married him for two reasons: US residency and to help her acting career by appearing straight.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BettyWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BettyWhite">Betty White</a> revealed in an interview that she had sometimes served as the beard to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Liberace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Liberace">Liberace</a>, in case that would have convinced anyone he was straight.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ColePorter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ColePorter">Cole Porter</a> and his wife, Linda, were mutual beards. Their marriage allowed Cole to hide his homosexuality and allowed Linda to be seen as socially acceptable without having to have sex, which she was turned off of after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">an abusive first marriage</a>. Despite not being romantic, they did genuinely like each other, and remained married until Linda's death.

They were friends and remained technically married until Erica died from a brain tumor in 1969, but for obvious reasons, there was no romance involved between them.
