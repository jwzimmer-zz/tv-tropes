<div class="indent">— <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a></strong>, Statement to an Indiana Regiment passing through Washington (17 March 1865)
</div></div><p>A situation in which Bob is in favor of some action, revolution, or social system because he assumes that he will be in the group that benefits from it (or fails to realize that he will be in the group that will suffer). Almost inevitably, Bob will be proven wrong, with the double whammy of knowing he <em>supported</em> the measure that caused his suffering when he thought it would happen to somebody else.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Imagine that Bob attends a banquet for 200 people at the mayor's house. When he arrives, he is informed that they made an error when ordering the food — there is enough steak for the first 100 guests, but everyone else will have to make do with vegetables. Bob, looking around and seeing the room less than half full, says he thinks this is fair. Only afterward does he see the <em>second</em> dining room, filled up with people who arrived earlier, and realize that he isn't going to be in the group that gets a full dinner.
</p><p>Poor Bob. He would have been wiser to remember the thought experiment from which this trope takes its name: John Rawls' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/OriginalPositionFallacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/OriginalPositionFallacy">"original position"</a>, which says that the only fair laws are those passed from behind the hypothetical "veil of ignorance" (i.e. you don't know whether you'll be on the good or the bad side of the change). Bob might have suggested giving out half portions of steak so that all the guests could have some meat. Unfortunately, he wasn't willing to give away half of "his" steak and the result was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">missed steak.</a>
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The main upshot of this trope is to show that blind self-interest is a bad thing  Bob shouldn't have been so quick to give "someone else" a steak-less dinner when he thought <em>his</em> meal would be fine. If he is fortunate, it will turn out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a>, and he will have a second chance to approach the topic  probably with a bit more humility this time. But in many cases it's too late for regrets: Bob has his vegetables, and now he must eat them. (Some uses of this trope begin in Act 2, where Bob is now in the thick of a miserable situation and laments that he used to <em>want</em> this to happen.)
</p><p>Of course, it is also possible that the mayor  who <em>did</em> know the outcome and <em>could</em> assign the menu options  steered Bob into making a choice that was worse for him, perhaps to damn him by his own words. Call it an "Original Position Gambit" if you will. This trope is also one of the places where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheTable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheTable">Off the Table</a> doesn't shift sympathy away from the person who refuses to re-extend the offer. ("Oh, Bob wants to make a more generous division <em>now</em>? Too bad.")

Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWillBellTheCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWillBellTheCat">Who Will Bell the Cat?</a>, where attempts to make a change that would benefit most at the cost of a few are stalled by the fact that no one wants to be "the few."

This fallacy also causes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist">Prophecy Twist</a> or several - someone hearing a prophecy think it'll come true on terms that'll be favourable to them, or they'll <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoManOfWomanBorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoManOfWomanBorn">never be in a situation where the prophecy might screw them over</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>: Danzo was all in favor of instructing his ninjas to sacrifice themselves if need be, in part because his own high rank made his chances of doing so himself extremely low. In a rare variation of this trope, he was aware of this hypocrisy and hated himself for it. Even more so because when he was younger, he hesitated at a crucial moment and instead it was his master the Second Hokage who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">sacrificed himself for the sake of the village</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>, Light Yagami spends much of the series as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist">The Social Darwinist</a>, believing that anyone he kills with the Death Note was evil, incompetent, or for the greater good and deserved to die. When it comes time for his own death, however, he is the only character who does not die peacefully, refusing to accept his end. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the manga, at least, he screams and pleads with anyone to try to extend his own life once Ryuk writes Light's name into his own Death Note. In other versions, once he's been identified as the wielder of the Death Note, Light makes a run for it.</span> That is, Light considers anyone who dies in his scheme to have deserved their deaths, until he gets caught in it.

One is known as greedy and selfish; the other is known as having helped the father and for being honorable. No one can tell which son is which. Ooka picks one son at random and tells him to divide the estate using tokens representing the various assets.

Ahasuerus thinks it's a great idea — and then tells him to go do just that for Mordecai, Haman's hated rival who had foiled an assassination plot but was never rewarded properly. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga">And it just gets worse for Haman after that.</a>

It's outright encouraged in general, and one of the realms is designed so it's hard to NOT play it this way. This realm is called Oppia, and is a place of abundant soul-energy in the form of delicious food. The rulers are very generous and hospitable, and their rules seem simple enough. Sure, the system runs on enslavement of souls, but those idiots are bad guests who broke the rules. Seems easy enough to accept... until you realize how <em>very</em> easy it actually is to break the rules. Including by accident.

This led to the Wars of Reaving, which saw the destruction of many of the Clans and several others being forced to flee to the Inner Sphere. Finally, he declared that all the tainted Clans had been destroyed, only for Khan Stanislov NButa of Clan Star Adder to remind him that there was one Clan that had been tainted by its time in the Inner Sphere left: Clan Steel Viper. Andrews challenged him to an unarmed duel, then killed him with a laser pistol, violating both the prohibition of carrying weapons into the Clan Council and the honor of the duel, which the other assembled Khans used as evidence that N'Buta was right. The Steel Vipers promptly became the final Clan to be destroyed for being tainted by the Inner Sphere. For added irony, the Steel Vipers were the only Clan that had actually occupied a part of the Inner Sphere that were wiped out in the Wars of Reaving, all the other Clans that invaded the Inner Sphere either survived (Clan Jade Falcon, Clan Wolf, Clan Ghost Bear, Clan Snow Raven, Clan Diamond Shark, Clan Nova Cat) or were destroyed prior to the Wars of Reaving (Clan Smoke Jaguar, Clan Ice Hellion). The other Clans that were destroyed were ones that had never gone to the Inner Sphere.

<ul><li> Invoked in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1">the first game</a> in one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypticLog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypticLog">Apocalyptic Logs</a>; the speaker says that when intelligent, hard-working, and powerful individuals from the surface are invited to come to Rapture and help build a world of pure capitalistic freedom, they accept because they think they'll be captains of industry like they would be on the surface. They then find out that, even in a capitalist heaven, "someone needs to clean the toilets". It seems that nobody, not even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurFounder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurFounder">Andrew</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope">Ryan</a>, fully realised that if you have an entire city comprised solely of the human race's elite, those who could be great leaders when surrounded by normal people to do the menial work, won't be special any more when everyone is just as clever and driven as they are. Apparently, this unwelcome discovery contributed heavily to the people's rapid disillusionment with Rapture, and Ryan realising that there were people who could compete with him as equals helped spur an already self-centred narcissist past the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> to stay on top.
</li><li> This is also discussed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock2">the second game</a> where you find out the backstory of the railroad that connects the various parts of the city. Ryan and his supporters invested heavily in the railroad, but it was quickly upstaged by the invention of the bathysphere and the railroad went bankrupt. Ryan's followers never considered that their own investments could go sour and were confronted by the fact that they were about to find themselves broke and on the bottom of the economic and social system of Rapture. Faced with losing his power base, Ryan forced a bank bailout for the railroad, which saved the investors' fortunes but destroyed the savings of everyone else. Rapture's economy went into a downward spiral, which resulted in the civil war that wrecked the city.
</li><li> While not as prevalent, the fallacy is also reflected in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioshockInfinite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioshockInfinite">Bioshock Infinite</a></em> regarding Comstock's flying paradise for the American People. Fink realized that none of the white, wealthy, religious patrons who'd flock to Comstock's city as "God's Kingdom" would be eager to do manual labor or menial tasks to maintain the 'heavenly' city, so he brought in "Cherubs for every chore", i.e. a massive foreign labor force that would eventually revolt and become the Vox Populi.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDragonPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDragonPrince">The Dragon Prince</a></em>: When King Harrow was crowned, he told his wife about a dream he had where Lady Justice came to him and offered him a gift. He took her blindfold, and she explained how he should try to imagine he was not born with the wealth or position he has, or even the culture or skin color. Later in the episode he tries to make good on this promise by offering supplies to a nearby kingdom suffering a famine — they don't have much to spare, so the same amount of people will starve, but half of them will be from his kingdom instead of all from his ally. However, he stumbles a bit when his court wizard offers him an alternative; kill a powerful magical creature and use its heart to bring fertility to the land. His wife points out that they don't even know if the creature is intelligent. They ultimately go through with it and it works, but it kicks off a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge">Cycle of Revenge</a> that results in Harrow's wife dead, the queens of the allied kingdom dead, himself dead years later, and brings the land within inches of war.

<ul><li> This is what's behind the "cut and choose" method of sharing treats. Typically, when two children are sharing a cookie or cupcake or something like that, one child divides the treat into two portions, but the other child gets to pick which portion he/she wants, making it wise for the first child to cut it as evenly as possible.
</li><li> The kinds of people who think living in a post-apocalyptic world would be "cool" tend to use this fallacy. They assume that, in a world with no law, order, or government, they could do whatever they want and would thrive. But they fail to realize that the whole "do whatever you want" thing wouldn't just apply to themselves, it would apply to <em>everyone else</em>. Many think that "raiding a store" would be sufficient enough to let them live comfortably, ignoring that pretty much everyone else would be trying to raid the stores too — and without farms or other agricultural infrastructure, sooner or later the stores will just run out. If you want to survive at all, you're pretty much forced to go back to subsistence farming and premodern standards of living. Have fun!
<ul><li> This also presumes that they will survive to be part of the post-apocalypse in the first place. Every doomsday-prepper presumes they won't get killed during a nuclear war, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a>, a meteor shower, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">alien</a> or demonic invasion... etc. Those who yearn for the Rapture also assume that they will be one of those taken to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heaven">Heaven</a> (especially if their confession mentions having limited seats). Many disaster movies don't clearly portray what you can comfortably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferredHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferredHolocaust">presume are &gt;90% human casualties</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Eugenics proponents generally assume that the populations which have favorable genes are theirs and the populations which need to die off are not their own (nor anyone they know). Similarly, those who prophesy a Malthusian catastrophe unless the human population level drops (through war, pandemic, or the like) tend to assume that "those other people" will be the ones to kick off and leave room for everyone else.
</li><li> For a variant, conspiracy theorists tend to think like this, but <em>in the present tense.</em> They assume that whatever chemical has been fed into the water supply, or whatever radio waves are dumbing down the populace, that <em>they</em> are somehow immune and therefore able to perceive the truth, and are not one of the "sheeple" that they so deride.
</li><li> Kevin Drum once wrote on his belief that hardcore libertarianism is built on this trope.
<div class="indent"><strong>Drum:</strong> It's a fantasy where the strongest and most self-reliant folks end up at the top of the heap, and a fair number of men share the fantasy that <em>they</em> are these folks. They believe they've been held back by rules and regulations designed to help the weak, and in a libertarian culture their talents would be obvious and they'd naturally rise to positions of power and influence. <br/><br/>Most of them are wrong, of course. In a truly libertarian culture, nearly all of them would be squashed like ants — mostly by the same people who are squashing them now. But the fantasy lives on regardless.
</div></li><li> This is considered to be one of the main reasons that many libertarian communes/free cities have failed: in theory it sounds nice to live in a place where you don't pay any taxes or have any regulations telling you how to live your life, but it quickly becomes a burden when there isn't a central authority that maintains the roads, makes sure the power and water grids are maintained, keeps a force of professional firefighters and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EMTs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EMTs">EM Ts</a> around for emergencies, or take care of any of the other things that often get taken for granted in an ordinary city. There's an idea that businesses will flock to the place thanks to its lack of regulation or taxes, but the truth is that most companies don't want to locate a factory in a place where the phone lines, power, water, or roads are unreliable. And residents have a bad habit of assuming that unpleasant jobs like garbage collection are "someone else's" job, leading to it never getting done.
</li><li> For that matter, any political leaning that requires either people being inherently better than others or will presumably reward those who are legitimately better will be championed by people who assume they will be the ones on top, regardless of whether or not they would actually be.
</li><li> When people ask one another, for fun, "If you could live in any historical time period, what would it be," the question contains the assumption that the answer does not include being a humble peasant, who would usually live the extremely mundane life of some Joe Schmoe (even if it was not without its joys).
<ul><li> This is one of the arguments made against the existence of reincarnation: it's remarkable how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence">a vastly disproportionate number of people who claim to be able to remember their "past lives" seem to have lived exciting, colorful, and varied lives among the gentry, rather than the more mundane ones among the peasantry</a>. (Though one could argue that, with past lives being as hard to remember as they already are, a past life of a nameless ordinary person would be downright impossible to recall, and out of hundreds or even thousands of past lives, the odds are that at least a handful of them were interesting.)
</li><li> Ditto for anyone who asks about living in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse">some fictional universe</a>. Some of them seem very interesting... as long as you're a member of that universe's elite or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a> and/or a member of his band of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>. The person responding tends to forget that the chances of actually being this lucky are slim.
</li><li> Additionally, the outcome depends if you get the skills to survive in an analogy to your trade in that time period. Most of the folks reading this page are completely inept in the needed skills for living in other time periods. Even if you are highly skilled in today's occupations, bordering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnidisciplinaryScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnidisciplinaryScientist">Omnidisciplinary Scientist</a>, very little of that would get you anywhere even a few hundred years ago. Computer coding? Useless. Knowledge of modern sciences? Useless if you can't communicate them, and without the intellectual work needed to get to those conclusions, you would never be believed. Law? Highly time-dependent. Modern trades like welding or electrician? Don't exist. Modern medicine is not possible without a whole array of periphery industries and tools. Even ancient trades like farming or carpentry have changed so much that the learning curve would be nearly vertical. Even writing is a maybe; who knows how to use a quill? It's highly unlikely a modern human knows any of the needed skills to keep a home or engage in useful work in most other time periods, and then there's the language problem.
</li></ul></li><li> Indian and Chinese parents who decide in favor of the abortion of female fetuses, and try for a boy, believing that they will, in twenty years or so, be the ones who get to be paid money for their son's hand in marriage, <em>and</em> obtain a daughter-in-law who will work for them. What they often fail to consider is that everyone else has the same idea, leading to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderRarityValue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderRarityValue">scarcity of women</a>, that might lead to their son not being able to marry at all — the National Population and Family Planning Commission of China estimated that by 2020 there will be 30 million more men than women in the country. The governments can see where this is going and try to counteract it, but the individual people not so much. In China's case the one-child policy that had been in effect for 35 years exacerbated the problem as parents wanted the only child they were allowed to have to be a boy.
</li><li> People who like to use the phrase "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantMakeAnOmelette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantMakeAnOmelette">You Can't Make an Omelette...</a> without breaking a few eggs" rarely volunteer themselves to be the "eggs" to be "broken", or even consider the possibility.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AynRand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AynRand">Ayn Rand</a> would reassure her followers who feared they were the "parasites" she railed against by telling them that because they had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToFlattery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToFlattery">superior taste</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">reading material</a>, they were among the "perfect producers" who would inherit the world.
</li><li> Every politician — especially those of "family values" — who support a discriminatory policy based on 'morality', and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">are then caught by the public</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot">being immoral</a>. Such policies are <em>great</em>... for the people they don't discriminate against, or discriminate in favor of.
</li><li> This theory is behind the quote attributed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnSteinbeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnSteinbeck">John Steinbeck</a>, "Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat, but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires". That is, though they are currently poor, they think they'll be among the tiny number of poor people to become extremely rich somehow, and so are against things intended to help the poor that could be bad for the rich.
</li><li> Communists will often cite how much better society would be if they were allowed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatTheRich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatTheRich">destroy the privileged of the world</a> and spread their assets among the lower class. Few ever consider if they or people they know would be among those brought down or eliminated. A great example would be the many middle-class or even upper-class people who supported the Bolsheviks, only to find that they were now considered part of the elite and executed.
<ul><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Stalinists</a> argue that the purges were necessary and even claim the fact that innocent people were falsely accused and murdered is entirely acceptable because the Soviet Union couldn't afford to find the truth. When asked if they would support a regime that intends to kill them, they nearly uniformly say no.
</li><li> There are lots of rich people who identify with left parties and genuinely support higher income taxes. However, almost none of them support so called "hoard taxes" that tax people for accumulating and not spending obscene amounts of money. In other words, people who have already made it big are willing to take a hit on future income, but will flip out the second someone talks about taxing their past income the same way they plan to tax others in the future.
</li><li> Similar arguments are made against proponents of socialism - sure, getting "free" stuff from the government sounds great until you realize that <em>someone</em> still has to pay for it, and that someone just might be you.
</li><li> Although "you can't use and enjoy products of a capitalist economy and still be a communist" is generally fallacious<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note04l5y');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note04l5y" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note04l5y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">An individual has next to no choice as to what economic system they live under, with virtually all countries in the world (even nominally "communist" ones) now using some form of capitalist economic model; it's also not incongruent or somehow dishonest to live under such a model and wish it was a different one entirely</span>, a kernel of truth is that a lot of mundane pleasures in life <em>are</em> motivated by and organised under the capitalist for-profit model and are not necessarily going to keep existing in the same form or at all if that profit motive disappears or the existing producers of the products no longer exist.
</li><li> Some communists believe that a communist society would provide for artists to contribute towards the arts rather than having to work normal jobs to support themselves, rather ignoring that there would still productive work that needs to be done outside of the arts and that the number of self-described "artists" who like this idea vastly outstrips the capacity of any economy to support otherwise non-productive individuals.
</li></ul></li><li> People arguing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotInMyBackYard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotInMyBackYard">Not In My Back Yard</a> usually fall into a similar trap to the original position fallacy. For example when someone wants to put up an unsightly wind farm near a residential community, not one arguing NIMBY will say wind power is bad, just that it somehow becomes bad when it inconveniences them and not someone else.
</li><li> Many people support expelling immigrants in their home countries, assuming that they will get the leftover jobs. Unfortunately, not all companies are under pressure to hire natives, and many can quite easily outsource work to other countries or replace their lost workers with machinery. Not to mention that a lot of immigrants a) do jobs few people would want to do or b) are business owners and employ others, arguably <em>increasing</em> the total number of jobs.
<ul><li> In much of the Americas and especially the United States, the population consists of a very small minority of pure-blooded natives and the entire rest of the population are descended from immigrants. But everyone assumes nobody will expel <em>their</em> ancestral group and just remove whatever flavor of immigrants are hated at the moment.
</li></ul></li><li> Many anonymous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Trolls</a> defend their offensive behavior online (not to be confused with voicing unpopular but valid opinions) by claiming they're entitled to free speech. They're quick to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">react in horror</a> when other people find out who they really are and exercise <em>their</em> right to free speech to expose them to the public.
<ul><li> On the flip side, people who support mass doxxing and reduction of online privacy in general never consider that <em>their</em> online activities might be exposed and used against them or at least not that they will be viewed as objectionable.
</li></ul></li><li> Conversely, those who support ill-defined "reasonable" restrictions on free speech to curb unpopular viewpoints rarely take into account that popular opinion is constantly shifting and changing. They may find it acceptable to restrict offensive humor, but what if the definition of "offensive" grows broad enough to cover their own brand of humor? Once the precedent has been set that speech can be controlled or punished, nothing is to protect such people should their own ideas or beliefs eventually run afoul of the law.
</li><li> This is one of the reasons of religious individuals who oppose establishing a state religion in their country. Once the precedent is set that the government can favor a specific religion, it could end up not being yours.
</li><li> One of the reasons to advocate for tolerance in general is that one day your religion (or lack thereof), viewpoint, race, or way of life might be either the majority or at least look like it's on the up and up. Then demographics change a little and a few people do some unpleasant things in the name of your side. Suddenly public opinion is against you, and if you weren't advocating tolerance of others, chances are nobody will show any mercy toward you.
<ul><li> Or you become part of the group you hate. For example, there are plenty of people who have been prejudiced against the disabled, only to later become one them.
</li><li> Or often-mocked professions. Sure, you can insult, say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableProfessionalTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableProfessionalTargets">lawyers or the police</a>, going as far to have them abolished. Until you <em>need them</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> General audiences love the idea of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">brutally honest</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">Jerkass with a point</a> taking down people's arguments and worldview with biting wit and ruthless rhetoric...as long as the people they are taking down don't represent them. As soon as said Jerkass brings up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth">uncomfortable truths</a> about <em>them</em> rather than their enemies or another party, they begin demanding civility and understanding, regardless of whether or not they did so for other targets of said Jerkass.
<ul><li> A version of this can be seen in the audiences of stand-up comedians who have racially-charged schticks. Members of the audience will laugh and applaud offensive jokes, and then suddenly stop laughing when the jokes are aimed at their race/gender/whatever. This can vary from culture to culture, however. African-American comedians, for example, have been telling self-deprecating jokes about their own for decades. This <em>would've</em> counted as a subversion, until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChappellesShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChappellesShow">Chappelle's Show</a></em> hit it big, and Chappelle found out that many racists were taking his jokes at face value and using them to justify their beliefs. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModernMinstrelsy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModernMinstrelsy">Modern Minstrelsy</a> for more examples.
</li></ul></li><li> TERFs (Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminists) are a subset <em>of a subset</em> of feminists, who oppose transgender rights and claim that trans women are really men trying to infiltrate women's safe spaces. They tend to ignore the existence of trans men, but when they do acknowledge them, they claim that trans men are actually "poor, helpless women who are suffering from raging cases of internalized misogyny/lesbophobia due to patriarchal oppression." As such, they support politicians who oppose transgender rights, but ignore the fact that the overwhelming majority of politicians who do so are ultra-conservative fundamentalist Christians who also oppose women's rights issues like access to abortion or anti-discrimination laws, on top of opposition to gay rights (which is doubly ironic since a notable portion of TERFs are also lesbian women).
</li><li> Women who've <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter">joined groups characterized by heavy misogyny</a>, like the Islamic State or the Alt-Right, have been surprised to find that they're suddenly expected to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">Stay in the Kitchen</a> and churn out the babies, if not outright being treated (and sold as) sex slaves.
</li><li> Really most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigots">Boomerang Bigots</a> fall under this trope. Most think they have somehow risen above the "flaws inherent to their kind," until evidence arises that plenty of others have too or they haven't. Often both. They also tend to believe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">any laws that would disadvantage their kind wouldn't apply to them or will not be used against them until it is</a>.
</li><li> Most people who advocate using violence to solve problems (especially the lethal kind) think they're the ones in a position of strength. They often aren't. In general, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinist">Social Darwinist</a> who believes in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">Might Makes Right</a> will quickly change his mind if a) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysABiggerFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysABiggerFish">Someone stronger than him is challenging him</a>, b) The 'strongest side' is one that he can't be a part of, or c) The side that 'wins' is one he disagrees with or uses tactics that the Darwinist doesn't associate with "strength", such as subterfuge or treachery (or even is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts">just perceived</a> as using subterfuge or treachery).
</li><li> By a similar token to the above, but from the opposite perspective people who call those that used violence against their oppressors "terrorists" are almost never willing to be the oppressed side. For instance, those that call Nelson Mandela a terrorist wouldn't really want to be on the business end of Apartheid.
</li><li> This is a common point made by both sides in the debate over how society in general, or specific institutions, should handle accusations of various crimes, especially hard-to-prove things like sexual assault. Proponents of swift punishment for accused wrongdoers often overlook that they too might be accused, while those who favor a more gradual and deliberate process often fail to picture themselves as a victim waiting for slow justice.
</li><li> Freidrich Spee was an early opponent of the use of torture, but only after running into this trope. During an encounter with a Duke of Brunswick, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Germany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Germany">Germany</a>, Spee confidently claimed that torture was effective in getting confessions from witches and that only those implicated by tortured witches had anything to worry about. The Duke led Spee to a dungeon, where he had a tortured woman indict <em>him</em> as a witch. Spee was so shaken by this encounter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">that he spent much of life writing against torture</a>. (This story <a class="urllink" href="http://save-send-delete.blogspot.com/2015/02/steven-pinker-and-michael-shermer.html">is just an urban legend though<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.)
</li><li> As noted in the page quote, slavery apologists who argue that slavery really isn't that bad or is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery">actually a good thing</a> will almost never be willing to switch places with a slave. Many such slavery advocates in the Americas (where slavery had been explicitly race-based) would try to justify this by (rather conveniently) arguing that slavery was only meant for black people, ignoring the fact that many cultures had existed (and some still did at the time) where it was considered perfectly acceptable to enslave white people. Indeed, the concept of "white slavery" was generally considered the most horrifying prospect in the world to the same white men who themselves owned black slaves.
</li><li> In the COVID-19 outbreak lockdown, some American commentators suggested allowing a portion of the country to die off so as to "open" the economy from quarantine. Such commentators stopped short of volunteering themselves for such a culling. Conversely, commentators who support an indefinite lockdown while ignoring the economic consequences have been accused of this thinking, since many of them still have work-from-home jobs and government aid; if they were among those who <a class="urllink" href="https://amp.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/21/us-unemployment-figures-jobs-lost-coronavirus">lost their jobs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, are <a class="urllink" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/28/covid-19-crisis-may-lead-20000-cancer-deaths/amp/">unable to get cancer treatments<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and such, the claim goes, they would change their tune.
</li><li> Many people were in favor of weakening government aid for low income and/or making it as difficult as possible to get or keep such benefits. This was ostensibly to motivate people to find a job and only the really needy would jump through so many hoops to get those benefits. Thanks to COVID-19 shutting down economies, millions are out of work with little to no job options and seeking government aid to survive. Those that supported a weak and difficult to use government aid system are finding that the paltry amount they get, if they can even get it, won't cover much more than their most basic needs (rent, utilities, food). The problem is even further exacerbated by these systems being overloaded with numbers they weren't designed to handle.
</li><li> People who are in favor of the addition of extra hoops to jump through to be able to vote, or are against anything that would make voting easier, to make sure as little voting fraud as possible happens tend to assume two things: that all fraudulent votes (or at least a large majority of them) are supporting the candidates they <em>don't</em> want to see elected and that anti-fraud measures won't (at least not significantly) hurt turnout for voters who support the candidates they <em>do</em> want to see elected.
