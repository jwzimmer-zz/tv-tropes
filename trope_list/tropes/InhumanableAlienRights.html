If the general public discovers their true nature, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWouldCutYouUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWouldCutYouUp">could be dissected in a lab</a> or suffer some equally unpleasant fate. Mind you, as sapient beings who look (and possibly are) quite human, they still should enjoy some basic civil rights (even if they aren't documented citizens; not even the most extreme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightWingMilitiaFanatic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightWingMilitiaFanatic">Minuteman Militia</a> member has suggested dissecting illegal aliens). However, this does not stop the government from wanting to imprison the being (without trial, naturally) and use them as subjects in endless (probably painful) experiments.
</p><p>This means said being has to constantly run from the authorities as opposed to going to the nearest court and having a restraining order issued, or perhaps going to the media about it (this is especially jarring when the being can prove its claims), calling 911, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionIsNotFair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionIsNotFair">applying any of the myriad legal remedies that protect everyday people from what amounts to a metric buttload of civil rights violations and outright felonies committed against their person</a>. Somehow, none of the "normal people" notice, and likely wouldn't care if they knew.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The pursuers, who have the power of the FBI, CIA, or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">the Postal Service</a> (hey... don't sneer at the Post Office — the Postal Inspector's office is the only law enforcement arm of any government in the US with a perfect 100% conviction rate) behind them, never seem to realize that they could be arrested for their treatment of the being, losing their careers, reputations, and freedom because of it.
</p><p>Technically, extra-terrestrials, mermaids and other such beings aren't <em>human</em>, granted, so <em>this</em> might explain why they don't use any legal recourse.
</p><p>This technicality does not cover humans who have gained powers, however. Having the ability to fly does not make you non-human. Neither does being in the wrong <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">time</a> or from an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a>. Those are all still human beings, and people in <em>any</em> court of law.

In reality, dead humans still have property rights, that is to say, their estate, although someone else is needed to manage and dissolve it. The dead would presumably have other rights or protections under the law if they asked for them. And while death legally means cessation of brain activity, which vampires may not have, no doctor is going to declare someone dead when they're moving around and talking, so they probably aren't even 'legally dead' in the first place. Zombies and other non-sentient undead on the other hand, might indeed be brain dead, and a doctor might be willing to declare them so. Either way, it's not like a zombie is going to be demanding their rights be recognized. (Or demanding much more than "Braaains!!!").
</p><p>It is worth noticing that "people" have rights, not "humans" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfThePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfThePeople">not that this isn't rocky territory</a>). So if a writer wished to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">ignore</a> the issue, they can mention that courts declared them "people", no need to rewrite any laws or constitutions at all. This isn't all that great a stretch, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> courts have ruled that such bodies as governments, civic organizations and corporations can be recognized as 'persons' so that they can be legally represented and/or sued in criminal/civil cases.
</p><p>Note that this trope is only valid for places in which there are civil rights for humans to begin with. A perfectly ordinary human would have to escape a tyrannical government that was persecuting him as much as any mermaid or vampire.
</p><p>Of course, as many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> events have demonstrated to the world, even places with great (though rarely <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_the_United_States">unassailable<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) reputations for upholding human rights for their own citizens, can and have blatantly ignored said rights when it suits. So maybe the writers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">really are on to something</a>.

As a person she's a Japanese citizen, but her <em>cyborg body</em> is the property of the Japan Self-Defense Force (due to the government footing the bill for creating cyborg bodies for her after she was injured in a car crash while in the womb) so for all practical purposes she's government property. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She's emancipated at the end of the first episode.</span>

(Their bodies are crushed but the one man in the organisation who's twigged they're on different sides saves their brain modules.)

Hellboy (demon), Abe (fishman), Krausse (disembodied ghost) and Roger (homonculus) are all legally recognized as people with full rights through their service to the B.P.R.D., though there's some debate over Roger at first.

Equestria is acknowledged by pretty much the rest of the world as a sovereign country, and most ponies that travel to other countries not only have human rights, but diplomatic privileges as well. But once the world declares war on Equestria, countries like South Africa and Brazil revoke all the ponies' rights but the most basic ones, and begin rounding them up — regardless of their diplomatic status — and placing them in prison camps as menaces to public safety. Pony scientists stationed the Arctic <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">are given the chance to prove their loyalty to their human colleagues, and thus a few of them evade getting detained by the British Army</span>, which makes this principle of "preventive detention" seemingly more subjective than it generally should be.

A robot killing a human is "an industrial accident". On the other hand, if somebody reprogrammed the robot to kill a person, then that <em>would</em> be murder, though of course the programmer, rather than the robot itself, would be charged.

The ethics of killing "monsters" that are also sentient creatures in the Discworld is dealt with in several of its books. For instance, Granny Weatherwax insists on having an anthropomorphic wolf given a proper burial after it is killed at its own request. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is bringing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyTales">Fairy Tales</a> to life. In the fairy tale, the Big Bad Wolf behaves like a human, but it's okay to kill him like a wolf. By burying him as if he were human, Granny is fighting the story.

</li><li> Carrot, whose freeing of Dorfl started the golems' own peaceful self-liberation, and who once arrested a dragon. The golems are an interesting subversion in how the police behave. Vimes at one point is asked to arrest Dorfl for committing a murder which the golem was confessing to, but he knew was innocent. To get out of this, he deliberately invokes this trope, pointing out that, legally, golems aren't people and thus can't murder anyone, and if anything it's the golem's owner who's the murderer. The owner attempts to abandon his ownership of the golem, at which point Carrot points out he can't do that because it's littering. Carrot then buys Dorfl for a dollar and gives him to himself. Besides, if he owns the golem, which has no personhood, he should be liable for any crimes it commits. However, this exact predicament was avoided in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> by the law treating slaves or indentured servants as freemen if they did anything wrong.

Worried that the company that owns Jerry might decide to have him killed when he is no longer useful, she hires a law firm to have Jerry declared human. The law firm coaches Jerry on how to testify (it is technically illegal to coach witnesses, though almost impossible to prosecute). Jerry proves himself finally by singing a song to the judges in court. An episode of the short-lived <em>Masters of Science Fiction</em> TV series was based on this, but replaced the chimp with a genetically engineered humanoid formerly used to clear mine fields.

The aliens are quite obviously more technologically advanced than humanity, and could very well wipe out the entire planet if they decided to, so only the most radical humans oppose giving the suspect a fair trial. That said, there is some argument over whether an alien can be considered "sane" by human standards, and several times it's brought up that most people think of the aliens as interchangeable and identical rather than varied individuals. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It is eventually revealed that most of the aliens do not regard <em>humans</em> as having any rights, and planned to destroy us as a potential threat, which the alien suspect foiled.</span>

The clan of Cherijo's deceased Jorenian husband Kao Torin took a more direct approach and simply staged an armed assault on the courthouse to break her out; the Jorenian government broke off all diplomatic ties with the League afterward. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Joseph dies helping her escape at the climax of <em>Shockball</em>, and in <em>Rebel Ice</em> the Jorenians acquire sufficient leverage to force the League to drop their grievance and arbitrate an end to the war with the Hsktskt in the process.</span>

He got the werewolf off by demonstrating that under the circumstances, what she did was legally self-defense - and then has her arrested for a killing she committed that could not be justified on those grounds as she left the courthouse, establishing the necessary corollary, that non-human sentients are also subject to the same punishments under the law as humans when they commit crimes. A later story continues this trend by Jason having a man arrested for a crime committed <em>against</em> a werewolf.

<ul><li> The series explored this question a number of times, primarily with the android Data. In "Measure Of A Man", he is the subject of a hearing by a Starfleet JAG officer to determine his legal status: is he property or a person? The judge mentioned that they were "dancing around the basic issue: does Data have a soul?", which she concluded could not be proven or disproven, just as it could not proven or disproven for humans and other organic sentients. Later episodes on the topic featured Data defending the right of other artificial sentients to life and liberty, and the question of Data's rights as a "parent" when he creates his "daughter", Lal.
</li><li> This was done again with polymorphic tools called Exocomps that were proven to have gained low-level intelligence and were excellent problem-solvers.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> explored the rights of the holographic doctor, including his right to have a say in his treatment.
<ul><li> In one episode, rather than delete months of his memory (and personality), Janeway eventually allowed him to work through psychological problems that could have kept him out of Sickbay for weeks or even months-despite the risk this might pose to the crew. Janeway had initially decided to just reboot the Doc, but changed her mind upon talking to Seven of Nine. When Janeway pointed out that the Doc was more like a replicator than a human, Seven pointed out that she, too, being Borg, was composed of parts not unlike the replicator, and wondered whether Janeway would eventually override her free will as well.
</li><li> In one episode, the Doctor had written a novel and submitted a draft, pre-editing, that the publisher thought was delightfully salacious in the way it seemed to impugn the Voyager crew, and promptly started distributing. The Doctor sued to have it stopped; the publisher argued he couldn't sue because he wasn't a person. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">The Federation</a> quite sensibly has no desire to extend suffrage to an easily-replicated computer program that can be given whatever personality, desires and values the programmer wants it to have (not to mention have its Ethics directory deleted with a push of a button). For what it's worth, the final decision is a bit of a subversion of the usual outcome: the court decides that the Doctor is not legally a "person". However, in an instance of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaninglessVillainVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaninglessVillainVictory">Meaningless Villain Victory</a>, the court decides that while he does not qualify as a "person", he does qualify as an "artist", and therefore is granted ownership rights to his holonovel anyway.
</li><li> There have been instances of respecting non-Doctor holograms, though, such as Janeway putting the ship at risk to save the holographic town of Fair Haven. Except that the town's achievement of self-awareness was treated as a malfunction to be fixed-a malfunction specifically caused by running too long, the usual cause of sentient holograms.

<ul><li> Touched on in Season 4 with the Initiative's treatment of Oz the werewolf. They wanted to experiment on him despite the fact that he, unlike most of the demons and monsters they dealt with, had a legal existence as a person and a student.
</li><li> The robot thing comes up, weirdly, in <em>Buffy</em>, as well-there are three apparently-sentient androids in the series. The first is a serial killer they get rid of, but April-the-sexbot is treated as a mentally-disabled person unfairly created and discarded. The Buffybot has a long and storied career, and never achieves enough self-awareness to worry about her rights, but is definitely treated as capable of suffering. Not to mention the demon who was trapped in a book, accidentally scanned into the internet, and then had himself downloaded into a robot.
</li></ul></li><li> The same topic arose on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> with an organization that meets once a month to dine on werewolves—who are human 90% of the time and return to human form on death (which means they must be eaten alive)
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood">True Blood</a></em> where vampires have been legally declared citizens, more or less, in a not-even-remotely-veiled analog to the real-life homosexual rights movement ("God hates fangs").
<ul><li> <em>True Blood</em> also demonstrates the flip-side of this trope; namely, vampires do <em>not</em> consider themselves as equal to humans, but rather superior. In addition, the human justice system is nowhere near equipped to deal with them, and vampires in the show kill with relative impunity. One even torpedoes the in-universe constitutional amendment to grant vampires equal rights to marry, own property, etc. by killing a reporter on live television because he doesn't <em>want</em> to be equal.
</li><li> By Season 5, the governor of the state of Louisiana has essentially invalidated the citizenship and rights of all vampires within the state: vampires seen outside their homes at night are breaking a curfew set for them, and subject to being shot on sight by SWAT teams and arrested <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (really sent to a special lab where experiments are done on them)</span>. The show never mentions how <em>massively</em> unconstitutional such actions would be.
</li><li> Near the finale, Bill is told he's not able to leave someone else his estate, because as a vampire Louisiana law considers him to have legally died after he was turned and thus it goes to his nearest living kin. It <em>is</em> mentioned that this law's being challenged in court, but it'll take years for them to rule either way on whether it's constitutional.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted and subverted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>. A human is suing a Vree for damages resulting from the alleged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienAbduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienAbduction">kidnapping</a> of his grandfather. The plaintiff claims to have found proof in Vree records, while the Vree enters his plea in a language nobody in the court understands forcing them to recess and find an interpreter. We never hear how it ends.
</li><li> Comes up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em>, unsurprisingly. "A Human Reaction" reveals that John thinks his alien shipmates would suffer from this sort of treatment if they ever made it back to Earth. Subverted when they do get back in "Terra Firma"; the aliens are treated like celebrities, put up in a beautiful mansion, provided with all the material goods they want... though they are still prisoners. Things may have gone differently if John's dad hadn't been part of the team that discovered Moya. It couldn't have hurt that the humanish-looking Sikozu made first contact and could speak English (and the terrifying Scorpius was not onboard).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008">Merlin (2008)</a></em> "practicing sorcery" is a capital crime. However since people are born with sorcerous abilities and can use them instinctively without contemplated intent, it is tantamount to outlawing sneezing or having a patellar reflex, so humans with sorcerous abilities are treated pretty much like a criminal subspecies.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EarthFinalConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EarthFinalConflict">Earth: Final Conflict</a></em> revolves around a murder trial in which the defendant is a Taelon who kills a former soldier in what appears to be self-defense. The Taelons are determined to keep the trial as human as possible in order to show that they're willing to abide by human rules and even request that Zo'or be put on the jury as a "peer". In fact, Zo'or does everything he can to convince the jury that the defendant is guilty of murder, even though the hospital video is clearly showing the soldier pulling a gun on him. Technically, this is not allowed, as new evidence (e.g. that Taelons are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings">Energy Beings</a> and cannot be harmed by bullets) cannot be introduced while the jury is deliberating. Zo'or wants to get the other Taelon convicted and punished (preferably by execution) to further his political goals. Then Boone manages to convince the judge to overturn the verdict and let the defendant go. The Taelon ends up killing himself at Zo'or's orders.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014">The Flash (2014)</a></em> has this happen to the metahumans (who are technically just humans who've gained special abilities): when Barry &amp; co. catch one who has broken the law, they simply lock them up in a secret makeshift prison without trial. This example is a lot more understandable than most, as the metahumans are far too dangerous for any normal prison and any attempt to put them on trial would only put innocent lives at risk. Later when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade">the masquerade</a> is lifted, they're sent to prison with special cells to confine them. No-one mentions that Barry &amp; co could be prosecuted and/or sued for false imprisonment after it's revealed. Luckily, there is now a metahuman wing in Iron Heights so metahuman criminals can be judged with due process. General Eiling never faced any kind of legal penalties for his experiments on Metahuman Bette San Souci (nor for her murder) or the abduction of Martin Stein. He also repeatedly referred to Bette as " his asset" rather than as a person.

They enslaved or slaughtered most others and when their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Spelljammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Spelljammer">spelljamming</a> exploration began they started to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWouldCutYouUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWouldCutYouUp">vivisect</a> anything they ran across. Naturally, soon the Netherese were treated much the same way as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainFood">Illithids</a>, and attempts of more sane mages to fix this reputation mostly failed. The net result was that with their ships attacked on sight Netheril has no trade partners and the defense grew so expensive that in a hundred years from the first lift-off they were forced to abandon space travel altogether, uber-wizards or not.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em>, it is mentioned that monster races rarely receive the full rights of the more humanoid races. This causes trouble in parts of Breland (especially Sharn), where if a gnoll kills someone, it's murder — but the opposite is not true. The question of warforged rights have been a knotty tangle in the Five Nations. Legally, all signatories to the treaties that ended the Last War have to recognize them as autonomous persons, but in practice Thrane is known for keeping warforged in indentured servitude and many people in other nations are strongly prejudiced against them. Karrnath, meanwhile, also keeps legions of intelligent undead in storage much like other nations packed away weapons and armor.

While VALKYRIE engages in wetwork, they usually do so only after assessing that the supernatural population in question is a threat.

</li><li> The antagonist faction of the mages in the same setting, the Seers of the Throne, tend to control mortal governments just as thoroughly as their own shadow governments and trend toward situations where this is an issue. Their precursors in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">Old World of Darkness</a>, the Technocracy, _were_ the government and were basically mired in these issues at any time that a supernatural being other than a tradition mage was involved (tradition mages, of course, were pretty much kill on sight if the technocrat in question could get away with it). Heck, back in the day, the Technocracy would regularly conduct pogroms — and they were <em>explicitly</em> called Pogroms — to rout out any group of supernaturals, mage or otherwise, who could threaten consensus. They've fallen out of favor, but they still have their advocates...
</li></ul></li><li> How non-humans are treated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts">Rifts</a></em> by the Coalition States. Mages have no rights at all (even if it's involuntary like a Mystic), psychics' are limited (second-class citizens who must be implanted with trackers), and Dog Boys have barely more than pets.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HeroesUnlimited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HeroesUnlimited">Heroes Unlimited</a></em> universe (including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesAndOtherStrangeness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesAndOtherStrangeness">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles &amp; Other Strangeness</a></em>), technology has outpaced the law, and mutant humans and animals can be legally treated as property and experimented on without any rights of any kind. This isn't a conscious development; rather, it's because there's a dearth of test cases before the courts, and the biotech companies and government black projects don't let their property <em>get</em> that far. Known superheroes are largely exempt from this and treated as human beings, but developing a legal public identity can be a real trick if your creator has declared you a public menace. The sourcebook <em>Mutants Underground</em> goes into this in more detail.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WitchGirlsAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WitchGirlsAdventures">Witch Girls Adventures</a></em>, witches (as well as otherkin such as the Fae, Immortals, and Nightlings such as Vampires or Shape Shifters) are a separate species from humans (although they can interbreed, the traits appear to be recessive at least with Witches, which muddies the waters) which probably leads to how organizations such as Malleus Maleficarum treat them with an 'execute on sight' policy or how the Arbus Society views them as aliens from outer space who lack privacy rights.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planescape</a></em>, the ruling authorities of Sigil generally look down upon some human or demihuman adventurer treating the city like their own personal dungeon crawl, given all the "monstrous" citizens. After all, that goblin you just stabbed might be a respected member of a powerful faction, or at least pays his taxes. You're more likely to have your rights trampled for belonging to the wrong faction when the city guard passes on patrol. Outside Sigil, it all depends on the local climate.
</li><li> Metahumans and the Awakened in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> have had an uphill battle for civil rights that would have been a non-issue if they hadn't expressed. Most civilized countries have decided that they share the same rights as their non-magical, non-metahuman peers. The newest group to suffer like this are technomancers, outwardly normal people who can interact with the Matrix without technology and do things with code that leave the most elite hackers scratching their heads.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>:
<ul><li> Because Humans have been subjugated and treated horribly by aliens in the past, they had a policy which stated that hostile species be suppressed, though that was later bastardized to a general zero-tolerance policy. The anthropocentric Imperium of Man, as a rule of thumb, will work to actively work to exterminate aliens. As a few notable alien species have proven, if they may prove to be useful to the Imperium through any unique talents (like the Jokaero), then agents of the Imperium will try to subjugate and exploit them instead.
</li><li> In a few certain cases, the Imperium will have to practice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Realpolitik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Realpolitik">Realpolitik</a> if the only other options are poorer. The Tau, for example, have a growing empire in a region of space Humanity has dwindling resources and increasing enemies in, so they're letting the Tau defend that area while both sides are engaged in Cold War, trading territory and occasional blows. Other times, Humanity will reluctantly ally with the Eldar if a greater mutual threat presents itself.
</li><li> The Imperium also has a varying level of tolerance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mutant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mutant">Mutants</a> that varies world-to-world, ranging from second-class citizens to "kill on sight". Any that tolerates the Mutants probably will use them as a source of disposable labor in harsh conditions and next to no pay. Humanity also tend to look down on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSubspecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSubspecies">Abhumans</a>, but they tend to be lucky enough to run their own worlds (if they're smart enough to do so) and can serve in the military.
</li><li> Within the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">Tau empire</a>, it's ultimately ambiguous if all citizens share the same rights, or if the Tau have greater rights than other species. On one hand, they have the highest general standard of living, but they're also maybe-controlled by the highest Caste of the Tau.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BaseRaiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BaseRaiders">Base Raiders</a></em> none of the assorted aliens, supernatural beings, or even humans from alternate universes scattered throughout the post-superhero world have human rights. Natural mutants (so long as they don't look too inhuman) are considered human though. And acquiring superpowers is a crime. All things considered, this tends to lead a lot of sophonts into organized crime, such as baseraiding.

But in the <em>Alien Crossfire</em> expansion, nobody bats an eyelash if you use the nerve gas on the Progenitor (non-human) factions (still, the Progenitor factions feel the same way toward humans, so this may explain things).
<ul><li> The "rules of war" in SMAC are a mutually agreed upon set of regulations that can be disbanded by 67% majority vote. The Progenitors have never signed the treaty and therefore do not fall under its protection. Additionally, most CPU factions will push to remove the regulations if they ever think it will benefit them.
<ul><li> Additionally, you can vote to initiate global warming/cooling in order to raise/lower the sea levels. Nobody bothers to ask if the Progenitors are ok with this.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris">Stellaris</a></em>, this is what combining Xenophobe and Egalitarian ethos leads to. Such a civilization grants all the rights of a modern democracy and great or utopian living standards to their own species, but any filthy xenos on planets they conquer are chased off, enslaved, targeted for genocide, or simply <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SapientEatSapient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SapientEatSapient">eaten</a></em>.

<ul><li> The rights of non-humans are an important theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Freefall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Freefall">Freefall</a></em>, with a squid-like alien protagonist, an anthropomorphic, intelligent, genetically engineered wolf who is technically still property, and a host of apparently sentient robots struggling with or ignoring the three robotics laws. In one story arc, robots have been dismantled against their will by other robots. As Sam asks: is this a crime or simply overly aggressive recycling? (Cue the Ironic Echo two strips later.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DanAndMabsFurryAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DanAndMabsFurryAdventures">Dan and Mab's Furry Adventures</a></em>, there are several races of people, some of which are about as tough as a normal human, and others which are extremely powerful and long-lived. When someone commits a crime against a member of another race, he's judged and sentenced by members of his own race, which may lead to a sentence of community service for a murder conviction in more extreme cases. This leads to a lot of vigilante justice in the form of "adventuring".
</li><li> The Nai'ka in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ThisIsTheWorstIdeaYouveEverHad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ThisIsTheWorstIdeaYouveEverHad">This Is the Worst Idea You've Ever Had!</a></em> are given animal rights instead of human rights. One of the main plotlines of Chapter Two demonstrates that if you were to kill a Nai'ka (which is a common occurrence, as their blood can act as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug">Fantastic Drug</a> that can allow humans to use magic for a brief time), it would be considered animal abuse instead of homicide, and the police really won't treat the matter with any kind of respect, nor is it a priority of theirs. Made even worse by the fact that many Nai'ka are quite naive, and therefore easy to exploit. The spin-off comic <em>Sin Pararse</em> shows an even darker side to this trope with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rei, who was found in a brothel and was implied to have been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">Sex Slave</a> for nearly a decade</span>.

<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/LegalRightsOfETs.htm">This article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> discusses the issue of legal rights for aliens in some detail. Turns out it's really not that straightforward. Though the last paragraph is of note and simplifies things:
<div class="indent">As a last resort (in my view the wiser course), Congress may decide to entirely junk the above anthropocentric pigeonholes [i.e. the bulk of the multi-page essay]. A new legal classification might be created — the "extraterrestrial person" or "pseudoperson" — which grants the ET a measure of rights and responsibilities in keeping with the basic principles of Metalaw. At long last, jus naturale, galactic conscience and universal equity may find a home in American jurisprudence.
</div></li><li> In most common law countries (essentially countries where English is the first language, and other former British colonies) corporations are given the same rights as "natural persons". American corporations even have free speech rights. In Great Britain, they can be tried for negligent homicide. Should we meet aliens tomorrow, the Supreme Court is very likely going to interpret "person" as "sapient creature".
</li><li> If <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nix_v._Hedden">Nix v. Hedden<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is any indication, the scientific designation means nothing to the U.S. Supreme Court. Nix v. Hedden deals with the legal classification of a plant (specifically, tomatoes) for tax purposes and was decided years before Plessey v. Ferguson (which allowed "separate but equal"). Those are 19th century cases. Brown v. Board of Education makes it pretty clear that race discrimination violates the US Constitution while Obergefell v. Hodges (gay marriage) reinforces an earlier Supreme Court ruling (Loving v. Virginia) about how marriage is a fundamental right.
</li><li> There is also an emerging body of law concerning the legal rights of animals.
<ul><li> Some African nations, determined to protect their dwindling gorilla or chimp populations, have considered declaring the poaching of these animals as murder.
</li><li> In 1993 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardDawkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardDawkins">Richard Dawkins</a> among others signed a petition for great apes to be declared persons, and a Brazilian court ruled they were. The issue is likely to come up again.
</li><li> India has declared dolphins as non-human persons; it's illegal to confine them or keep them in captivity, as well as other cetaceans.
</li></ul></li><li> The United States Copyright Office has stated that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/09/copyright-law-supernatural-beings-monkey-selfie">supernatural beings cannot hold copyrights<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. If vampires are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealAfterAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealAfterAll">Real After All</a>, this would be a very dangerous precedent for them. No doubt there would be much quibbling over what "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer">supernatural</a>" means. Law as written, must be "fruits of an intellectual labor" and human could be argued as a catch all should a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Klingon</a> want residuals for his Opera should said Opera be honestly created by an alien life form.
</li><li> In Canada, believe it or not, there is actual case law about this. In an Ontario Superior Court case named <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joly_v_Pelletier">Joly v. Pelletier<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, Joly sued a wide variety of private, government, and foreign parties for discriminating against him on the grounds that he was a Martian. In an admirably deadpan decision, the judge ruled that, since only persons and corporations have standing to sue, and a person is "an individual human being," then, since Joly's whole argument was that he wasn't a human being, his suit had to fail. As a result, there is actual legal precedent that extraterrestrials have no standing to sue... at least in Ontario.
</li><li> Of course, in U.S. Law, you must have standing to go to trial. The courts won't rule on a hypothetical situation and since "human rights" covers all individuals known to the court system, no one has standing to challenge them as an alien from another world.
</li><li> Brazil, which has a big U.F.O culture, has declared that any extra terrestrials landing in Brazil would be given full human rights. This fact gets a bit jarring when we consider that Brazil doesn't have much of a human rights tradition...
</li><li> In some legal systems, deities actually held legal personhood, mainly for the purpose to own property related to worship, since coporate personhood wasn't widely accepted until the modern times.
<ul><li> In Germanic tribes, deities were held to be legal persons to whom the property of their temple was vested, their priests being their tutors. This survived <a class="urllink" href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12466a.htm">even during Christianisation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: in the <em>Domesday Book</em>, lands owned by churches was noted to be owned by the saint or the angel they were consecrated to.
</li><li> Some Muslims scholars from the Shafiʽi school, later joined by the Hanafi school, held <em>waqf</em> was actually owned by Allah upon its consecration.
</li><li> Even today, in India, <a class="urllink" href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ayodhya-title-suit-lord-ram-the-lord-as-a-juristic-person-what-legal-rights-do-deities-enjoy-6052442/">idols of Hindu temples are held to be legal persons<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, able to own their temples, pay taxes and be sued. Their guardians, or <em>shebait</em>, are most often their priest. One of the arguments presented against allowing women of menstruating age entry into a temple was that this would violate the right to privacy of Lord Ayyappa, who is eternally celibate; this argument was rejected because legal persons haven't necessarily constitutional rights.
</li></ul></li><li> In some places, alive persons could be declarated to be civilly dead, as a result of penal convictions, religious profession in a monastery or any condition which could make participation to civil life impossible. <a class="urllink" href="https://ccresourcecenter.org/2018/06/07/civil-death-lives/">Even today<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Rhode Island and New York allow for civil death for life convicts.
