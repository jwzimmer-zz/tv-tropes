Alucard was in his mid-forties when he died (just like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> Dracula), but has the appearance of a man in his twenties <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeShifterDefaultForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeShifterDefaultForm">because he is powerful enough to assume pretty much any form he wants.</a> When his full power is unlocked, he resumes his original appearance (complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassMustache" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassMustache">mustache</a>), but quickly resumes his usual form (and later the form of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">fourteen-year old girl</a>).

Barring accident or illness they live to between 200 to 250 years. From birth to 15 they age at more or less the same rate as a normal human. From 15 to 25 years their maturation slows until they're at a point somewhat equivalent to a lander at age 20 at which point they only age very, <em>very</em> slowly.
</li><li> <em>New <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CuteyHoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CuteyHoney">Cutey Honey</a></em> takes place about a hundred years after the original series, but Honey only looks a few years older . . . of course, given that she's an android, the fact that she's aged at all is surprising. Possibly justified in that she's a shapeshifter, and may have used her powers to age until her teen years were behind her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em> it is shown that the Nation-tans age as children, but are usually stuck at 20 or so.

Presumably their aging slows down gradually instead of at an instant.
</li><li> Black Mage Zeref from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> was still a young man in his late teens/early twenties when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his refusal to stop researching ways to revive the dead finally incurred the wrath of Ankhseram, the deity that governs life and death</span>.

Rukia and Renji are implied to grow from children to young adults in a roughly normal amount of time, but then don't age at all over the next fifty years. The epilogue, which takes place tens years after the series shows <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">their daughter</span> who looks to be about eight or nine years old. On the other hand, Toshiro looks like he's twelve and doesn't age at all for over thirty years.

Mark's half-brother, Oliver, may fit this trope even more, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his mother's race have exceptionally short life-spans, causing Oliver to age rapidly into a teenager in less than one Earth year, at which point his Viltrumite heritage kicks in and slows his aging process to a crawl</span>.
</li><li> Jenny Sparks from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAuthority">The Authority</a></em> stopped aging at 19 and remained that way for the remainder of the 20th century. Probably applies to some of the other "century babies" too but some of them at least appear older.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Planetary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Planetary">Planetary</a></em>, main protagonist Elijah Snow is a Century Baby, human beings born at the exact moment a new century is ushered in (in Snow's case, midnight of January 1, 1900) and possess supernatural abilities, near-immortality being one of them. At the start of the series, Snow is nearly a hundred years old but appears to be in his mid-30s. While she is not a Century Baby, Planetary operative Jakita Wagner is over 60 years old yet looks no older than 30. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It turns out her abilities are the result of her being the daughter of a Century Baby whom Snow knew. The children of Century Babies also possess nigh-immortality in addition to various other superpowers.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> aged normally until sometime during his prime, when his aging slowed down significantly. Stories set a couple hundred years in the future often show him looking like a normal person would at 50 or 60.
</li><li> The rather obscure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ClanDestine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ClanDestine">ClanDestine</a> of Marvel has this in spades. It's not true immortality, as some of them age - just very slowly. The clan patriarch hasn't aged a day since the 12th century.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>: The comics have gone back and forth on whether Kryptonians are immortal but no matter how slowly they age in adulthood, they always age normally up to about their mid twenties to early thirties.
</li><li> Averted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePantheon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePantheon">Pantheon leader Agamemnon</a>. Although he likes appearing to people in the holographic form of a very old man with a long white beard, his immortality kicked in when he was 16. Played straight with his descendants the Pantheon, who all had their immortality hit as young adults.
</li><li> Members of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DeathVigil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DeathVigil">Death Vigil</a></em> are locked at the age they died, hence James being called "kid" despite having been in the vigil longer than Sam.
</li><li> It's explicitly mentioned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest">ElfQuest</a></em> that elf children grow up quickly and spend an eternity being physically mature. This applies to the Wolfriders as well, who are technically mortal but can easily live 800 years anyway. It does take male elves about 500 years to grow a beard though.
</li><li> Martians in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WarlordOfMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WarlordOfMars">Warlord of Mars</a></em> are very immortal, or at very least age slowly after reaching physical maturity. The female lead Dejah Thoris, is at least 400 years old by the time she meets John Carter, with the prequel series that she starred taking many centuries before their meeting, yet she is physically in her early twenties. A few exceptions exist with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOldFolks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOldFolks">Issus</a> and Tardos Mors, who clearly show signs of aging, but its possible that they are <em>really that old</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a></em>:

The three of them would be nearly immortal, to ensure that the Universe would have three guardians of their caliber for as long as possible. <br/>The big drawback was that they stayed kids. <br/>Shazam had admitted once that, if they wanted, he could remove that factor from them and they would age normally. But he had no idea how it would affect their powers in their other bodies. None of them had opted to age, as a result. <br/>Mary and Freddy had been wanting to get serious for years.

<ul><li> Played with in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InTime">In Time</a></em>. People are genetically engineered to stop aging at age 25, and continue to look the same until their time - which has become the new currency - runs out and they drop dead on the spot. At one point, Vincent Kartheiser's character introduces his wife, daughter and mother-in-law, all of whom look around the same age. It's also possible to kill yourself through, say, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> alcohol poisoning</span> even if you still have years left.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekInsurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekInsurrection">Star Trek: Insurrection</a></em>, the magic radiation produced by the planet's rings takes some time to stop/slow the aging process. So when Picard asks a young boy if he's really 75 he's told "no, I'm twelve." It also works in reverse returning people middle aged or older to their physical prime upon arriving to the planet. One of the townsfolk who looks 30ish or so mentions they were an old man when they'd first arrived, and in fact nobody in town looks older than 40 or so. Picard himself becomes notably more spry and energetic after being in the system for a while though he doesn't stay long enough to have a visable affect on his age.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManFromEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManFromEarth">The Man from Earth</a></em> appears to be about 33, the logic being that this is when humans reach full maturity (and aging after that is just decay).
</li><li> While it's not specified, it's clear that this is partly the case in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Underworld2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Underworld2003">Underworld (2003)</a></em> films.

Those who are born vampire/lycan, however, grow normally until physical maturity, at which point they stop aging. This is why both Viktor (a vampire elder) and Alexander Corvinus (the first immortal) are old, as they became immortal later in their lives.

<ul><li> Wizards age much slower than normal humans, with the oldest members of the cast reaching into multiple centuries. They age normally through childhood and adolescence, with their physical aging seeming to slow down somewhere between their twenties and thirties. Old wizards do end up looking old, though a 200 year old wizard will only appear to be in their 70s.
</li><li> The extensive cast list gives way to a great number of variances of this trope. Deirdre, a roughly 1500 year old host to a fallen angel, appears to only be in her teens, while her father, one of the oldest men in existence, has the appearance of a man barely entering middle age. Some younger members of their cult, while still immortal, look to be much older physically than their leaders.

</li><li> Subverted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanMcDonald" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanMcDonald">Ian McDonald</a>'s <em>River of Gods</em> - one of the many enhancements given to the so-called "Brahman Babies" is a doubled lifespan. They age half as fast physically, but mentally (or at least legally) grow up at a more-or-less normal pace, leading to apparently ten-year-old night-club owners. A short story set in the same universe points out the rather nasty effect this has on marriages.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera">Dragaera</a> definitely uses this. Dragaerans are immature from about ages 1-70, but are still in fighting shape after 1,000 years. They do get old eventually, but the series is remarkably low on infirm, elderly Dragaerans, so it's not clear how long they last as "old people".

After that, they seem to play the trope straight, appearing young and beautiful for millennia, but they <em>are</em> still aging, just proportionally slowly given that their lifespans are potentially as long as <em>the remaining lifespan of the universe</em>. The oldest elves <em>do</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">show signs of aging</a>, such as Círdan the Shipwright, who at the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> has a long white beard, which he earned by being <em>over seven thousand years old</em>, i.e. <em><strong>he's as old as the existence of the elvish race</strong></em>.
</li><li> Numenoreans, at least the nobility, live two or three times as long as ordinary humans, but remain in their prime for most of it, and then will go suddenly from that to senile decrepitude in a matter of months or even weeks. At the first sign, they hand over their affairs to their children and prepare to receive the Gift of Eru (which lesser men call Death)—or at least, they were <em>supposed</em> to do that. When they stopped, <em>that</em> is when the trouble began...
</li><li> The hobbits, on the other hand, avert this: they live longer than normal humans, but also reach adulthood later (in their thirties—specifically, at thirty-three). For example, Pippin, 29, is treated like a teenager (albeit an older one—more like an 18-year-old than, say, a 15-year-old) and certainly acts as such.

Once they join they no longer age. All of the hunters are said to look in their late adolescent and teen years. Artemis says she could appear as anything she wants but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFormYouAreComfortableWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFormYouAreComfortableWith">she prefers appearing the same age as her hunters</a>.

</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Duumvirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Duumvirate">Duumvirate</a></em>, where it's referred to as "maximum age".
</li><li> A science fiction story called <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.benjaminrosenbaum.com/stories/start.the.clock.html">Start The Clock,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> by Benjamin Rosenbaum, was all about the results of averting this trope. An ill-defined plague stopped everybody aging (and apparently gave immortality as a side-effect). The worst-hit group seem to be the teenagers, since their hormone overproduction <em>didn't stop</em>, turning most into what amounts to bunch of sex-mad orcs.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em>:
<ul><li> Human/vampire hybrids <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidAging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidAging">age to 17 years old in only seven years</a>, then their aging stops. This is the case with Renesmee, who ages to a little girl in a few months, as well as Nahuel, a hybrid who is about 150 years old.
</li><li> Vampires technically avert this, as humans can be turned in any age, from babies all the way to elders. Still, the vast majority of vampires in the series are young adult beauties, which invokes this trope. It isn't until <em>Breaking Dawn</em> that non-young adult vampires (immortal children; infant or toddler vampires) are discussed, and then only in backstory.
</li></ul></li><li> The dragons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle">Inheritance Cycle</a></em> grow up within a few years, despite having very long lifespans. This is taken to the logical extreme in film, where Saphira transforms from an infant to adult in a literal second.
<ul><li> Dragons reach maturity at around six months, when they're able to breathe fire, but they never stop actually growing. The largest dragons can dwarf an aircraft carrier, and they end up sleeping most of the time and living in their dreams in order to preserve their energy.
</li><li> Dragon Riders age considerably slower, but the exact details and rules around are very nebulous. Oromis lived for several hundred years and while he <em>looks</em> old, he doesn't have any normal signs of aging, e.g. wrinkles. Meanwhile, Brom and Galbatorix have been around for roughly the same amount of time - over a century - and lost their dragons, but Brom looks like a regular old man and Galbatorix looks to be in his 40s. Normal elves, meanwhile, also age very slowly due to their race's magical binding to dragons, and can live for hundreds, if not thousands of years without aging. The one exception might be Rhunon, but she is old even by <em>their</em> standards; old enough to know about life before the Riders, and bending over a forge for several thousand years can give you a bad posture.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad">The Belgariad</a></em>
<ul><li> Sorcerers appear to be immortal. They are humans who grow up normally but, once they hit adulthood, they stop ageing. While they retain youthful vigor, Belgarath theorises that physical appearance will depend on the attitude of each individual sorcerer, who make a subconscious decision to conform their appearance to the prejudices and stereotypes of human society. As a result, because humans tend to assume old men are wise and old women are ugly crones, the male sorcerers tend to appear as old men and the female sorcerers tend to appear as young, beautiful women.
</li><li> Ce'Nedra has Dryad ancestry. She initially grows up at the same speed as a normal human so when she and Garion first meet, they are both fifteen years old. Dryads live for as long as the tree they are bonded to, so Ce'Nedra's cousins are hundreds of years old even though they look young women. Both the Gods and the Prophecy hate the inequality of love-matches where one partner is immortal and one mortal, even if they have to turn a mortal into an immortal sorcerer to ensure such equality happens. Once she reaches adulthood, it's strongly implied that Ce'Nedra will now age at the speed of a Dryad instead of a human, which is why she is destined to become the wife of the immortal sorcerer, Garion.
</li></ul></li><li> Done in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCompanyNovels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCompanyNovels">The Company Novels</a></em>, where the immortals go through the immortality process from pretty much birth to age 18 and then stop aging. They have to use makeup in order to look like they are still doing so.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MercyThompson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MercyThompson">Mercy Thompson</a></em> books, all werewolves look to be in their early or mid-twenties, no matter old they were when they were turned (either continuing to mature if they were children, or reverting to the appearance of youth if they were past their prime). The only naturally born werewolf stopped aging in his mid-twenties, as well. This is stated to be part of their healing and disease resistance magic.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGuardiansOfTimeTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGuardiansOfTimeTrilogy">The Guardians of Time Trilogy</a></em>.
</li><li> In Joanna Bertin's Dragonlords trilogy, Dragonlords are humans born among humans but utterly sterile, birth marked, and with half-dragon souls; at some point these dragon souls manifest and the Dragonlord is stronger and more magical than most humans as well as able to transform into a dragon, and from that point on they age incredibly slowly. Typically they manifest in the twenties or thirties. In <em>The Last Dragonlord</em>, the Dragonlord mentioned in the title is also called "Little One" because he's the youngest, at six hundred years old. Their leader manifested unusually young, at sixteen, and by this point is visibly old. The little one wonders about just how long she's been alive but doesn't ask.
</li><li> Conrad Nomikos, the main character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThisImmortal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThisImmortal">This Immortal</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerZelazny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerZelazny">Roger Zelazny</a> (if the title didn't tip you off, you haven't read enough of this website) looks 23.

Ward's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BlackDaggerBrotherhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BlackDaggerBrotherhood">Black Dagger Brotherhood</a></em> series, vampires live for hundreds of years. Their transition from "pre-trans" to full vampire occurs at about 25, and they age very slowly after that.
</li><li> Both played straight and subverted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TrudiCanavan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TrudiCanavan">Trudi Canavan</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAgeOfTheFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAgeOfTheFive">The Age of the Five</a></em> trilogy: whilst the White and the Voices stop aging when they are 'chosen' by their respective gods, The Wilds (powerful sorcerers who develop immortality naturally) generally cease to age at the point when they discover the secret. Whilst most of the Wilds are older than twenty when this happens, due to the full emergence of their powers generally happening after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PubertySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PubertySuperpower">puberty</a>, one of the Wilds <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Gull, who is the oldest surviving immortal,</span> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">several thousand years old</a>, but has the body of a child of seven or eight.

As a side effect, it makes them "ageless" (essentially, wrinkle-free). It also cuts their lifespans in half, which they don't know until they meet wrinkled (though not ancient-looking) channelers who are over 400 years old. It also causes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">Uncanny Valley</a> effect in the eyes, since these apparently continue to age, even if the skin around them doesn't.
</li><li> Inverted in Sean McMullen's ''Voyage of the Shadowmoon", wherein Laron is a perpetually 14-year-old vampyre. With acne and a stuck-on beard. It sucks.
</li><li> Inverted in <em>The Meq</em>. The Meq attain immortality at 12 and lose it when they are ready to mate.
</li><li> In Kim Harrison's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHollows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHollows">The Hollows</a></em> it is implied that witches grow up like humans and age little for about a century after they reach their twenties, resulting in a natural life span of about 160.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em>, prolong recipients are "frozen" at a different age range depending on which version of the treatment they got: mid-forties for 1st, late 20s for second, and early 20s for 3rd. The freeze extends lifespan to the two to three century mark. It also has the effect of extending stages of development; Honor Harrington herself was a bit of an awkward adolescent, gangly and horse-faced, until at least well into her 30s. Such treatments are new enough during the period when most published stories are set that we don't actually get to <em>see</em> any characters who are 250 years old but look "only" 65 or so, but first- and second-generation recipients of the Prolong treatments do seem to get a prolonged middle age as well as the usual prolonged young adulthood.
<ul><li> In "Echoes of Honor" we find out that it also extends non-visible aspects of those same periods. Honor's mother, a second-generation prolong recipient, is about 100 years old but has the body of a woman in her thirties... complete with the ability to still bear children. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the wake of Honor's "death", this is exploited to resolve the issue of succession in Harrington Steading, by having her parents produce a sibling for her.</span>
</li><li> This was subject to a retcon mid-way through the series. In earlier books, Prolong prolonged <em>all</em> stages of development, so that a bridge crewed by 20-something graduates of the naval academy looked more like a middle school class, which characters from worlds without prolong found disturbing. Later, however, it's said that children receive additional treatments so they develop up to their 20s at a more normal rate.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a>: the retcon came after several mentions that crew on ships had mandatory birth control implants because, in a mixed-gender environment, sex between crewmembers would be impossible to prevent and was officially tolerated within limits. This, combined with younger crewmembers looking like very young teens or even prepubescents, raised obvious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a>.

Most people tend to do it in their early 20s, although some choose to wait until they're 30 to give themselves a more "mature" look. Since the treatment is not genetic, it doesn't affect children born of CR-treated people. The treatment is reversible, but this is only done to criminals sentenced to Aging. Interestingly, youthful looks are a moot point in the novel, as "biosculpting" has allowed people to "mold" their features to any they wish. This has resulted in worlds filled with women who look roughly the same (with main differences being hair and eye colors). The titular protagonist's choice of his next wife is partly guided by the fact that he finds a stunning beauty who doesn't look like she's been biosculpted. French himself gets weird looks from many people, since he looks to be visibly in his 50s and even has some grey hairs (most people don't even know there's such a thing as grey hair). He got the CR treatment late in his life, as it didn't exist when he was born (21st century)

This helps with population control, but they lose out on experiences only adults or the elderly can have ... except the title character, a brilliant artist whose loss of immortality is reflected in his work.

</li><li> Also Claire.
</li><li> For Sylar, though, it's justified- he acquired his powers of unaging-ness when he (or the actor playing him) was in his twenties, so it makes sense that that's the age he'd stick at.

While they (presumably) grow up at a normal rate compared with regular old humans, once they reach maturity they seem to be capable of staying this way for a very, very long time (millions of years if they happen to be encased in ice, as was seen in one episode... though there was limited degeneration, the Ancient in question was still perfectly able to walk, think, and understand modern humans).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander">Highlander</a>: The Series</em> both averts and explains this. Immortals are always frozen at the age when they first died, so you can get child immortals, but because immortals also tend to hunt each other down, the children don't last long, so you don't see many... the ones that survive the first few years... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">tend to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">be off</a>. Immortals above the biological age of forty also tend to be rare, for pretty much the same reason - those that aren't 'lucky' enough to start being immortal when in their physical prime (20s and 30s) are less likely to last long when other immortals come around with a sword and try to cut their heads off.
<ul><li> Interestingly, the novelization of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Highlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Highlander">the original film</a> appears to indicate this trope originally being played even straighter, with the immortality simply kicking in at a certain age and aging stopping. However, that never made it into onscreen canon of the film. It's possible the book was created from an earlier script, before stuff had to be cut for time or whatever.
<ul><li> Actually, the film makes it apparent that Connor is already considered immortal at the time of the battle where he "died". The Kurgan was clearly trying to take his head and Connor felt The Kurgan's presence. Neither of these are possible for pre-immortals in later canon. The film also has Connor be able to survive underwater without problems. It's only later that the idea that they still die like everyone else and then come back to life is introduced.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em> fits this trope to the letter as later teens/early twenties is the usual age range of the lead characters.

<ul><li> In the Fourth Edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>, races that have lifespans greater than that of a human (for example, eladrin) follow this trope, maturing normally until around the age of twenty and staying like that for the majority of their lifespans. Previous editions gave the age at which they reached "adulthood" but no indication of the rate of maturity (which led to questions like, "is a one-hundred-and-ten-year old elf as emotionally mature as a fifteen-year old human?" and "is it wrong to bang an eighty-year old elf?")
<ul><li> Quite a few sources prior to 4th have suggested that elven infants mature fast enough that elves probably aren't in diapers for twenty years, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick">The Order of the Stick</a></em> not withstanding. It's not so much that elves take about a century to look like an adult so much as that elven culture doesn't really consider someone an "adult" until they've been living in elven society for about that long. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLegendOfDrizzt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLegendOfDrizzt">Drizzt Do'Urden</a> is a notable example, in that he was about 35 when he was exiled from his homeland and about 49 when he made his first appearance, yet appeared to be no younger than a teenager and no older than thirty throughout.
</li><li> Averted for half dragons (in some versions), who may not have left adolescence by the time others have died of old age. This is in line with dragon aging, where being 50 is the equivalent of the late teens and 100 is adulthood.
</li><li> Kobolds have an odd version of this. They grow and age at about ten times the speed of dragons, meaning a kobold is basically fully-grown at five and physically and emotionally mature at ten. After that, though, they age incredibly slowly, with them not being weakened by age until their sixties and not dying of old age until they're double that or beyond (and dragonwrought kobolds can make it to their 200s). This is equivalent to dragons, which only stop growing at the age of 1200. However, few kobolds actually live this long, given their status as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoomba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoomba">The Goomba</a>; a "great wyrm" kobold is either incredibly dangerous or incredibly lucky.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em> each level of Extended Lifespan doubles the amount of time spent maturing. However, Fast Maturation is available as a zero point ability with each level cutting time to mature by half causing the character to spend that much more time at their prime.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>, Exalts (who may live anywhere from a few centuries to a few millenia, or even eternally depending on type) stop visibly aging until the very end of their extraordinarily long lifetimes. Since the average age of exaltation ranges from late teens to mid-thirties (there are exceptions of course. The youngest exalt was a preteen and still is after 1500ish years, while one of the oldest to exalt was over 60), they somewhat fit within this trope.
<ul><li> Also, the Terrestrial Exalted age more continuously and gradually over the centuries (or else their Exaltations would leave a good number of them as semi-eternal children), but do not move past their (physical) fifties or so until their lifespan draws close to an end. Since they always exalt before the age of 20, the rule for them seems to be normal aging until reaching full physical maturity (i.e. early 20s) before it slows down.
<ul><li> Solars, Lunars, and Sidereals who exalt as teenagers may follow a similar rule. The 1500 year old preteen mentioned above has spent far too much time in the Wyld and is quite messed up. The others which aren't clearly adults in the artwork are all very young and inexperienced.
</li></ul></li><li> Strangely enforced for Infernal Exalted; part of the deal is having vitality restored, so the general body warping process of the chrysalis grotesque includes being brought back to a physical appearance that roughly resembles their twenties (ironically, the Infernals are, by default, the shortest lived Exalted, with a mere 150 year lifespan). Abyssals also get their vitality restored as part of their Exaltation, which generally involves rewinding to young adulthood or so; however, as one of the benefits of the "champion of death" thing, Abyssals don't age at all, and could theoretically live forever under the right circumstances.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated">Promethean: The Created</a></em>, where <em>mortality</em> begins at twenty - a Promethean who completes the Great Work becomes a human in young adulthood, and can expect a normal lifespan from there on out.
</li><li> In the AD&amp;D 2nd Edition setting <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Birthright" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Birthright">Birthright</a></em>, people can inherit divine bloodlines, which are generally assumed not to manifest until puberty. One such power is extreme long life, from five to <em>one hundred</em> times longer.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a></em> book <em>Immortals</em> features a group of beings called the Purified, who became immortal through one of several rituals that involved dying and then coming back to life. No matter how old they were when they performed the ritual, when they come back to life, they always come back in a body that is physiologically in its mid-twenties.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>:
<ul><li> Juvenat treatments retard aging, but do not affect maturation—thus, nobles, Inquisitors, and other important people can appear to be in their thirties or forties at two to three hundred years of age. The treatments are not perfect, so the appearance of a very healthy 40-50 year old is most common, barring additional surgery.
</li><li> During the Horus Heresy the Primarchs and the Space Marines were both considered functionally immortal. The Primarchs rapidly reached maturity and then seemed to stop aging, while the process that creates the Space Marines is performed prior to puberty and bumps the subject into an eight-foot adult colossus. Post-Heresy it's a bit muddled: one Primarch is known to have survived for 1,000 years, but the rest are either dead, in suspended animation while inches from death, lost or Daemons (which immortality comes naturally for). As for the Space Marines, only one has been found to survive the 10,000 years from the Heresy to the setting's present, and he was rendered so infirm that he was unable to move and expired shortly after his discovery. The rest tend to last no longer than three centuries at war, with some reaching 1,000 years still able to fight.
</li></ul></li><li> In one of the earlier <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> sourcebooks, a researcher notes that elves seemed to have some kind of mechanism that caused their aging process to stop for a period of time, but there also were indicators of a latent reactivation trigger that would kick in after a couple of centuries. He then went on wondering what if there were a few that didn't have that second trigger. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> There are a few. Harlequin is one of them. He's outlived pretty much everyone and every civilization.</span>
</li><li> Played for laughs (like just about every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy">High Fantasy</a> trope) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheSpoils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheSpoils">The Spoils</a>.</em> 3lv3s (elves) live for centuries, but spend almost all of that time as <em>adolescents</em>, rather than young adults, meaning that the Gearsmith Trade they call home is littered with juvenile pranks and toilet humor.

<ul><li> As discovered later in the game, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kratos and Yuan</span> both had their aging halted at twenty-something. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mithos</span>, on the other hand, got it stopped when he was still a kid, and had to learn a special technique to make himself look older.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden">Suikoden</a></em> series; the True Runes keep their bearers from aging <em>at all</em>, leading to one character who's been physically a child for over <em>three hundred years</em>. The effects lasted long enough that they didn't even age while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Fog Ship Guide held onto the Soul Eater</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenIV">Suikoden IV</a></em>.

<ul><li> And apparently after taking it off, some can live for <em>much</em> longer due to some lingering effects of the rune, and in some cases, like with the blue moon rune, gain immortality permanently as vampires, not having to feed as long as they're in range.
</li><li> However at least the runes allow bearers to hit puberty before the whole immortality thing sets in. Otherwise characters like Luc and Sasarai who are implied to have had their runes since birth would still be infants. The theory is that the rune stops aging at its prime as defined by JRPG standard (i.e. mid to late teens).
</li></ul></li><li> Pretty much how the aging process for demons native to Veldime works in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea2CursedMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea2CursedMemories">Disgaea 2</a></em>.
<ul><li> Averted with non-Veldime demons, who typically have 500 years worth of puberty to look forward to.
</li><li> Angels also have the same problem as demons from netherworlds apart from Veldime. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveFreak">Flonne</a> is the oldest from the trio of main characters of the first game at 1509 (Etna and Laharl are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">1470 and 1313 respectively</a>) yet all of them look like there's no real difference apart from height.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em>, especially in fanon, plays with this trope for all it's worth, thanks to it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a> who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">Really 700 Years Old</a>. The Scarlet sisters were born vampires and have a literal case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalImmaturity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalImmaturity">Immortal Immaturity</a>. All of the fairies in the series are referred to in <em>Perfect Memento</em> as having at most the appearance of a 10-year-old child and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGrowUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGrowUp">Can't Grow Up</a>. Most of the others, however, are adults who have lived thousands of years, and include some apparent teenagers who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality">truly immortal</a>. Yukari, especially, (thanks to dressing up and occasionally acting like a younger woman than she appears to be normally) gets jokes from fandom about being the "old maid" (in spite of only being a couple thousand years old, which is fairly normal by Touhou standards) by some corners, and having her boast that she's (eternally) seventeen by others.
<ul><li> The fairies may not fully fall under this trope as they are elemental embodiments that are reborn each time they die (which may occur with the changing of seasons according to some interpretations) rather than being immortal or long lived. The fact that the fairy maidens from the Scarlet Devil Mansion appear older then those anywhere else would suggest that fairies <em>can</em> age to an extent, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">usually die</a> before it occurs in any meaningful way.
</li><li> Played with another way by Byakuren, who appears to be the standard immortal hot 20-something saint. Her backstory reveals she originally hit her 80's and looked every day of it before she achieved full magical control of her body. The first thing she did was restore her own youth, the <em>second</em> thing she did was give herself immortality.
</li></ul></li><li> After her powers manifested, Aya Brea of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParasiteEve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParasiteEve">Parasite Eve</a></em> actually got physically younger. While she actively refused to use her abilities between games, by the time <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParasiteEve2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParasiteEve2">Parasite Eve 2</a></em> rolls around, Aya is permanently 21.
</li><li> Ms. Fortune from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skullgirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skullgirls">Skullgirls</a></em> has something like this. A stolen gem that she swallowed granted her immortality plus a wildly accelerated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> — which explains how she survived being <em>chopped to pieces</em> by Dahila and her goons who tracked her down to get the gem back. She hasn't aged a day since her supposed "death", and has worked out a way to use her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovecraftianSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovecraftianSuperpower">newly-detachable limbs and head</a> to her advantage in combat. Pity about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarsAreForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarsAreForever">scars</a>, though.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> plays with this repeatedly:
<ul><li> Averted by the asari, who are generally thought to leave childhood at forty, and are considered mature (if rather young) adults at 80. A century-old asari is considered "barely more than a child". They give live birth and just how long gestation takes is never stated, but given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">conversation</a> between an asari and her shorter-lived non-asari husband involving their two children, it probably is less than a decade.
</li><li> Played straight with the Krogan, who are considered battle-ready at a fairly young age and <em>stay</em> that way for at least a thousand years. They're also explosive breeders, which is why the turians and salarians resorted to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepopulationBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepopulationBomb">genophage.</a>
</li><li> Miranda states that because she was heavily genetically modified, she will likely live 50% longer than a normal human, and it is stated that her body is in its twenties even though she is in her thirties. She makes no mention of whether this affected her growth rate as a child, though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her genetically identical, but much younger, sister Oriana</span> grew up having a normal life, which would presumably be impossible if all aging happened slower than normal, so presumably they play this trope straight.
</li></ul></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Béluga and Elh</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Solatorobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Solatorobo">Solatorobo</a></em> zig-zag this trope together. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Béluga</span> plays it straight, appearing to be a young adult despite his age, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Elh</span> averts it by being stuck as a teenager. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After losing her immortality, she comments that she seems to have finally grown a bit after three hundred years.</span>
</li><li> Human-passing Nobodies from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> can be inferred to have this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> states they don't age, but the Nobodies who lost their hearts as kids seem to have aged normally since the time when they would have become Nobodies, while their fully-grown allies haven't aged a bit in the intervening decade-or-so (although Xaldin and Xigbar have noticeably different hair than Dilan and Braig, implying <strong>that</strong> continues to grow).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestIIRomancingTheStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestIIRomancingTheStones">King's Quest II: Romancing The Stones</a></em> (the fan remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestII">King's Quest II</a></em>), Little Red Riding Hood is retconned into a girl named Possum who lives with her elderly sick grandmother. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Her grandfather, in his youth, was turned into a vampire. Though he remained a friendly one, he went into seclusion, ashamed of what he had become. When he discovers that his elderly wife is about to die, he turns her into a vampire so she can live with him and be eternally young; as a result, she takes on the appearance of a 30-40 year old. He also turns Possum, previously a squeaky-voiced child, into a deep-voiced fully grown adult.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>, this appears to be the case for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLived" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLived">Long-Lived</a> racers of Mer (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">Elves</a>).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note07s7d');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note07s7d" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note07s7d');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though <em>probably</em> not the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent">Orsimer</a>.</span> Of the few examples in the series' lore and backstory, Mer children seem to age similarly to human children until they reach adulthood, at which point their aging slows down considerably. Queen Barenziah, a Dunmer (Dark Elf), is the most prominent example. Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InGameNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InGameNovel">biographical book series</a> portray her as growing up as a precocious teen and being considered an adult once she was 18 years old. That was nearly 500 years before the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">Morrowind</a></em> where she's still alive and well, if noticeably aged.
</li><li> The Padjal of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> are a race of extremely long-lived, if not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless">ageless</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornedHumanoid">Horned Humanoids</a> that cease visibly aging around adolescence. Some of the Padjal met in game have the appearance of a young child, while others resemble teenagers. The one who's most relevant to the story, of course, looks like a young adult. Padjal start out as regular Hyur children, but at some point during their childhood they are "chosen" by the Elementals of the forest. This causes them to grow horns on their head and stop aging. The Conjurer's Guild leader is one, and he comments that while he may look like a child to you, he is really a couple of hundred years old.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims3">The Sims 3</a></em>, supernatural Sims age normally until the Young Adult stage. After that, the lifespans of fairies and vampires are 5 times the length of regular Sims, and the lifespans of werewolves are 1.5 times as long.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims4">The Sims 4</a></em>, Sims that are born vampires age normally until they become young adults. Once they reach young adulthood, they stop aging entirely.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em>, the aging process of the transhuman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreCursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreCursors">Orokin</a> and their profit-crazed descendants, the Corpus, have been <em>dramatically</em> slowed down. Darvo is 105 years old, looks 20, and acts and is treated like an unruly teenager. However, the aging seems to stop at the mid 40s rather than 20s; Alad V, Frohd Bek, and Nef Anyo are all several hundred years old and look like 40-something <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FashionVictimVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FashionVictimVillain">fashion victims</a>. Teshin was around when the Orokin Empire was at its height a millenia ago and likewise looks like he's in his early 40s. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Tenno look like teenagers or young adults, yet are nearly as old as Teshin. It's not made clear if it's from their life support systems, their times in cryosleep, or from standard Orokin augmentation.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FortuneSummoners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FortuneSummoners">Fortune Summoners</a></em>: Literally, for the Goblin-Elf hybrids known as the Elm, except they're not immortal:
<div class="indent"> The typical Elm has a lifespan of roughly a millenia and a half; they age in a similar fashion to humans until the age of 20, at which point they appear 'immortal' like an elf.
</div></li><li> As the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateLifeForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateLifeForm">Ultimate Life Form</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog">Shadow the Hedgehog</a> is completely immune to disease and his body will supposedly never age, and he's already over 50 years old. He's usually portrayed as physically the same age as the teenaged Sonic, if not a little older. The "supposedly" is due to the fact he's spent most of that 50+ years trapped in suspended animation, so it's something of an open question if he still has room to keep growing.
</li><li> Averted by Zora in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em>. The Zora race in the Era of the Wilds is long-lived compared to other Hyrulean races, but their growth process is appropriately elongated as well; a young-looking Zora girl notes that she's already an adult by Zora standards (and is older than most Hylian adults who visit Zora's Domain), but simply hasn't hit her growth spurt yet.

The entire human race mysteriously stops aging or dying (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalInfertility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalInfertility">or reproducing</a>) in April of 2026, but it's then clarified that children conceived before that date are still born and grow to adulthood, as do those who were still children at the time.

<ul><li> Rankers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TowerOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TowerOfGod">Tower of God</a></em> are people who have both climbed the tower high enough and mastered Shinsu enough they are completely immortal. Almost all of them look extremely young when in fact each and everyone of them is at least <em>500</em> years old, that being the average time it takes to become a Ranker in the first place.
<ul><li> Anaak Jahad is an extremely short and child like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">lizard person</a> who is in fact <em>300</em> hundred years old.
</li></ul></li><li> Read <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nuklearpower.com/2003/09/16/episode-330-dial-b-for-murder/">this page<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/EightBitTheater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/EightBitTheater">8-Bit Theater</a></em>; the lower left panel is fairly creepy.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Drowtales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Drowtales">Drowtales</a></em>, fae age at 1/2 human rate and stop aging at around 60, thus making them the physical equivalent of a 30 year old human. A fae can wind up aging more than this due to a condition called mana deprivation if they go outside of the mana pool for too long, and if not treated quickly this condition can be terminal and eventually kill them, and even if it's corrected in time they can still look older than average.
</li><li> Averted and lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/IrregularWebcomic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/IrregularWebcomic">Irregular Webcomic!</a></em>, when one of the characters in the <em>Fantasy</em> theme (Mordekai) asks the elf Alvissa why her race hadn't outbred everyone and overpopulated the world. Her answer: "Elven children breast feed for 30 years, teethe for 20 years, throw tantrums for about 100 years, and don't take to toilet training until they're about 200... Elves invented effective contraception before we could use fire."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Inverloch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Inverloch">Inverloch</a></em>, elves seem to age at the same rate as humans do up until they are fully mature, and then they stop aging. Except for the Severed, who are mortal and continue aging at the same rate as humans until they are cured.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Pandect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Pandect">Pandect</a></em>, Aces (animals with human souls and the ability to switch to a human body) stop aging entirely in their animal bodies, and the human body ages to about mid-20s and then remains there for the rest of their (very long) lives. Justified in that they have to earn Ace: the prolonged period of youth is part of the reward.
</li><li> Genetic elites in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheCyantianChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheCyantianChronicles">The Cyantian Chronicles</a></em>, though their age catches up to them quickly as they reach the end of their lifespan (ranging from 120 years in foxes to nearly a millennium in wolves).
<ul><li> Also elite wolves don't reach their full height of about 7'6" for several decades, as Darius and his classmates are teenagers or mid-twenties they tend to be pretty short (~6 feet) by their species' standards.
</li></ul></li><li> Very common with the long-lived races in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DanAndMabsFurryAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DanAndMabsFurryAdventures">Dan and Mab's Furry Adventures</a></em>, pretty much every creature race that looks like beings effectively stops aging in their 20s.
<ul><li> In the case of the Cubi their major abilities do not awaken until their early 20s, and as one of those abilities is shape-shifting they can look any age they wish for the rest of their lives.
</li><li> As demonstrated by Cyra herself <a class="urllink" href="http://missmab.com/Comics/Vol_1213.php">here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick">The Order of the Stick</a></em>:
<ul><li> Averted amongst elves, according to Vaarsuvius:
<div class="indent"><strong>Haley</strong>: I can't really see the downside of — <br/><strong>Vaarsuvius</strong>: Twenty years in diapers. <br/><strong>Haley</strong>: Oh.
</div></li><li> At one point, we meet a pair of elven children who are stated to be twenty-five years old. We're then told they're in kindergarten.
</li><li> In a side story, an elven ghost mentions children breastfeeding for seventeen years. The humans she's talking to are horrified.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em> gives us another long-lived example via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a>: higher-blooded trolls live much longer than lower-blooded ones with hundreds or even a thousand years difference between their expected lifespans, but all of the trolls we've seen so far appear to have aged at the same rate.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GunnerkriggCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GunnerkriggCourt">Gunnerkrigg Court</a></em> has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jones, who has existed since the Hadean eon (the formation of the Earth itself), and still appears to be a human woman in her late twenties or early thirties. She is not sure where she came from, what she is, or why she appears human at all, as it was obviously several billion years until she saw any creature that looked like herself</span>.
</li></ul><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ElGoonishShive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ElGoonishShive">El Goonish Shive</a></em>, this holds true for elfs, the children of Immortals and humans. Adrian Raven, the son of Pandora, has been <a class="urllink" href="http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=2439">stuck in his early twenties for multiple lifetimes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. He also spent those lifetimes in his twenties thinking he was incapable of conceiving children, which causes some awkwardness when it's discovered that isn't true and two characters in the present day are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his distant descendant and his biological daughter</span>.
<ul><li> The same also applies to immortals themselves. Even when they "reset" (which they need to do every couple of centuries to minimize <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a>), their reset form will usually be physically and mentally a young adult. This even applies to immortals who reset improperly, and thus do not inherit any memories from previous incarnations.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DragonSanctuary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DragonSanctuary">Dragon Sanctuary</a></em> has this for half-elves, at least. For full blooded ones, they must spend 100 years aging before looking the equivalent of a twenty year old human.
