</p><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbodimentOfVice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbodimentOfVice">Representing a particular sin or vice</a>, most often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed">Greed</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil">Ambition</a> or Wrath.
<ul><li> If the hero <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbodimentOfVirtue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbodimentOfVirtue">represents a particular virtue</a>, the Villain's vice will often be the inverse (see the point below about opposites). Also common (especially when the Hero is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>) is a vice they share in common, but one which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrViceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrViceGuy">the hero overcomes</a> and the Villain embraces.

<ul><li> Speaking differently than the rest of the characters (e.g. Jafar's regal-esque accent and Scar's eccentric drawl. Or they're just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilBrit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilBrit">Evil Brits</a>).

<ul><li> Uses that deception to further his/her own ends. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsActHeroesReact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsActHeroesReact">This plan generally moves the plot</a>, and is essential to the hero(es)'s character development/journey.

</li></ul></li><li> At their core, behind it all, Classic Villains are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">complete opposite</a> of the heroes, lacking the strengths the hero does, while being strong where the hero is weak.
</li><li> An iconic death, usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">brought on by the character's own flaws</a>.
</li></ul><p>In a nutshell, a villain who is iconically evil and represents a certain sin deep down, who deceives the heroes to further his own ends, is essential to the heroes' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, and is defeated iconically in a super-dramatic final battle, usually due to his own flaws.
</p><p>This is extremely common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon">Disney Animated Canon</a>, where it could be said that any given villain follows this formula, though the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifiers</a> may be in the works of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, where, likewise, any given villain could fit this mold perfectly.

Used correctly as a structure (and not an exhaustive list) these traits highlight both the hero and villain in contrast, hopefully making both more memorable and giving them chemistry with each other, justify the villain's actions in terms of his emotional traits, and gives him a sendoff that feels appropriate to the audience.

It's not that she wants <em>more</em>, she just wants it her way. Wears furs, speaks in an over-the-top manner, clouds of cigarette smoke. Pretends to be friendly with the dalmatians' owners to get access to the puppies. Defeated by being in a crash during a dramatic car chase. Total opposite of the heroes, in spades. She doesn't die, but she's defeated because of her lack of self control (Karmic Defeat?). In the original book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHundredAndOneDalmatians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHundredAndOneDalmatians">The Hundred and One Dalmatians</a></em>, she suffers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga">Humiliation Conga</a> — <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">all her husband's money was in the furs at her home, so when those were destroyed by the puppies, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkunkStripe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkunkStripe">black and white</a> hair goes half white, half <em>green</em> from shock.

An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">Evil Chancellor</a> with a black and red motif, which extends to his kingdom when he takes over, Jafar has both a villain song and a kick ass leitmotif. However, his nice and professional demeanor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil">drops when he gets close to getting what he wants</a>, and he's a full-fledged sufferer of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">Chronic Backstabbing Disorder</a>.

Vice: Pride/Envy. A ruthless young ruler with a lust for power to contrast Aladdin's insecurities about becoming a good Sultan. While he's both mighty and cunning, he's also very arrogant, seeing himself as the "Most powerful sorcerer of their generation". He is envious of Aladdin gaining power "the easy way" through his engagement to Jasmine and having the Genie to grant him magical assistance, while Mozenrath had to sacrifice his own hand and a big part of the rest of his lifespan for magical power.

Vice: Greed. A brawny looking man of action compared to scrawny bookworm Milo Thatch, Rourke has no qualms about dooming a whole civilization and fatally shooting its king while making himself rich in the process. He even throws his right hand woman to her death. In the end, thanks to Milo and company, Rourke ends up crystallized and shattered to death.

Vice: Pride and Lust. He is not visually distinctive from most Disney heroes and characters, but this is intentional. He is intended to be the complete opposite of the Beast character; the Beast is ugly and has a nasty temper, but is also noble and inwardly kind (though he struggles to make this apparent at first). Gaston is handsome and popular but despicable and inwardly monstrous. Might have been a Lovable Buffoon if he weren't such a complete asshole, but the effect stays the same. Most audiences tend not to take him seriously, as most of the plot moves without him. Has not one, but two songs, plus a reprise - the former and reprise are about how <em>great</em> he is. The Beast spares Gaston's life in the climax, but - proving that he is beyond redemption - he stabs the Beast in the back; in doing so, he accidentally falls to his death.

As for opposites, she's old, scheming, and malicious while Kuzco is young, impatient, and merely thoughtless; she's pale and wears dark colors while everyone else is tanned and wears bright colors.

As we learn in her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong">Villain Song</a> "Snuff Out The Light", Yzma is working with Supai, a being of darkness, to extinguish the light of the Sun and preserve what little of her youthful looks she has left to stay young and beautiful forever. In exchange, Supai is allowed to rule <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNightThatNeverEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNightThatNeverEnds">a world of darkness</a>.

Knowing that he could never inherit a kingdom for his own, he intends to take over Arendelle by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">marrying into the Royal family</span>, and then killing both sisters. Although he's not the direct cause of the movie's main conflict, it was his deceptions <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">i.e. pretending to be Anna's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> and causing her to argue with Elsa over their isolation</span> that triggers the plot into such direction. He also shares a number of similarities to both Anna and Elsa: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">like Anna, he is estranged to his older siblings, and like Elsa, he conceals his true emotions. But while the sisters want to reconcile with each other, Hans never appears to, as he even plans to upstage his newfound achievements in their faces.

Vice: Envy/Wrath/Pride, with a dash of Sloth due to him ruining the Pridelands through a mix of laziness and cowardice, and was willing to have all the pride lands denizens starve to death if it meant keeping his throne on Pride Rock. Often stated as the king of all the Disney villains, this guy traumatized many a child with his assassination of Mufasa, and his musical number that's reminiscent of Nazi Germany. Wildly different looking than the other lions, he is copper colored with a black mane (though apparently he resembled Mufasa's much more honorable father, in a bit of a subversion), and was extremely skinny. Is eventually done in by his own cowardice when he blames his horrible actions on his henchmen.

Granted, his hatred is directed at a boy who <em>cut off his hand and fed it to a crocodile</em>, but that's really just icing on the cake. While this isn't elaborated on in the Disney film, the novel states that Hook hates Pan because he's so cocky, and because he seems to have good form without realizing it. He clearly hates his crew, ready to claw any of them when they begin to doubt him or slip up in the slightest way, and berates Smee for his incompetence when he's not cowering behind him when the crocodile's about. On top of that, he's fairly foppish, dressing in ridiculously ornate coats when the rest of his crew settles for far more practical clothing<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0gftl');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0gftl" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0gftl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though this is, to some extent, Truth In Television with respect to nautical traditions</span>. He also serves as a perfect foil to Peter in a way few realize. While many suggest that Hook represents adulthood because his actor usually also plays Mr. Darling, Hook's profession of piracy denounces any sort of actual responsibility that comes with growing up. In essence, Hook is not so different from Pan, he's just in an adult body. Of course, he also gets the iconic death in the novel of being kicked by Peter into the crocodile's jaws.

While Tony is naive, and thus allows evil acts to happen through inaction, Obidiah is cunning and manipulative, causing many of the events in the storyline. Throughout the movie he pretends to be helping Tony Stark brave the wrath of the stockholders (after his decision to get out of the weapons business), while secretly closing him out. Partway through the movie, it is revealed that he not only is closing Tony out of the company, but he tried to kill him and is illegally trading weapons / dealing with terrorist organizations. Stane's Iron Monger suit in the movie also heavily contrasts with Stark's. While Stark's armor is sleek, colorful, and outfitted with weapons designed for efficiency and precision, the Iron Monger is grey, bulky, and heavily relies on Gatling guns, missiles, and excessive overkill.

In Heaven's Feel Kotomine's parallels to Shirou become quite obvious with the classic climactic conclusion being resolved by Kotomine's lack of purpose outside the emptiness that is at both Shirou and his own core. Shirou's nature lies in defining himself through others, which is the same as Kotomine. The reason it is a virtue for Shirou and a vice for Kotomine is that Shirou's self definition lies in aiding others while Kotomine's is in harming them. Lastly, in each of the routes he suffers a karmic and ironic death as a result of his past actions, which in two out of three routes happens when he confronts Shirou in a climactic final battle.

Their key split was that while Megatron sought to be named the next Prime and overthrow the guard with force, Optimus asked that the guard reform and was thus recognized as true prime material despite not asking for it. Overcome with Wrath, Megatron destroyed Cyberton searching for the Matrix of Leadership before bringing his war to Earth afterwards.
