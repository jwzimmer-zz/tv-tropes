</p><p>So you sit back and watch the ratings — which plummet faster than a rocket-propelled brick in a nosedive. What went wrong? In trying to avert making the classic mistake that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons">Viewers Are Morons</a>, you went too far and ended up assuming that they're <em>geniuses</em> instead. Of course, if you're working in a medium that doesn't need an audience of millions to be profitable, you may not care. While a lot less common than its more insulting opposite (any show without the "mass-market appeal" that the less high-brow stuff has will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">Screwed by the Network</a> without mercy), overestimating the audience can be more of a death knell than underestimating it, even without network sabotage.

There's also the trap of being so consumed with the complexities that you forget simpler things like plot and characterization.
</p><p>However, in the eyes of artists and some fans, this is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a>. There are many instances where a film with dense references and information provides an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnconventionalLearningExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnconventionalLearningExperience">Unconventional Learning Experience</a>, introducing high concepts in a dramatic, entertaining fashion. This empowers readers and viewers and makes them interested and curious in exploring offbeat ideas that they otherwise might have felt they are not educated to understand and accept, since many of them have internalized the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons">Viewers Are Morons</a> ideas and reflexively feel some movies or books are not for them. For instance, Joseph Campbell's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHerosJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHerosJourney">Heroic Journey</a> concept was fairly obscure before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> used a Heroic Journey plot, which brought the concept into the mainstream. There's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn">Society Marches On</a> to consider. The number of people with college educations is higher today than it was, say, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>, so what used to be obscure becomes mainstream with the passage of time, and indeed, new genres and new storytelling techniques are created because audiences have become too smart for old plots and hackneyed clichés. In the case of some artists, the dense play of text and subtext for them <em>is</em> the reason why they make art in the first place, and they set out to fill it with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus">Genius Bonuses</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewatchBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewatchBonus">Rewatch Bonuses</a> so that audiences can immerse themselves in understanding the work fully.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Ironically, the reverse is also true. Art forms that we regard today as High Art like opera, classical music, poetry, and even Greek or Shakespearean tragedy were popular and commercial work in the day. Audiences across the class and educational spectrum had no trouble understanding and following these works. And indeed, they were all filled with topical and common references that audiences had no trouble following.
</p><p>It is this distinction which is why you see so much dissonance in understanding humor as a general topic. It is far easier for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator">Lowest Common Denominator</a> to "get" a joke, if there is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">clear "butt"</a> of the joke. However, people who really follow humor aren't aiming to disparage people, but are instead in finding out the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistEnding">Twist Ending</a>, or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">Pun</a>.
</p><p>The most successful way to do this may be to provide a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus">Genius Bonus</a>. If a writer gives the more intellectual content a small dose at a time, viewers can still enjoy the work at their level, but those who get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a> will enjoy its hidden depths.

<ul><li> There was a commercial that assumed people had more knowledge of what goes into their deli meats than they generally do. The commercial has two cows standing on a stage. One represents the advertiser while the other represents the competition, and from offstage someone throws a bucket of seaweed over the competition's cow. The cow representing the company, however, remains clean and "natural". They were trying to illustrate how their competition used filler materials (seaweed derivatives being very common as filler ingredients) in their meat products but that they didn't, and where thereby superior quality meats. Too bad the commercial never bothered to explain itself because most people didn't know about filler much less what the seaweed had to do with anything.
</li><li> Denny's restaurants had a bacon-themed special called "Baconalia," a pun on "Bacchanalia," which were cult orgies in Ancient Greece and Rome. One wonders if Denny's wanted their patrons to get the esoteric reference or not.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em> is pretty hard on the brain. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence</a></em>, for example, is an intertextual rumination on posthumanism that requires an understanding of the works of people like <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Bellmer">Hans Bellmer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for proper comprehension.
<ul><li> While being comparatively lightweight, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Stand Alone Complex</a></em> discusses sociology and memes, and if you understood it fully the first time, you either already had an undergrad understanding of sociology, or earned one in the process of puzzling it out. It also has a tendency to have characters spout plot points (often convoluted political situations) at an accelerated clip. It then rarely, if ever, repeats itself. Example: In 2nd Gig the full source of the title 'Individual Eleven' and its supposed contents are explained once. Despite coming in in multiple episodes before and after the explanation. The extent of the subtleties in these conversations are enough to quickly lose all but astute Political Science majors the first time through, much more so than the sociology and philosophy references. Not to mention being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ultimately a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a></span>.
</li><li> Near the end of the 2nd Gig, Kuze has a discussion with Yousuke Aramaki, which requires a customary understanding of basic Marxist economic philosophy to piece together.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SerialExperimentsLain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SerialExperimentsLain">Serial Experiments Lain</a></em>:
<ul><li> The central theme revolves around highly technical aspects of computers and networking, and the series is a well-known member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">Anime</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> Club.
</li><li> Several extended Jungian metaphors.

How come we don't get <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twentieth_Anniversary_Macintosh">designs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Experiments_Lain#Apple_computers">like those?"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Lain lacks a plot at all until you do the research. The plot only emerges at all once you get to the point where you're looking at the patent file for Microwave Audio Induction and trying to figure out if on Schuuman Resonance frequencies it can be used to trigger individual action potentials (nb: Schumann resonance is actually a massive frequency range — the number given in the show of 7.83Hz is actually the median).
</li></ul></li><li> Many anime series produced by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BeeTrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BeeTrain">Bee Train</a> studio (most famously, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir">Noir</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Madlax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Madlax">Madlax</a></em>) require so much reading between the lines and background cultural knowledge that most viewers refuse to believe that something worthy was there in the first place. As a result, the rather small fan community deliberately positions itself as "intelligent fans", actively shunning whom they refer to as "fanboys" and "haterz".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em> is positively dripping with Western symbolism. Only those familiar with Catholicism, Protestantism, the Reformation, and the cultural and religious conflicts between the two Christian branches will understand all of the references and subplots that litter the storyline. The same could also be said of the characters' backgrounds, which involve everything from the Ottoman Turks and collapse of the Eastern Roman Empire to the Nazis of World War II and the continued disputes about Northern Ireland. The plot literally requires viewers to possess at least a decent working knowledge of European history to grasp anywhere near all of the allusions that are made to real-life historical figures, their peoples, their religions, and their possible connection to supernatural creatures like vampires, werewolves, and other monsters.
<ul><li> Many of the characters' and agency's names give hints about their nationality and roles in the plot, but don't expect anyone aside from those who are well-acquainted with European culture, Judeo-Christian religions, and fictional works to correctly deduce or identify the reasons behind their significance.

The series seems to take for granted that all of its audience has some basic awareness of the historical characters it's portraying, which... for the most part, particularly in the West, they don't.

For instance, why is Leopon team called that, and why is that particular tank in the hands of the Automotive Club? You'd first have to know that a leopon is a hybrid big cat (leopard and lioness crossbreeding), and that their Tiger (P) tank uses a hybrid transmission (petrol engines mated to electric motors). You'd then have to remember that while the gun worked fine, the Tiger (P) was more infamous for its notoriously unreliable motive systems—it's with Automotive Club because no other team would have the time or patience to make it work.

The finer details about the abilities and philosophy of the Plana are rooted in quantum physics jargon, with only vague allusions to how knowing this stuff explains things like Kaibas new Duel Disk system being able to counter their powers <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and summon Obelisk the Tormentor during his duel with Aigami</span>.

<div class="indent"><strong>Jack</strong>: There's nothing wrong with being elite. <br/>Or another example. <br/>This one isn't about collectibles but it's the same kind of thing. I'm in a book store ... for new books. I've gone a little bit crazy and I'm about to spend a couple of hundred bucks. I murmur under my breath "money's too tight to mention". <br/>Now the guy behind the register, he hears this. He looks at me, nodding his head knowingly like we're in some "club of cool" together. He says, "Yeah, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">Simply Red</a>" like it's a password, and now we do the secret handshake. <br/>And I'm thinking "Simply Red"? Lame English band. More soul at a polka convention. And the book store guy thinks he's on some kind of inside loop with that. <br/><strong>Sadie</strong>: Jack, that's the smuggest thing I ever heard. A guy tries to be nice and you stand there hating him just because he hasn't heard of the Valentine Brothers. <br/>You're like my ex-boyfriend. He was that way about authors. He'd deliberately drop obscure quotes and references. He'd take over conversations at parties. But none of what he read was for the love of it. His knowledge was like a weapon. <br/>Don't tell me you're like that. I don't want another jerk. I've had... <br/>Hey, why are you smiling? <br/><strong>Jack</strong>: Because you've heard of the Valentine Brothers. <br/>(Naturally, since Jack and Sadie both know that the Valentine Brothers are a soul duo who originally performed "Money's Too Tight To Mention" before Simply Red covered it, they have no reason to tell the readers this.)

It's not just the continuity that hung up fans on Final Crisis — comic book nerds are very good at continuity. Morrison was also doing a lot of meta and philosophical weirdness about the nature of storytelling and the superhero genre in particular, which is a great way to annoy people who don't care about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor">Barthes</a> or Morrison's issues with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">William Moulton Marston</a> and just want to see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustHereForGodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustHereForGodzilla">characters they love beat up characters they love to hate in heroic and impressive ways.</a>

Combined with extreme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness">Medium Awareness</a>, the comics are truly incomprehensible to non-comic readers (and often a bit confusing to regular readers who just aren't up on their history lessons).

<ul><li> Every time Frollo appears, a background chorus sings "Kyrie elison," meaning "Lord have mercy." The song in which he murders Quasimodo's mother also has a background choir singing Dies Irae, containing "beware the coming of the judge!"

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SouthlandTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SouthlandTales">Southland Tales</a></em> is drenched in references to literature and politics that range from punishingly obvious to downright impenetrable. Everyone watching the film can tell that it's certainly supposed to be about <em>something</em>, but what the hell is actually going on or what it's all supposed to mean in the end generally baffles most audiences. Ultimately the director certainly had a lot of faith in the audience that they'd be able to follow his thought processes. Or he just intended to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">make a longer film</a> with more explanation, or thought more people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">would read the prequel comic</a>. Though the longer cut at Cannes got similar, if not even more negative responses than the final cut.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Primer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Primer">Primer</a></em> was written by a math graduate who studied physics intensively to produce one of the most plausible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> movies ever. In the words of one reviewer, "Anybody who claims they fully understand what's going on in <em>Primer</em> after seeing it just once is either a savant or a liar." Reportedly, writer-director Shane Carruth didn't think the movie would be too hard for the average viewer to figure out. Following the events that the audience (and main characters) can see happening is challenging, but possible. On the other hand, there's so much going on that either isn't shown directly or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndingChangesEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndingChangesEverything">isn't what it seems</a> that, by the end of the movie, even the two main characters end up completely baffled by the massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">Gambit Pileup</a> they've been playing against each other.
</li><li> Hardly anyone understands all the vital plot points from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDescent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDescent">The Descent</a></em> first time 'round. Either they completely missed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sarah went crazy</span> or they didn't connect the dots and get that the crawlers were evolved from cavemen who stayed down in the cave or they would miss the subtext that Sarah possibly only imagined the crawlers or they would make a more simple mistake and forget the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">seemingly unimportant singular lines of dialogue which would explain things later on</a>. To top it off, it's very difficult to tell who's who in the dark, and fans are still arguing over what the hell the ending <em>means</em>...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHungerGames">The Hunger Games</a></em> and its sequels are based on a book series that contains a huge amount of internal monologue describing the protagonist's emotions and thoughts. But that text is completely removed in the movies. Instead, the viewers have to concentrate on the facial expressions and accentuation of the actors as well as on visual exposition to infer what happens in the heart and mind of the protagonist.
</li><li> Spike Lee's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwentyFifthHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwentyFifthHour">25th Hour</a></em> has a deleted scene where a pair of gangsters explain the exact reasons why the protagonist has 24 hours of freedom. Pretty much every single review either couldn't figure out the reasons within the context of the film, or presumed that the 24 hours were <em>not</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. They were, at least at the time.
</li><li> The climax of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TradingPlaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TradingPlaces">Trading Places</a></em> involves a surprisingly complex commodities market scheme. However, earlier in the film, the Duke brothers explain the basic concept of commodities trading in such simplistic turns that Billie Ray gives an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsideGlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsideGlance">Aside Glance</a> to the audience.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Videodrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Videodrome">Videodrome</a></em>. A good understanding of Marshall McLuhan's media theory is required to really get it.
</li><li> In the Director's Cut and the Final Cut, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner">Blade Runner</a></em>'s world is a complicated one with little to no flat explanation, a slow pace, and a lot of rumination on human nature. It requires a certain type of viewer to understand and enjoy it to its fullest. The theatrical cut, however, includes narration in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons">Viewers Are Morons</a> move by the studio.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate">Stargate</a></em>, the Egyptologist character figures out how to speak the language of the humans found beyond the stargate in about five minutes of dialog with the native girl he later has a romance with. When another character expresses amazement that he cracked the language so quickly, he observes modestly that he just had to get the vowels right. This is hilarious, but to catch the humor you need to know arcane details about how the vowels of Ancient Egyptian were reconstructed by modern scholars. In short: while we can <em>read</em> Ancient Egyptian, there is little data on how it was <em>pronounced</em>, and the sounds we assign the language today are probably off from what the actual language sounded like. That's exactly why you can hear Ra or Re used interchangeably, neither of which has been proven to be the genuine rendering of the god's original name (for all we know, it could just as well have been "Ro" or "Ri").
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Inception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Inception">Inception</a></em>. There's a lot to keep track of in this film, including dream rules and levels, and after the initial period of exposition and heist planning, Nolan expects you to figure it out for yourself. His next non-Batman movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Interstellar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Interstellar">Interstellar</a></em> manages to go even well beyond that. Having some basic knowledge about general relativity, space-time, and exoplanet research goes a very long way in figuring out what's actually going on. And it might require some deeper understanding of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Existentialism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Existentialism">existentialist philosophy</a> that underlies all of Nolan's movies to be able to figure out what anything of it might be supposed to mean.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheHistoryBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheHistoryBoys">The History Boys</a></em> there is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityHasNoSubtitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityHasNoSubtitles">entire scene spoken almost entirely in French</a>. There is also a lot of jokes that are more funny if viewers understand the context behind it, from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FriedrichNietzsche" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FriedrichNietzsche">Nietzsche</a> and from the Dissolution of the Monasteries to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BriefEncounter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BriefEncounter">Brief Encounter</a></em> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThomasHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThomasHardy">Thomas Hardy</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OceansTwelve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OceansTwelve">Ocean's Twelve</a></em> makes a point of omitting details and forgoing explicit exposition. It assumes the viewer will fill in the gaps. Though it never gives you all of the details, it does explain <em>how</em> things happen at the end via flashbacks.
</li><li> Much of Peter Greenaway's work fits this trope. For example, he commented in the DVD bonus features for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDraughtsmansContract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDraughtsmansContract">The Draughtsman's Contract</a></em> that he did not want to explain the plot and its ending within the film, feeling that the audience would understand what had happened. Many people disagree.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLostBladesman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLostBladesman">The Lost Bladesman</a></em> (2011) assumes that viewers are already familiar with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a></em>, specifically the arc about Guan Yu's journey of "slaying six generals at five passes" along the way to returning to Liu Bei, despite the fact that the movie's actual plot is <em>heavily</em> divergent from that arc, with almost no attempt to explain the surrounding circumstances.
</li><li> If you're not American, or even just a political apathetic American, you might have some difficulty understanding the basic plot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIdesOfMarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIdesOfMarch">The Ides of March</a></em> as the way in US Presidential candidates are nominated is quite unique and unlike any other country's in the world. The basics of the process are largely glossed over and it's assumed the audience is already familiar with them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrNobody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrNobody">Mr. Nobody</a></em>. The concept of Old Nemo's Memories, fractally nesting, equally possible subplots are easy to understand as concept, even while the film is jumping back and forth between them like hell. The fact that the scenes with the middle aged Nemo in this eyecancer pattern checkered vest within weirdly silent and hollow environments are littered amongst them does keeping track of the actual plot a little confusing at first. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">That they are in this exact weird way to shout out that they did never take place in any possible lifespan is not apparent to say the least. Old Nemo has no actual backstory, so they are merely fillers in the little boys imagination, just like pretty much all of the Film. The same Effect occurs another time at the End, the Fact that all these possible lives are just Imagined is quite nicely to digest, even that post-dream decision does make sense if you think about it afterwards, but to keep track of that Metaphor with this whole Universe turnaround does only make sense if you're high or on your fifth run.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMirror">The Mirror</a></em>: You need a pretty extensive knowledge of Russian literature and the ability to pay extremely close attention (the same actors play multiple characters in multiple timeframes; in the lead actor's case the two characters are even referred to by the same name to make it even more confusing) to make sense of it. It doesn't help that the subtitles on the Kino DVD don't translate or even mistranslate bits of dialogue.
</li><li> The otherwise scholocky low-budget horror film <em>.Com for Murder</em> assumes that the audience has a good familiarity with the 18th century German author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohannWolfgangVonGoethe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohannWolfgangVonGoethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSorrowsOfYoungWerther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSorrowsOfYoungWerther">The Sorrows of Young Werther</a></em>.
</li><li> One of the reasons why <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnnyDangerously" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnnyDangerously">Johnny Dangerously</a></em> has never caught on like other famous parody films from the same period (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Airplane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Airplane">Airplane!</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopSecret">Top Secret!</a></em> for example) was because it was parodying a genre (the 1930s gangster movie) that had faded from the public consciousness. Not only had 50 years passed since the genre was at its height, its place in the American collective unconscious had been supplanted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a></em> and its derivatives. It's very strange to note that although the movie came out in 1984 and was a parody of gangster movies, that there wasn't a single reference to <em>The Godfather</em> in it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptiveState" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptiveState">Captive State</a></em>: Surprisingly little exposition, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">a large cast</a>, and a lot of unanswered questions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnceUponATimeInHollywood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnceUponATimeInHollywood">Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</a></em> assumes that the viewer is already familiar with the real life Charles Manson murders. If you go in blind, there are certain aspects about the film that will hold little or no signifiance to the viewer otherwise, especially with its ending.

The grammar point in question is quite elementary, but the clue is hidden in half a page of untranslated French dialogue. While most of Sayer's original audience would have learned French in school, it's still quite a demand to make of the reader.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie">Agatha Christie</a> sometimes does this in her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HerculePoirot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HerculePoirot">Hercule Poirot</a> novels, or else puts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus">Bilingual Bonuses</a> in places where they <em>look</em> like they might be important. In "Murder on the Orient Express", the reported last words of the victim are in French. The characters talk about how important this phrase is but no one ever translates it to English for us poor saps in the 21st century that don't speak conversational French. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the end, it turns out that the actual words weren't important, and the killer[s] is/was was intentionally trying to have the other people on the train realize that the victim didn't speak French at all in a convoluted scheme for blame to fall elsewhere.</span>
</li><li> Not limited to English; Tolstoy and his contemporaries pulled this kind of thing all the time. Translations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnnaKarenina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnnaKarenina">Anna Karenina</a></em>, especially, are famous for retaining the French lines without bothering to so much as footnote them, making it doubly confusing by readers already confused by awkward translations of Russian idiom. However, in Russia and Europe of the 19th century, French was a common second language among the aristocracy and educated middle class so these references would have been understood and not necessarily fly over people's heads <em>then</em> as they might today.
</li><li> Poe parodies this in his essay "How to write a Blackwood Article" and the "Blackwood Article" that follows.
</li><li> The other thing you'll see in older literature is Latin tags — sayings or phrases in Latin in an otherwise English work. At a time when little children were taught Latin (partly as a basis or intro for learning other Romance languages), these little tags like <em>sine qua non</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2kuhc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2kuhc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2kuhc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">without which there is nothing</span> or <em>et hoc genus omne</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3o6dh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3o6dh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3o6dh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">and all those guys; or, and all that sort of thing</span> were assumed to be understood by anyone who could read. Some like "pro tem[pore]" and "RIP" (requiescat in pace) have made it into modern usage. Less often, you'll see Greek tags. Biblical phrases are also commonly used.
</li><li> In many non-English speaking circles, especially in continental Europe, an advanced grasp of at least written English is taken pretty much for granted and job announcements sometimes won't even mention this particular requirement due to it being not as much of a highlight and more so that a lack thereof would be considered a disadvantage (just like nobody boasts of being able to read and write). If you were to post a link to a news article in English on, say, a Swedish gaming forum, even if any of the users actually needed a translation, chances are they wouldn't dare to ask for fear of humiliation.

For instance, some early reviewers of the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flashman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flashman">Flashman</a></em> novel thought it was an actual memoir (despite the fact that the protagonist is a character from Victorian fiction). Oddly, one book, <em>Dickens of the Mounted</em>, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a>/pastiche of the Flashman series and actually has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawyerFriendlyCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawyerFriendlyCameo">Lawyer-Friendly Cameo</a> from Flashman and was <em>also</em> interpreted as being the actual memoirs of the protagonist (who was in this case actually a real person, the ne'er-do-well son of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens">Charles Dickens</a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> definitely counts. While some stories may appear to be even simple children's stories, every single novel in the series contains a VAST amount of parodies, references and allusions to many equally vastly different things. This ranges from history to quantum mechanics, and from popular culture to religion. Be it mythology, geography, Shakespeare, physics, popular culture or anything else, everything is discussed or parodied, and in order to understand all allusions one would be required to browse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> 24/7. However, the series is still easily accessible by those who do not have such knowledge, allowing the reader to enjoy it no matter how much he knows, but the more educated readers will still get a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus">Genius Bonus</a>.

A reference to the river Styx, which is located in the Greek underworld. The dark and gloomy afterlife place. Apparently, the German translator thought that viewers aren't so clever after all, and changed the horse's name to something that means "monster", so that it's clearer why, exactly, the protagonist decides to change the name to something less intimidating.
</li><li> You can read all the way through Erskine Childers' <em>The Riddle of the Sands</em> just for the gripping conspiracy that invented the modern espionage novel or the beautifully verbose and poetic descriptions of the sea... but having extensive knowledge of sailing in small boats certainly <em>helps</em>.
</li><li> Most readers find Dorothy Dunnett's Lymond Chronicles largely incomprehensible for the first 100 pages due to the untranslated Latin, Spanish, and French, the fact that most characters are referred to by multiple names, that much of the meaning comes from snippets of obscure medieval literary quotations that require knowledge of the (unprovided) full piece to understand, and the plot that assumes detailed knowledge of 16th century Scottish politics. There are two official guidebooks and multiple fan-made translations and literary-reference compilations to make up for this.

</li><li> The notes don't really help much; they were described by Louis Menand as "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/eliot/wasteland.htm">simply another riddle -- and not a separate one<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>". Eliot himself wrote in <em>The Frontiers of Criticism</em> that he started out just citing his quotations "with a view to spiking the guns of critics of my earlier poems who had accused me of plagiarism", before realising he had to come up with more material if the poem was going to be released as a book "with the result that they became the remarkable exposition of bogus scholarship that is still on view to-day".
</li><li> It also doesn't help that <em>even Eliot</em> seems to admit that some of the references make no sense without the notes. One of the cards during the Tarot reading represents the Fisher King, but not only is this not indicated in any way, Eliot claims to have no idea why he associates the two.

</div></li><li> While they can still be enjoyed on a superficial level, William Gibson's novels (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neuromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neuromancer">Neuromancer</a></em>, <em>Mona Lisa Overdrive</em>, <em>Idoru</em>, etc.) rely on complex and multilayered metaphors, both pop culture and "learned" allusions, and a blurring of traditional concepts of "human," "life," "technology" and "reality", among others. On the other hand, Gibson admits in interviews that readers shouldn't look too deep into the technical aspects of computer science and cyberspace in his works, because he didn't even <em>own</em> a computer until well after he'd written <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neuromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neuromancer">Neuromancer</a></em>, and was profoundly disappointed with how mundane it was. However, he <em>did</em> do the research; he's known to keep track of "the invisible literature" — scientific research papers.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesJoyce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesJoyce">James Joyce</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ulysses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ulysses">Ulysses</a></em>
<ul><li> It requires intimate knowledge of the history of literature (especially English-language literature), geography of Dublin, history of Ireland and a genius ability at recognizing allusions. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FinnegansWake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FinnegansWake">Finnegans Wake</a></em> requires... surrendering the possibility of comprehension, which was perhaps the point.
</li><li> Given that the title is the Roman name for Odysseus, understanding Homer's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdyssey">The Odyssey</a></em> is incredibly significant to the book. It also helps if you're familiar with Shakespeare's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet">Hamlet</a></em>.
</li><li> Although it must be pointed out that objections to Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em> in its day had to do with its straightforward look at sex and not the density of allusions per se. Even then a lot of his references were common reading material. Like <em>The Odyssey</em> may not have been widely read by the general public but it's hardly an obscure poem, nor is <em>Hamlet</em> for that matter. The Irish political references are very local but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">It Makes Sense in Context</a>.
</li><li> It should be noted: unlike with many other works on this page, Joyce was actually courteous enough to provide a <em>guide</em> to reading <em>Ulysses</em>, as he recognized that the novel might otherwise be a bit hard to follow. When he sent to the book to his friends Stuart Gilbert and Carlo Linati, he gave both of them rough outlines of its fundamental structure, pointing out some basic details of plot progression (like when and where each episode takes place, and which episodes are meant to parallel which chapters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdyssey">The Odyssey</a></em>), as well as listing some of the core symbols and themes in each episode, and laying out the central images and ideas of each episode (like which body parts, colors, and academic disciplines are supposed to figure into each episode). These outlines, now known as "<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_schema_for_Ulysses">The Gilbert Schema<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" and "<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linati_schema_for_Ulysses">The Linati Schema<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>", are very helpful in making the novel a bit more accessible.
</li></ul></li><li> The first half of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamFaulkner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamFaulkner">William Faulkner</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSoundAndTheFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSoundAndTheFury">The Sound and the Fury</a></em> is incomprehensible at first glance. Benjy, a 33-year-old with a profound mental disability, narrates the first section. He narrates all events in the present tense, <em>even if it's a past memory.</em> The second narrator is the incredibly intelligent and thoughtful Quentin Compson. The difficulty in his section stems from his narrative constantly shifting between what's actually happening, what he's thinking about, long sections of stream-of-consciousness narration without any punctuation, and even being able to tell what really does happen at some points. Case in point: Did Quentin just fantasize about having sex with his sister, or did it really happen?
<ul><li> And to make matters worse, Quentin is narrating his part of the story while having an extended mental breakdown. For the record, he didn't have sex with his sister, he only claimed to have done so because he felt it was better than the alternative.
</li><li> Part of the confusion stems from Faulkner's intent to have different points of view and time periods made explicit by the use of a variety of text colours. Therefore, a section narrated by Benjy in the 'present' would be printed in one colour, past events in another, and a section narrated by another character in a whole different colour. Printing expenses prevented the multicolour approach from going forward but the story retains the unannounced jumping perspective, making it a uniquely challenging narrative.
</li></ul></li><li> The epic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shogun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shogun">Shogun</a></em>, featuring a fish-out-of-water Englishman in late feudal Japan, presents a challenge with imported Japanese words and phrases. Author James Clavell shows a tendency to introduce and translate Japanese phrases exactly once, before proceeding to use them for the next thousand pages. Unless you happen to speak Japanese, you'd best be taking notes.
<ul><li> An understanding of the various real-life historical figures that the novel's characters are based on will greatly enrich your reading of the text, but once you realize who is supposed to stand in for who (and it's not difficult if you know the history, as Clavell's replacement names are very close to the original, especially for the big players) it spoils the ending.
</li></ul></li><li> Garry Kilworth's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WelkinWeasels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WelkinWeasels">Welkin Weasels</a></em> may suffer from this thanks to the rapid-fire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> rate. How many of the ten-year-old target audience will get references to Shelley, Coleridge, and Orwell, among others?
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanislawLem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanislawLem">Stanisław Lem</a>'s works are usually loaded with science and philosophy. Most of his parodistic works, like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCyberiad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCyberiad">The Cyberiad</a></em> and <em>Mortal Engines</em> also require good knowledge of literature theory.

However, it also qualifies as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus">Parental Bonus</a> since they're mostly just used as plot devices and so the reader doesn't really have to understand how everything works and just accept that it does work.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents">A Series of Unfortunate Events</a></em> falls firmly into this category, particularly for a children's series. While this is partially Lampshaded with the constant refrain of "a word which here means-" (which often is for words that are incredibly easy to understand), it still does not explain the constant references, particularly in character names (Esme Squalor, Nero the fiddle-playing principal, Frank and Earnest, Duncan and Isadora, Mr. Poe, etc.) or the convoluted plots and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> themes. While many kids around the age of 10 have enjoyed every minute of these books, they live and breathe this trope. This actually tremendously increases 'family value' of the books, because they can be very entertaining to kids and parents alike.
</li><li> The works of author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CormacMcCarthy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CormacMcCarthy">Cormac McCarthy</a>.
<ul><li> Some can be thoroughly enjoyed without being well-versed in McCarthy's interests or history — such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AllThePrettyHorses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AllThePrettyHorses">All the Pretty Horses</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NoCountryForOldMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NoCountryForOldMen">No Country for Old Men</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRoad">The Road</a></em> — but it definitely helps to make sense of it all (especially with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BloodMeridian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BloodMeridian">Blood Meridian</a></em> and <em>Suttree</em>).
</li><li> His <em>Border Trilogy</em> (of which <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AllThePrettyHorses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AllThePrettyHorses">All the Pretty Horses</a></em> is the first) has characters have whole conversations entirely in Spanish. There's a website where you can download a list of all of the translated dialogue, which you may need by your side during the reading.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EzraPound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EzraPound">Ezra Pound</a>
<ul><li> Try reading his "Cantos" without a way of translating Chinese, ancient Greek, Latin, Italian, and <em>Basque</em>. Yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishLanguage">Basque!</a>
</li><li> And when you find that way of translating Chinese, offer it to Pound. His Chinese is actually kind of awful.
</li><li> Once you've done that, make sure to study 14th and 15th century Italian painting and political history. And the world of prewar Europe. And Greek mythology.
</li></ul></li><li> Even worse: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThomasPynchon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThomasPynchon">Thomas Pynchon</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GravitysRainbow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GravitysRainbow">Gravitys Rainbow</a></em>. Even having the necessary knowledge in history, statistics, physics and linguistics to understand the background might not be enough to get through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> it is. Though the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> might be the point since it's about the unsolvable post-war industrial complex <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> that is too big for a single plot to encompass it.
</li><li> William Gaddis' <em>JR</em> is a 700-plus page novel with no chapter stops that is almost entirely composed of conversational dialogue that is sometimes packed with financial jargon. And it doesn't even tell you which character is speaking; you have to figure it out from context clues. <em>A Frolic of His Own</em>, another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doorstopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doorstopper">Doorstopper</a>, is written in a similar style, and full of legal jargon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Idlewild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Idlewild">Idlewild</a></em> by Nick Sagan and its sequels, several times. For instance, the character of Fantasia averts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSchizophreniaConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSchizophreniaConspiracy">The Schizophrenia Conspiracy</a>, but you're assumed to know what hebephrenic schizophrenia <em>is</em>.

Sometimes the works they reference don't even exist, which means it's the reader's job to find out what's really obscure and what's just not real.
</li><li> <em>Blindsight</em>, a hard science fiction novel by Peter Watts, is probably one of the worst offenders there are. No, you will not read "radio signals were picked up". You will read, I kid you not, "Fourier transforms appeared".
</li><li> Pretty much anything by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerZelazny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerZelazny">Roger Zelazny</a>. From minor things like expecting you to know why Corwin "closed her eyes with kisses four" so as not to break the spell, to needing to have a pretty good understanding of Hindu-Buddhist myths to get the whole of "The Lord of Light," to simply needing a background in pulp fiction to know that one of the guys who tries to kill Red, is Sunlight and the guy Red hands him over to is Doc Savage.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnMFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnMFord">John M.

</li><li> Almost any fiction until the mid-19th century or later. Many specific examples appear upthread with individual entries, but until relatively recently it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trope">trope</a> of most fiction to be filled with allusions to the classics, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">the Bible</a>, major contemporary philosophers, and other languages. <a class="urllink" href="http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/resource_literature.html">If you want the secret to all those references, go here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkHalf">The Dark Half</a></em> has an in-universe example. The protagonist has written several highly intellectual novels with great reviews and poor sales. In the meantime he has also written under a pen name intentionally trashy books that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator">engorge themselves on sex and violence</a> which have gone on to become bestsellers. King wrote the book in part as a response to his pen name Richard Bachman becoming public knowledge. The stories he wrote under the pen name in turn tended to be less psychological than those with his own name on them.
</li><li> This is probably part of the reason why the <em>Intrigues of the Reflected Realm</em> series by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinJarvis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinJarvis">Robin Jarvis</a> never progressed further than the first book — the complex backstory is only hinted at and requires multiple re-readings before it makes sense, plus in order to understand the plot you need to be familiar with the concept of genetic engineering, which is integral, but again, never fully explained. Being familiar with the Elizabethan idea of the four humours helps a lot as well. Bearing in mind that this is a kid's book, the result can be hopelessly confusing on first reading.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneWolfe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneWolfe">Gene Wolfe</a>
<ul><li> He is well known for leaving large amounts of his background and story as puzzles for the reader — particularly in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfTheNewSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfTheNewSun">Book of the New Sun</a> series. Important details like which characters are the lead character's close relatives and where (on earth) the story is set are left as puzzles for the reader — as are many obscure (but real) words used in the series.
</li><li> Fundamentally, the reader is sometimes left to puzzle out what <em>genre</em> the story is supposed to be: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFi">Sci-Fi</a> or Fantasy? Religious or Secular? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">The narrator himself may not know</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBaroqueCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBaroqueCycle">The Baroque Cycle</a></em> books in particular go down much smoother if the reader has an undergraduate-level comprehension of economic theory, currency trading, securities investment, shipbuilding, counterfeiting, alchemy, high-seas piracy, and a graduate-level mastery European political machinations during the Renaissance era.
</li><li> You'll get a lot more out of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDiamondAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDiamondAge">The Diamond Age</a></em> if you are already conversant with advanced concepts in nanotechnology and Asian geography.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowCrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowCrash">Snow Crash</a></em>, Stephenson pauses about halfway through to ensure that the reader is brought up to speed on essential elements of ancient Sumerian mythology and human neurological development before continuing with the plot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Anathem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Anathem">Anathem</a></em> speaks learnedly about subjects many readers may not even be able to pronounce let alone describe, including epistemology, ontology, orbital mechanics and the (theoretical) quantum-multiverse. Sensing a pattern...?
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em> — Tolkien's epic history of Middle-Earth — needs the reader to have both a photographic memory and an understanding of pre-medieval Norse / Germanic naming conventions just to keep up with the characters that were introduced hundreds of pages previously but then turn out to have a child who married the child of the child of... okay, enough of that, I personally recommend sticky notes. Lots and lots of sticky notes. There is a list of characters at the back though, along with family trees so you can see such things as how Aragorn is related to Celebrimbor.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesStross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesStross">Charles Stross</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/OneOfUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/OneOfUs">an arch-geek</a>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLaundryFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLaundryFiles">The Laundry Files</a></em> contains lots of references to Mandelbrot sets, P-complete and NP-complete equations, and a lot of other stuff that you have to have studied advanced math and the like to understand (thankfully, understanding the technobabble isn't required for enjoyment). Lampshaded early in <em>The Atrocity Archive</em> when Bob gives us an overview of computational demonology:
<div class="indent"> The [Turing] theorem is a hack on discrete number theory that simultaneously disproves the Church-Turing hypothesis (wave if you understood that)...

Martin's series is comprised of compressed paper bricks of characters, conflicts, locations, plotlines, motives, implications, deaths, twists, and revelations. There have been 24 major POV characters so far, narrating about as many distinct plotlines over half as many distinct locations, including over a hundred secondary characters. Not for the faint of attention span.
<ul><li> Reading this series can be considered a dry run for Robert Jordan's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em> — With over 140 POV characters spread over fifteen books, 10,000 pages and if you were to sit down and listen to them non-stop, just over 19 DAYS of audio. Whilst this could just be considered a colossal task on its own, any character could come back at any time, requiring readers to call back to previous books and remember what obscure phrase that was mentioned in passing could now mean in a revealing light.
</li></ul></li><li> Steven Erikson's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MalazanBookOfTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MalazanBookOfTheFallen">Malazan Book of the Fallen</a></em> is quite possibly one of the most complex works of fantasy ever written. The main storylines of the series span four continents, every one of the ten <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doorstopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doorstopper">Doorstopper</a> books has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">cast of hundreds</a>, and the series's backstory covers hundreds of thousands of years. Viewpoint characters constantly change; there is extensive and deliberate use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInMediasRes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInMediasRes">Lost in Medias Res</a>, obtuse in-world poetry used as chapter epigraphs, oblique dialogue, digressions as characters discuss or ponder philosophy, and complex prose. The first book, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GardensOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GardensOfTheMoon">Gardens of the Moon</a></em>, is infamously difficult for new readers to get into. This was done deliberately, as Erikson wanted to weed out readers without the patience to keep track of his vast numbers of characters and plot lines.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven">Larry Niven</a> expects his readers to be conversant in a basic level of physics. His character will occasionally mention some scientific principle, but will <em>never</em> explain that principle, or why it's important to the story, because they (the character) already know what it means. So when a character mentions it takes six hours to get a message because of light-speed delay, or mentions the tidal differential of a ship in orbit around a neutron star, or starts talking about a thickened gas torus in high gravity rotational environment and it confuses you, Niven expects you to do the research and keep up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HoratioHornblower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HoratioHornblower">Horatio Hornblower</a></em> is another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen">Wooden Ships and Iron Men</a> series, with extremely detailed descriptions of nautical work. Sometimes, C.S. Forester will explain a particular term or operation. But if you don't know what halyards or mizzenmasts or hawse-holes are... well, good luck. (Oh, and a working knowledge of the game of whist will help you too.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlicesAdventuresInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlicesAdventuresInWonderland">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a></em>, especially now that most of the matter that the book satirizes (particularly children's poems) are known to the vast majority of people solely through this book. <em>The Annotated Alice</em>, edited by Martin Gardner, is both useful and entertaining for modern readers.
</li><li> Mexican poet and writer Amado Nervo. If not his poems or tales, every article written by him included varying themes like theatre, opera, other writers' works, conflicts between other nations, travels and personal anecdotes lived in Paris and New York, among others. He also tended to use quotes in other languages, like English, French or even Latin, most of the time without giving a traduction of what he just said. Understandably, because back then (late 19th and early 20th century) he wrote for weekly newspapers and magazines aimed for upper-middle class cultured people, but now, when anyone can check his works, normal readers might feel this.
</li><li> Melodie Crookshank of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TyrannosaurCanyon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TyrannosaurCanyon">Tyrannosaur Canyon</a></em> is a lab geek who only interacts with one other character. Her perspective is peppered with technical names for equipment and tests as well as her interpretations of this data, with very few laymen's explanations.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PamelaDean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PamelaDean">Pamela Dean</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSecretCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSecretCountry">The Secret Country</a></em> books hold your attention even if you don't know Shakespeare, Chaucer et al., but if you do, you'll discover greater dimensions to the storyline and the characters.
</li><li> Parts of Greer Gilman's <em>Moonwise</em> and <em>Cloud &amp; Ashes</em> may be almost incomprehensible unless you know a little about English folklore and ballads and can catch onto the ancient meanings of the words she's using: <em>wood</em> once meant crazy or eccentric, a <em>crowd</em> is a fiddle, and so on. Like Clavell, she tends to explain these things <em>once</em>. She writes in double and triple meanings and has lots of fun with puns and dialects. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sfsite.com/02b/gr170.htm">She talks about it here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WitchellASymphony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WitchellASymphony">Witchell: A Symphony</a></em> has a suggested listening selection for each chapter. A great deal of the foreshadowing is in the music and in the (musical) descriptions of the characters' voices. For example, Tavin's older brother is suggested to be unallied by associating him with the piano, which can be very low (evil) or very high (good). Tavin himself is associated with the cello, solidifying him as the protagonist.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelMoorcock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelMoorcock">Michael Moorcock</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCorneliusChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCorneliusChronicles">Jerry Cornelius</a></em> series contains hundreds of obscure literary and cultural references. Moorcock claimed that he didn't expect that any reader would get them all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MARZENA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MARZENA">The MARZENA Series</a></em> itself is based on a non-fiction book called <em>Outlast the Machine</em>, which is about explaining in understandable English the most intricate mysteries of the brain, and which likely started as a master thesis that decided to switch to the dark side. Transhuman Ambrosia is very pointy on its knowledge of neuroscience, and even comes up with its own theories of how the brain works by measuring the levels of brain activity using glial cells (exchanging bananas for bananas), and goes to great length to explain what is consciousness, how the brain creates it, and how we could artificially replicate and harness that process. The amount of details is absolutely insane, and yet the book manages to keep things simplistic enough that you could just happily browse through it without realizing all the hidden scientific genius behind it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenKesey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenKesey">Ken Kesey</a> decided to write <em>Sometimes a Great Notion</em> fully in first-person. Fair enough. He decided to use multiple narrators. Also fair enough. He also decided never to explicitly tell a reader when the narrative point of view shifted. There are subtle clues, like a mention of the previous narrator in third person, but the reader has to do the work entirely for themselves. It's not as difficult as some of the other examples on this list, but it still counts.
</li><li> Unless you're quite familiar with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> stories (simply having seen film/TV adaptations won't help much) and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos">Cthulhu Mythos</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>'s short story "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AStudyInEmerald" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AStudyInEmerald">A Study in Emerald</a>" will require multiple readings to make sense. Despite this, it's one of his best loved short stories and won a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HugoAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HugoAward">Hugo Award</a>. Most of Gaiman's other work (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGods">American Gods</a></em> in particular) falls under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus">Genius Bonus</a> instead, as it will still mostly make sense if you don't have a thorough understanding of the background material (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a> in <em>American Gods</em>' case), but you'll appreciate it even more if you do.

The robot was originally called "giant" since he was compared to the rest of the characters in the setting but young readers informed author Dav Pilkey that since the setting is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MouseWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MouseWorld">Mouse World</a>, the robot isn't actually a giant and requested the name be changed to the current.

Williams claimed that a child of ten with a good understanding of language, mathematics, and astronomy would be just as likely to solve the puzzle as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Oxbridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Oxbridge">Oxbridge</a> don.

Frasier, Niles, and some of their highbrow friends frequently make reference to all manner of obscure, highbrow things, often within the subcultural worlds of opera, wine appreciation, and psychology. They're particularly fun of clever puns or sassy insults that show off their knowledge, though these can be difficult to follow for the un-elite.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a> also has <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnlyConnect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnlyConnect">Only Connect</a></em>, a game show whose theme is spotting obscure links between brief clues. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lskhg/features/quiz/">The website has some example questions<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from the hardest round of the show, which involves separating 16 clues into four groups of four and explaining the connection in each group. Against the clock, of course. The links could be anything from "fictional spacecraft" to "female British government ministers" to "words with vowels in alphabetical order" to ... well, just about anything you can think of.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QI">QI</a></em> turns it on its ear. Not only do the viewers generally not know the right answer, it's fairly rare that any of the "contestants" have any idea what's going on, even after the answer is explained. But that's kind of the point. For a show about comedians (and the odd political figure) talking about whatever happens to cross their mind, the show is extremely smart. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenFry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenFry">Stephen Fry</a> is a certified genius to begin with, then adding in questions that question common knowledge ("How many moons does the Earth have?"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note63h5t');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note63h5t" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note63h5t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It's still one, but science at the time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">classified other small, wide-orbiting bodies as moons to Earth as well, giving us officially "2", then later "4", before being reclassified so we are back to one</a></span>), <em>then</em> the fact that the comedians are often specialized geniuses themselves.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Alternative 3</em>. A British documentary series decides to have a bit of fun for April Fool's day, and claim British scientists are being taken to a secret base on Mars to protect them from a terrible disaster. Twenty years later, the show is now a central part of a great many conspiracy theories by those who failed to get the joke.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Carnivale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Carnivale">Carnivàle</a></em> had knights templar and tarot card mythology, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">obscure symbolism</a>, cultural references from the 1930s, fabulous and expensive-looking recreations of the depression-era midwest, and refusal to provide helpful exposition to the audience. It got cancelled after two seasons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>
<ul><li> The show is generally pretty straight-forward, but the Seventh Doctor story "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS26E2GhostLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS26E2GhostLight">Ghost Light</a>" is an involved meditation on the concept of evolution that probably requires two or three viewings to understand. It also uses literary and scientific allusions as a time-saving substitute for exposition. According to the DVD, "Ghost Light" had to be cut down from four episodes to three due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">the show's run being cut</a>. It's most likely that background and explanatory scenes were the first to suffer — something they might have got away with in some stories, but quite obviously didn't here.
</li><li> The <em>E-Space Trilogy</em> was, according to the DVD specials on "Full Circle," partly written to start the show including science that "wouldn't be laughed at" by legitimate scientists. This is especially true in "Warriors' Gate," which takes place in a shrinking universe at coordinate 0 and has some connection to the I-Ching and the nature of randomness. Adric's frequent coin-flipping? Yeah, it means something.
</li><li> Depending who you ask, Steven Moffat's major story arc involving River Song and the Silence is either this or just plain full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole">Plot Holes</a>. There <em>are</em> fans who insist that everything you need to know about this storyline is obvious from the show, but get them discussing it in detail and it turns out they don't agree among themselves about anything but the broadest strokes of the plot, which isn't the part that confuses people.
</li><li> Most of the 2nd half of series 7 in 2013 is this because of the show's 50th anniversary. To fully understand the plots of many of the episodes, the viewer has to relate the current arc (drawing materials from the Matt Smith years) to various plots/characters/monsters from previous doctors, which means the viewer has to know a few episodes.
</li><li> A lot of "Doctor Who" in the 1980s suffers from this, as it involved a lot of continuity which required the viewers to have a very thorough knowledge of "Doctor Who", down to stories which as major plot points, involve stories from the 1960s. This is often blamed for the decline of the show.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DoctorWhoExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DoctorWhoExpandedUniverse">Doctor Who Expanded Universe</a> is notorious for this, often requiring a very good knowledge of "Doctor Who" history for this and referencing other parts of the EU, even if it may take place in a different continuity. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/BigFinishDoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/BigFinishDoctorWho">Big Finish Doctor Who</a> can be especially hard to follow with its mass of interconnected plots in a series that started in 1999 and has released a new audio every month, not counting the bonus releases and spin-offs. Slightly justified, as the DWEU is aimed at hard-core fans.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em>, "Objects In Space".

Case in point: everyone knows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Karma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Karma">Karma</a>, but how many Americans know that "dharma" means a divine duty that leads to the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moksha">"moksha", or "letting go"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, one of the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords">Arc Words</a> and a super-critical concept in the final season?

Of course the fun of the show is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST">the riffs</a> are so frequent, you can miss one or two and still get the jokes. Their reference pool is so varied that they won a Peabody. However, they would also frequently indulge in in-jokes that <em>only</em> the writers could possibly get.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em>, at its best, combines this trope with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeekReferencePool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeekReferencePool">jokes that the average viewer might understand</a>. In one Halloween episode Leonard uses several scientific references to insult Penny's ex, which can be funny if you understand them, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> in that he didn't want <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">the guy</a> to realize he was being made fun of. Of course, this can fall flat when the writers try too hard to find a way of putting a line to qualify as a statement as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus">Genius Bonus</a>, when it really just comes across <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SesquipedalianLoquaciousness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SesquipedalianLoquaciousness">as pretentious to anyone who has even a cursory knowledge of the notion.</a>. On the latter seasons, they have fallen into reciting geek references and hoping you feel smart just because you "get it".
</li><li> Among the reasons that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PoliceSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PoliceSquad">Police Squad!</a></em> only lasted one season was that ABC thought it was guilty of this trope. According to ABC, the show required the viewer to pay too much attention in order to understand the humor. TV Guide called this "the most stupid reason a network ever gave for ending a series".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePrisoner1967" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePrisoner1967">The Prisoner (1967)</a></em>. Considering that the show only lasted one season, they managed to cram in enough esoterica that to list them here would require a separate page. And most of them happen in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">last two episodes</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesMinister">Yes, Minister</a></em> is a British comedy series about a Politician, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Obstructive Bureaucrat</a>, and a 3rd underling who answers to the second one. Even an adult who isn't well-acquainted with the detailed workings of British government, let alone a non-Brit trying to watch the series, would find himself pausing the video to look up things like "quangos" and "marginal constituencies" on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">That Other Wiki</a>.
</li><li> It is virtually impossible for a single viewer to correctly identify all of the music and pop culture references made in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilmoreGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilmoreGirls">Gilmore Girls</a></em> without looking them up. The cast would spend the majority of their readings just trying to figure out what the hell their characters were talking about, and eventually a book of "Gilmorisms" was distributed with the DVD sets to help aid curious fans.
</li><li> Some episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em>, especially Series 5. Considering it's a comedy, a lot of people would probably just brush it off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble">Techno Babble</a>.
</li><li> Tony's series 2 episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Skins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Skins">Skins</a></em> makes a lot more sense if you have a very strong understanding of Jungian psychology.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock">30 Rock</a></em> plays with this a lot. A textbook example is when Cerie mentions how she's upset her fiancé wants a Greek Orthodox wedding because she disagrees with the church's stance on Cyprus. Only viewers who are of Greek heritage or who follow international politics closely will have a clue what she's referring to.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7ggs3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7ggs3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7ggs3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAllLiveInAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAllLiveInAmerica">Or, you know, European people outside Greece.

</li><li> When the BBC first aired <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rome">Rome</a></em> they felt that British viewers already knew a lot of the Roman history and so much of the exposition was redundant. As such they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">edited the first three episodes down to just two</a> by trimming a lot of the politics scenes (without telling the director of the episodes). This is the official reasoning, though the fact that this placed much greater focus on the sex and violence may suggest the true motives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator">skewed the other way</a>.
</li><li> Occasionally showed up in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfEpisodeSilliness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfEpisodeSilliness">End-of-Episode Silliness</a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WelcomeBackKotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WelcomeBackKotter">Welcome Back, Kotter</a></em>, such as the story of one of Kotter's innumerable uncles, a tailor who had a friend he hadn't seen in years named, improbably, Euripides Feldman. One day, the story went, a man who looked like his long lost friend walked into the uncle's shop carrying a torn pair of pants. Uncle Herbie studied him a moment, then asked, "Euripides?" The other man replied, "Yes. Eumenides?"
</li><li> Understanding much of the humor in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus">Monty Python's Flying Circus</a></em> (and much of their stagework and films) might involve vast knowledge of history, art, science, politics and/or British culture and customs, and in many cases, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalPeriodPiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalPeriodPiece">a lot of topical or cultural humor</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">from the time</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">the show was first aired</a>. (1969-71) Knowing a good deal about British television and comedy shows of the day couldn't hurt, either—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhatYouKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhatYouKnow">almost all of the members of the troupe began as TV comedy writers</a>, and a great deal of the humor was spoofing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshading</a> or subverting the customs and clichés of the genre.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThroughTheWormhole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThroughTheWormhole">Through The Wormhole</a></em> can easily slip right through people's heads like a neutrino if they don't already have a strong background on science. The experts on the show try to make the concepts understandable to normal people through analogy, but this usually confuses viewers further.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackBooks">Black Books</a></em>. Bernard, to win a bet over writing a children's book in one night, writes a 1030 page book involving the Stalinist purges and a complex plot. When Manny points out this might be difficult for the 3-6 age range Bernard says "I don't think we should talk down to children."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLateShowWithStephenColbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLateShowWithStephenColbert">The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</a></em>, to more of an extent than most talk shows, anyway; Stephen makes geeky and otherwise fairly obscure allusions in his comedy and tends to assume that his audience is familiar with recent political developments, government procedures, and historical events. While he has the usual rota of celebrities promoting their latest films, he's rarely content to stick to the usual talking points, and the celebrity guests are mixed with less famous but very influential political figures (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JoeBiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JoeBiden">Joe Biden</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">Bill Clinton</a>, Stephen Breyer<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8su5l');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8su5l" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8su5l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">a Supreme Court justice</span>, and the <em>Secretary-General of the United Nations</em>) and high-level business folk, including Wall Street analyst Ben Bernanke and multiple CEOs (including those of Apple, Uber, and Airbnb).
</li><li> Quite a bit of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>'s reputation as an incomprehensible tangle is the result of people not catching on when an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus">Freeze-Frame Bonus</a> in Season 2 combines with an obscure science reference in season 3 and an unrelated conversation in season 4 to explain an event that happened in season 1. Given that this happens several times an episode, the result is a show revered by fans of complex storytelling that leaves the average viewer scratching their heads.
</li><li> For <em>assuming</em> that viewers are geniuses, or at least reasonably intelligent, look no further than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneRoddenberry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneRoddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a> endeared himself to millions of fans with this: "<em>Star Trek</em> started with the premise that the American television audience is a lot more intelligent and perceptive than the so-called 'experts' insist. We feel you can short-change that audience only at your own peril." He repeated this assertion for the rest of his life.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SchittsCreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SchittsCreek">Schitt's Creek</a></em>: Like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em> before it, the show's humor often derives from urbane people interacting with working class people and contains many silly jokes that most audience members would understand. However, the show's attention to detail, such as the Rose family wearing authentic designer clothing that was made before the Roses lost their wealth, and the way it often layers references into both plot and dialogue rewards viewers who pay careful attention and/or are keyed into various subcultures.
<ul><li> David's ex-boyfriend is a spot-on parody of a specific kind of art world hipster, and the show expects the audience to catch on to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GreyGardens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GreyGardens">Grey Gardens</a> style intentions to humiliate Moira.
</li><li> Moira is about four decades too old to play Patty Hearst and the wrong race to play Imelda Marcos, something which is never pointed out.
</li><li> Moira pitches an idea for an art park to the town council that sounds an awful lot like Donald Judd's Chinati Foundation.
</li><li> Alexis mentions that Jared Leto was her first kiss, and the character is supposed to be about two decades younger than the actor.
</li><li> David mocks Alexis's college in the following exchange:

The protagonist of the song is an astronaut who has travelled across the "milky seas" (Milky Way — the galaxy) looking for habitable planets. For the crew only one year has passed, but for Earth they have been gone so long that nearly everyone they knew is dead.

Bach</a> (a fictional composer "rediscovered" by Peter Schickele) funny, apart from the occasional slapstick bits, the listener needs an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncyclopaedicKnowledge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncyclopaedicKnowledge">Encyclopaedic Knowledge</a> of Baroque, Classical and Romantic music, as well as a grounding in music theory and scholarship. Conversely, listeners who only like classical and ignore popular music will miss many of the jazz, country, and other non classical elements Schickele sneaks in.
<ul><li> The classical quotations are far more prevalent, and often the non classical touches are no more than jazzy cadences. Even so, there are many pieces which mix both, like one of the fugues in "The Short-Tempered Clavier" which quotes both "You Are My Sunshine" and "Till Eulenspiegels lustige Streiche."
</li><li> It's not just obscure <em>music</em> he makes jokes about. In "Iphigenia in Brooklyn," Orestes appears "chased by the Amenities." Cheap laughs... Except that the Eumenides were actual Greek mythological beings more commonly known today as the Furies.
</li></ul></li><li> In order to even <em>begin</em> to understand what the death metal band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Atheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Atheist">Atheist</a> plays, one would need a working knowledge of thrash metal, jazz, progressive rock, funk, and Latin music. Try listening to "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utqWrkVEQvI">Mother Man<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" from <em>Unquestionable Presence</em> if you don't believe me.
<ul><li> To say nothing of what Psyopus and Dysrhytmia do.
<ul><li> Indeed, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIiYwKO88aY">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is by <em>far</em> one of Psyopus' most accessible songs, and it still sounds like complete aural insanity, in spite of being very much the opposite.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Meshuggah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Meshuggah">Meshuggah</a> is another good example. Enjoyment of their music almost <em>requires</em> knowledge of death / thrash metal, free jazz, progressive rock, polyrhythmic song structures, polymeters, and syncopes. Since 1993, they have produced exactly one song that relies on a consistent 4/4 timing, and are regarded as one of the most influential bands in the underground, despite having virtually nil in the way of mainstream recognition.
</li><li> <em>The Dillinger Escape Plan</em>'s first record, <em>Calculating Infinity,</em> is definitely a good example of this, although there is a notable exception in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicRiff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicRiff">main riff</a> of fan favorite, "43% Burnt," which was named by Decibel Magazine to be the 8th greatest riff of all time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gorguts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gorguts">Gorguts</a>, starting with <em>Obscura</em>, are effectively the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalDeathMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalDeathMetal">Technical Death Metal</a> version of Captain Beefheart (see below). To understand their music properly it helps to have a working knowledge of death metal, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock">Progressive Rock</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvantGardeMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvantGardeMusic">Avant-garde Music</a>, twentieth-century <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicalMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicalMusic">Classical Music</a>, and several other genres. A thorough background in music theory won't hurt either. (Bandleader Luc Lemay has acknowledged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DmitriShostakovich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DmitriShostakovich">Dmitri Shostakovich</a> and Krzysztof Penderecki as major influences on his writing, if that gives you any indication what you're in for.) To understand their lyrics, it helps to have a detailed understanding of history and various forms of mythology. Even with those under your belt, most of their albums won't even begin to make sense until you've listened to them at least ten times. They'll also be terrifying on the first several listens, even if you already have thorough familiarity with death metal.
</li><li> Similar to Gorguts (and probably influenced by them) are the French <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMetal">Black Metal</a> band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeathspellOmega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeathspellOmega">Deathspell Omega</a>. Starting with the 75-minute <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConceptAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConceptAlbum">Concept Album</a> <em>Si monumentum reqiures, circumspice</em>, the band began a highly philosophical series of concept albums filled with absurdly complex musical and lyrical concepts. If you haven't made a thorough study of Christian theology and several major schools of philosophy such as existentialism, good luck understanding their lyrics. You'll probably also need to consult a dictionary to understand the English lyrics, and working knowledge of languages like French, Latin, and German won't hurt, either. Additionally, you'll need a thorough grounding in literature in several different languages to fully understand their lyrics, including writers like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnMilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnMilton">John Milton</a>, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and <em>especially</em> Georges Bataille; they're fond of throwing in allusions to other authors' works with no indication that they are allusions, and if you don't recognise the allusions, they may make no sense whatsoever. Meanwhile, their songs, which often go on for as long as twenty-two minutes, bear little to no resemblance to traditional metal compositions. Again, working knowledge of genres like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock">Progressive Rock</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvantGardeMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvantGardeMusic">Avant-garde Music</a> and twentieth-century <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicalMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicalMusic">Classical Music</a> will help, and again, their music will be terrifying on the first several listens even if you're already familiar with black metal. The fact that "Gorguts are the new Deathspell Omega" has become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a> probably tells you all you need to know about the similarity between the two bands.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa">Frank Zappa</a> trampled this one into the dirt. His music is not only full with quotes from 20th century classical music, but also references to politics and American society, often even going into inside jokes that are incomprehensible to other people.
<ul><li> Unsurprisingly, Zappa's classmate/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">sometimes-friend</a>/protégé <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CaptainBeefheart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CaptainBeefheart">Captain Beefheart</a> created music that was at least as incomprehensible as Zappa's, not merely for the fiendishly atonal music and complex arrangements but the often surreal lyrics that often seemed to be cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordSaladLyrics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordSaladLyrics">Word Salad Lyrics</a> on the surface but often turned out to incorporate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screwy</a> metaphors about things like ecology and animal welfare. Unsurprisingly, commercial success was not forthcoming.
</li></ul></li><li> Ditto <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JethroTull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JethroTull">Jethro Tull</a>. An explanation for Jethro Tull's most lyrically complex work, the 1973 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConceptAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConceptAlbum">Concept Album</a> <em>A Passion Play,</em> can be found <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ministry-of-information.co.uk/app/index.htm">here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Subverted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronMaiden">Iron Maiden</a>, who often explain their literary and historical references in the lyrics or even the title alone. (Examples: "Rime of the Ancient Mariner," "Alexander the Great," and "The Trooper.")
<ul><li> This is more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus">Genius Bonus</a>: If you know what the Crimean War is or who Tennyson was, all the better, but if not, hey, they still have kickass melodies and you can sing along to "Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!"
</li></ul></li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DreamTheater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DreamTheater">Dream Theater</a> fans need to listen to their songs at least 3 times through to catch all the little details. Deciphering <em>Scenes from a Memory</em> could prove as a real challenge to those inexperienced to reading between the lines.
</li><li> Modernist/Postmodernist composer <em>Alfred Schnittke</em> — in order to REALLY understand his work, you really need to know classical music history, understand his own personal philosophy on music, know music theory, and it would really help if you read <em>Thomas Mann.</em>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rancid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rancid">Rancid</a>'s <em>Life Won't Wait</em> requires you to be a near expert in both music and politics. After releasing <em>...And Out Come the Wolves,</em> a largely straight ahead punk record with a little ska for good measure, <em>Life Won't Wait</em> spanned genres including reggae, dub, hip-hop, ska, rockabilly, calypso, and everything in-between. Lyrically, the band upped the prose level by about 50% and referenced everything from the minutia of the Kennedy Assassination, conflicts in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Ireland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Ireland">Ireland</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jamaica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Poland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Poland">Poland</a>, and makes numerous mentions of anarchism and other political theory, even splicing in audio readings of <em>Mikhail Bakunin</em>'s essays on anarchism. Oh and the kicker? This is the only <em>Rancid</em> album not to include a lyrics sheet, so even if you know what they're singing about, you have to be used to Tim Armstrong's marble mouthed vocals and Lars Frederiksen's snarl to get even half of it.
</li><li> Possibly the worst example of this is <em>Mohsen Namjoo,</em> an Iranian singer-songwriter, often referred to as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">Bob Dylan</a> (read: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa">Frank Zappa</a>) of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iran">Iran</a>. Western listeners would be baffled because he writes lyrics in Farsi, uses a traditional Iranian music ensemble, almost never writes in 4/4, and alludes constantly to years of Persian poetic and literary tradition. Iranian listeners are often baffled because he mixes traditional Iranian folk and classical music with Western instruments, jazz, rock, blues, and flamenco influences, covers <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOCqbyljZ6U">David Bowie<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_I4rrvSHoc">Nirvana,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> uses parodies, subversions, and references to poets such as Hafez, Rumi, and Ferdosi, makes fun of the Islamic regime and Khamenei <em>constantly,</em> and occasionally throws in the odd song in Kurdish or some other regional Iranian language.
</li><li> Electronic duo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Coil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Coil">Coil</a> filled their music with lyrical and sonic references to art, highbrow literature, pop culture, the occult, and everything in between, often in the form of highly intellectual puns and jokes (mainly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurrealHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurrealHumor">Surreal Humor</a>). At its essence, their entire catalogue is one giant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus">Genius Bonus</a>.
</li><li> Pretty much every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BadReligion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BadReligion">Bad Religion</a> album requires the use of a dictionary to understand the lyrics. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> by the <em>NOFX</em> song "I'm a Huge Fan of Bad Religion" with the lyric: "I bought <em>Suffer</em> then I bought a thesaurus."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomLehrer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomLehrer">Tom Lehrer</a> was a math professor at Harvard during his musical career. Both his songs and his commentary dealt heavily with science, history, and (then) current events. Occasionally it went over his audience's head, as in the case of a bit of banter on the live album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AnEveningWastedWithTomLehrer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AnEveningWastedWithTomLehrer">An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer</a></em>:
<div class="indent"> "I particularly remember a heartwarming novel of his about a young necrophiliac who finally achieved his boyhood ambition by becoming coroner." <br/><em>[tepid laughter]</em> <br/>"The rest of you can look it up when you get home."
</div></li><li> The music of <em>Pep Lab.</em> Listing the references is left as an exercise.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDecemberists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDecemberists">The Decemberists</a> tend to do this as do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM">R.E.M.</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDivineComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDivineComedy">The Divine Comedy</a>'s songs are about anything Neil Hannon is interested in. Which could be <em>anything:</em> Wordsworth's poems, 20th-century French cinema, stories by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FScottFitzgerald" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FScottFitzgerald">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a>, architecture, and landscape gardening... All liberally bespattered with quotations from literature, mythological allusions, and musical tips of the hat to Noel Coward and Scott Walker. Also, upbeat songs about hayfever, banking, and traveling by long distance coach.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tool">tool</a>'s music, while enjoyable to a casual listener, is often laden with polyrhythms, uncommon time signatures ("Schism," anybody?), and several songs deal with themes such as Transcendentalism, Jungian psychology, religion, abuse, and really run the whole gamut lyrically. Take a look at the guitar tabs; they might not sound impressive, but Adam Jones is a more "technical" musician.
<ul><li> And then you get into their "jigsaw arrangements." <em>10,000 Days</em> contains a song that is made by constructing three different songs and <em>Lateralus</em> has an entirely different song order that completely changes the meaning of the album.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pavement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pavement">Pavement</a>'s "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anyvPX0NjFk">Conduit for Sale<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" is about the end of the House of Savoy's rule in Turin. Yeah.
<ul><li> And to think that all that most people ever remember is "I'm tryin'..."
<ul><li> To be fair, the rest of the lyrics are a good example of Stephen Malkmus' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth">Motor Mouth</a>. It's not surprising that the song falls into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingSomethingLeonardBernstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingSomethingLeonardBernstein">Something Something Leonard Bernstein</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The third movement of <em>Luciano Berio</em>'s <em>Sinfonia</em> takes a movement from a Mahler symphony and layers on top of it musical quotations from composers as diverse as Ravel, Beethoven, Bach, and Boulez. Some of them are very famous, some of them not so much. The piece is often cited as using the widest array of musical techniques of any piece of classical music. It would take an encyclopedic knowledge of classical music to understand all of them, but it's well worth it. Complicating matters is the fact that singers also sometimes recite passages from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelBeckett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelBeckett">Samuel Beckett</a> novel, read graffiti from the May 1968 protests in France, or turn a musical allusion into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">Incredibly Lame Pun,</a> among other things.
<ul><li> Other movements continue the Mahler references and cut up sections of Claude Levi-Strauss's classic anthropological text <em>The Raw and the Cooked.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> To understand Schoenberg / Berg/ Webern's 12-tone atonal serialism (where all 12 notes in the western chromatic scale have to be used in a composer determined order before repeating), you pretty much have to study it, which in Western Music Theory, usually comes around the fourth semester. Complete with a 144 square matrix of all possible orders of notes. It's quite unsettling to the ear for many people, although others enjoy it.
<ul><li> It's also very difficult to play.
</li><li> The Second Viennese School (the group started by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArnoldSchoenberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArnoldSchoenberg">Arnold Schoenberg</a> most noted for 12-tone compositions) also liked to demonstrate the power of their system by creating some traditionally pleasant sounding pieces. One of these was Berg's Violin Concerto, which includes a quotation from a Bach harmonization of a hymn and another from a Carinthian folk song.
</li></ul></li><li> To an even greater extent, Milton Babbitt took it to the extreme (serializing all notes, volume, and length of note), to the point where EVERYTHING has a formula, and it would take about an hour just get around a 1-minute piece of his music.
</li><li> So, you want to start deciphering the plots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SoundHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SoundHorizon">Sound Horizon</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConceptAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConceptAlbum">Concept Albums</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockOpera">Rock Operas</a>? Well, better learn six languages and start scrutinizing Every. Single. Lyric. for a potential double meaning.
</li><li> Most of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IanDury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IanDury">Ian Dury</a>'s lyrics. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> in the sense that they appear intelligent (and for all intents and purposes ARE intelligent on more than a handful of levels) but Dury wrote for the common man so expected everyone to understand at least <em>something.</em> Don't expect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexDrugsAndRockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexDrugsAndRockAndRoll">catch on</a> though...

<div class="indent"> If you can't take the heat, eject / But I know you can because you're an Ice-T fan"
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson">Marilyn Manson</a> might not be assumed to be someone who does obscure references, but yeah, he does. About five people will understand "Slo-Mo-Tion" without having things explained. Lyrics about dead audience applause and laughter and "teenage rape candidates" likely will be completely lost on anyone who doesn't know that the canned laughter and applause used nowadays was recorded in the 1950's or about casting couch accusations. "Overneath the Path of Misery"'s chorus is a Greek mythology reference. The song "Lamb of God" contains references to the death of John Lennon, JFK, and Jesus as well as a spoiler reference to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Network" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Network">Network</a>. The album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MechanicalAnimals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MechanicalAnimals">Mechanical Animals</a></em> is a huge shout out to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a>. There are references to the Waco, Texas incident in "Cruci-Fiction in Space." The song "My Monkey" has lyrics taken from a song on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesManson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesManson">Charles Manson</a>'s album from the 1960's. Multiple songs, like "Kinderfeld" and "Lunchbox" are about his own life, and "Fuck Frankie" is directed at their old tour manager, Frankie, who stole tens of thousands of dollars from them. "s(AINT) contains references to the origin of the word "Ain't," which was British "dandy" slang originally. And after the release of the album <em>The Golden Age of Grotesque,</em> he tried to do a film about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LewisCarroll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LewisCarroll">Lewis Carroll</a>. When a leaked trailer killed it, well, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">Creator Breakdown</a> is quite obvious, due to the Alice obsession oozing out of some parts of <em>Eat Me, Drink Me,</em> not to mention the entirely different sound. Basically, half the stuff that makes no sense to most is references to other things, and rest was written by either one person on drugs (him) or two (him and Twiggy).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JonathanCoulton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JonathanCoulton">Jonathan Coulton</a>'s music is fully of computer / technology, math, physics, and pop-culture references. For example, how many people (even in New York City) knew that Soterios Johnson was a real (and ostensibly famous) person? (Unless you were a WNYC listener. Used to be their morning announcer and local anchor for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NPR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NPR">NPR</a>'s Morning Edition. Teaches at UC Davis now.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PattiSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PattiSmith">Patti Smith</a>'s entire career is based on this. You don't notice because she's also rocking your ass off at the same time. Her prose writing is the same way; beautifully accessible <em>and</em> stuffed to the gills with art, literary, mythological, and musical references.
</li><li> Seminal Scottish post-punk band (the) Scars released a single in 1979 called "Horrorshow", that relies on one having previously either watched the film of or read the book of Anthony Burgess's <em>Clockwork Orange</em>, as the song title indicates. The band, as short-lived as they may have been, were very literary-minded and supremely precocious (being a band of <em>teenagers</em>) and assumed their fans/listeners would be as well.

The intention was presumably to make WCW's dwindling audience think that Nash was talking about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart">Bret Hart</a>, since, apparently, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools">Bret's the only wrestler to come out of Canada and/or the only Canadian wrestler who had ever refused to lose a match to someone.</a> In fact, Nash was most likely referring to Pierre Carl Ouelette, who had been a 3x <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wrestling-titles.com/wwe/wwe-world-t.html">WWE World Tag Team Champion<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> as a member of the Quebecers w/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JacquesRougeau" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JacquesRougeau">Jacques Rougeau</a> in 1993-1994, but, aside from a meaningless cup of coffee with the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wrestling-titles.com/wcw/wcw-hc.html">WCW Hardcore Title<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, had not been involved in anything particularly relevant in years.
</li><li> One wrestling critic noted that Russo's problem was that he seemed to simultaneously believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons">Viewers Are Morons</a> and Viewers are Geniuses.
</li><li> It gets worse. Russo wrote for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling">TNA</a>, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">Ric Flair</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffJarrett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffJarrett">Jeff Jarrett</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting">Sting</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EricBischoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EricBischoff">Eric Bischoff</a> were all prominent talent. So, naturally, the focus of the main event TNA storyline is the "shadow politics" that were going on in WCW. Meaning, not only did you have to be a smark to know what's going on, you had to have been a smark FOR OVER 10 YEARS. And even then, there were bound to be references you didn't get, considering they're talking about everything up to and including private drunken phone calls from years ago. And no, none of this makes for halfway compelling, or even coherent, television.
</li><li> Russo believes that "all viewers are Smarks," and as far as his opinion goes, a smark is a moron who believes they're a genius. If you think of his logic this way, his entire career is basically spent in a massive attempt to outsmart the smarks. Unfortunately, the only real way to trick people in a story where they usually already know, at the very least, half of what's going to happen before it happens is to make the story incomprehensible with obscurities and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve">inexplicable plot twists</a>.
</li><li> Of course, Russo likely believes he <em>himself</em> is a genius, even when almost everyone else thinks he's a moron.
</li></ul></li><li> WWE commentator Matt Striker slips a <em>ton</em> of obscure references into his commentary. Most are designed so that they are bonuses for the hardcore fans, such as referencing past names that wrestlers have used. Sometimes, though, he goes for extremely obscure comments such as saying that Ghanian wrestler <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KofiKingston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KofiKingston">Kofi Kingston</a> will be bringing his title back home to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PrinceNana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PrinceNana">Prince Nana</a> (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a> manager who is the ruler of Ghana in that promotion's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">Kayfabe</a>).

Naturally, the WWE was originally promoting him as a smarter than you, high coulter European. Eventually, they decided to put him in the Real Americans stable, which is led by Zeb Colter. Smart marks know that Zeb Colter is played by Dutch Mantel, which prompted JBL to say: "Antonio Cesaro speaks five languages. And now thanks to Zeb, he's learning Dutch."

<ul><li> <em>Eyepiece</em>, a play in Iowa City. If you're familiar with Shakespearian plays, Greek comedies, Modernistic plays (<em>Death of a Salesman</em>), postmodern plays (<em>Waiting for Godot</em>), puns, metaphor, pataphor, medical terminology, Greek culture, theater culture, "disabled" culture, Christian culture/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">the Bible</a>, and for one particular scene the origins of Fascism and the real meaning of the word "faggot" (A bundle of burnt sticks that had been used to burn an offering), and you're observant, then the play will seem perfectly straightforward and understandable. If not, well, certain scenes will seem rather obscure.
</li><li> <em>Hamilton</em> is overflowing with references to other rap/hip-hop music and other Broadway shows, not to mention the subtle history puns like "I never thought I'd live past twenty/Where I come from some get half as many"—sung by the guy on the 10 dollar bill.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomStoppard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomStoppard">Tom Stoppard</a>'s play <em>Hapgood</em> initially flopped because so much of the plot exposition is contained within one character's metaphorical double-speak about Quantum Physics. The re-write makes the metaphors easier to understand even if you've never heard of quantum physics, and the plot significance is better signposted. Many people can treat it as a straightforward who's-the-defector spy mystery, missing the revelation (in the first act, in another rambling metaphorical monologue) of who the bad guy is and the idea that the rest of the play is about how they prove it, not about finding out.
<ul><li> In fact, Tom Stoppard continually walks the line on this trope, and most of his (theatrical) work can be argued to be either refreshingly intelligent and stimulating, or purposefully obscure and elitist.
<ul><li> Although he flips it around in <em>Rock 'N Roll</em>, which makes a lot more sense and has more emotional impact if the audience knows a good deal about '60s counterculture and rock music, specifically Pink Floyd.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BertoltBrecht" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BertoltBrecht">Bertolt Brecht</a> is perhaps the only playwright in history who considers a piece with a character named Swiss Cheese to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a>. If an audience is unfamiliar with his <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verfremdungseffekt">Verfremdungseffekt<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, they're likely to be lost from the first line onward. That said, many of Brecht's plays were comprehensible in their day, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheThreepennyOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheThreepennyOpera">The Threepenny Opera</a> was a major commercial success in Germany and abroad.
</li><li> Many stage musicals with music and lyrics by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StephenSondheim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StephenSondheim">Stephen Sondheim</a> have this criticism levelled at them. Sondheim and his collaborators avoid pat sentimentality and create complex works of art — perhaps a setback when many audience members are expecting <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheSoundOfMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheSoundOfMusic">The Sound of Music</a></em>. Just a few examples:
<ul><li> <em>Company</em> is a mediation on contemporary marriage. The show has no plot and reduces character empathy to an absolute minimum; instead, it explores different aspects of marriage through a series of non-linear vignettes and songs. There's an emotional and intellectual journey to be had, but it requires the audience to really invest themselves in the material and pay attention.
</li><li> <em>Pacific Overtures</em> is a historical pageant detailing the opening of Japan to the West in the late 1800's. Again, personal involvement is kept to a minimum, and the events are viewed through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">purposefully biased Japanese perspective</a>. The score includes a 9-minute mini-opera detailing American, British, Dutch, Russian and French trading treaties with Japan, and a 7-minute Taoist meditation about observation and memory in which <em>nothing happens</em>.
</li><li> <em>Sunday In The Park With George</em>, despite its minimalist, Britten-like score, can still be enjoyed as a classic tale of an artist (Georges Seurat) who alienates his lover for the sake of his art. Until the end of Act I, at which point the action fast-forwards <em>a whole century</em> to focus on contemporary installation artist George, great-grandson of the original. Repeated viewings help tease out the direct, micro- and macrocosmic parallels between the two Acts to make the whole work serve as a treatise on art and posterity.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SomethingRotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SomethingRotten">Something Rotten</a></em> contains rapid-fire streams of references to other musicals in songs like "A Musical" as well as the titular song. Theatre-goers unfamilliar with the last fifty years of musical theatre may find little more than dick jokes left for them after so many references fall flat.

Some parts of the plot were explained in later games, but those were the <em>simple</em> parts, not the parts involving Raiden as a deconstructive metaphor of the relationship between player and game, or the parts where the plot deconstructs itself to examine the game's nature as a sequel. <em>Those</em> were not explained at all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em> have a rather literal take on this in the form of various pop quizzes throughout the game. They tend to ask you random trivia facts about math, grammar, science, philosophy or Japanese history. Answering correctly gives you a permanent bonus to a particular out of combat stat. There is nothing in the game that tells you the answers, so you have to use your own real-world knowledge (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">or cheat</a>). There are also midterms where you get a whole bunch of these in a row, but the midterms are composed entirely out of questions that they've already asked you so if you had been paying attention it should be simple to answer.
<ul><li> To clarify the original point that was being made, the first time you are asked the questions, when they aren't on the test, they don't give you the answers. It's when the test rolls around that you should already know the answer.
</li><li> The social link's tarot classifications show a shade of this. This comes from the fact that the dev team has produced one of the few instances where they did do the research on the actual meaning behind the major arcana of the Rider-Waite tarot deck. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> eventually tells the player some of the definitions of the various Arcana about 2/3 of the way through the game, in a long speech many would speed through without reading. Even if a player read the whole speech, most of the given interpretations only scratch the topmost layer of each social link. All the social links become a lot more meaningful if you have any sort of in depth knowledge of the major arcana.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a> franchise as a whole really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">does its research</a> on world mythologies and religion. Your average player might be confused as to why Lucifer and Satan are two separate entities, and why you can find the latter chilling out with YHWH (<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragrammaton">the true name of God in Judaism<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) in <em>Shin Megami Tensei 2</em>...unless they know or find out that in certain interpretations, Satan is a separate character who basically acts as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAngelBadAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAngelBadAngel">the devil on God's shoulder.</a>

</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myst">Myst</a></em> game is like this. You're given no instructions, backstory or reason why you're on a lush yet deserted island, or even what you're supposed to be doing. This actually adds to the immersion of the game, as it encourages you to behave as you would if you inexplicably found yourself on the island in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, and figure it out for yourself.

It also helps to have a working understanding of the subtleties of how sign language works as a medium of communication and how it differs from spoken language.

The first time a puzzle involving it comes up, you're given the chance to work everything out yourself, without the game even explaining how hexadecimals work. Although, if you need it, the game does give you a run down on the basics of it. However, there's a number of times when hexadecimals come up later on in the game after this point: At these moments you're expected to remember everything you learnt about it. If you don't, then you'll be forced to either go back and refresh yourself on it by starting a new playthrough, or research it yourself. Or just try everything until you eventually get it by luck.

<ul><li> Comic number 338, a challenging comic. Apparently some readers complained that the comic wasn't challenging enough, so the author made a challenging comic. The text of the comic required people to translate Bahasa Indian, convert RGB values to ASCII characters, search the HTML source for a linked page, and be able to crack text ciphers. This was invoked though, and the author offered prizes for correct answers. Once all the correct answers were submitted, they posted a deciphered version for the non-genius readers.
</li><li> Comic number 500, titled "The book of woo", was based off of the Voynich manuscript. The author developed a custom set of symbols and text cipher for both English and German. Again invoked, there is a standing offer of cash prize for a correct translation. No one had managed it yet, And the page was posted 2013.

<div class="indent"><strong>Peter:</strong> Yeah, that's what they said about Benjamin Disraeli! <br/>(<em>Cut to Disraeli working in an office, when he suddenly looks up and glares at the camera</em>) <br/><strong>Disraeli:</strong> You don't even know who I am!
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> frequently relies on political history, much of which you would have to have studied the subject to know about. Roger (and to a lesser extent Greg and Terry) will also drop some references that you have to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> of gay culture and icons to understand.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, particularly the first ten years or so, managed to do this from time to time while still managing to be hilarious to most people who didn't get the more obscure references. Indeed the show has a considerable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewatchBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewatchBonus">Rewatch Bonus</a> for younger people who come back and catch the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus">Genius Bonus</a> that passed them by on first viewing.
<ul><li> The show's characterization is so strong a lot of viewers will laugh at jokes despite not completely grasping the subtleties of the underlying gag. For instance, Lionel Hutz hastily changing the punctuation on his business card from saying "Works on contingency — No money down" to "Works on contingency<strong><span>?</span></strong> — No<strong><span>,</span></strong> money down<strong><span>!</span></strong>" is funny simply as evidence of Hutz' shamelessness, even if you don't know what a lawyer working on a contingency basis is.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>'s writing staff had a combined 3 PHDs and 7 master's degrees, so it's only natural that they slipped in references to their fields of expertise from time to time. Topics such as mathematics, physics, and computer programming pop up from time to time in one-shot visual gags or dialogue. One DVD bonus feature had a mathematics "lecture" pointing out and explaining some of them. The writers also created two "alien" languages to be displayed in the show; reportedly, viewers were able to decipher these within 24 hours of first being shown. Taking the cake is an episode in which one of the writers slipped in his then-unsubmitted complete doctoral thesis in mathematics. In other words, that episode had the writer resolve its conflict by <em>finding the answer to a previously unsolvable math problem</em>.
</li><li> It's debatable whether or not it's a "gross overestimation" of the viewers' intelligence given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a>, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em> regularly references things like quantum theory and existentialism, throws words like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SesquipedalianLoquaciousness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SesquipedalianLoquaciousness">sesquipedalian</a> around and makes occasional (full) use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaymansTerms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaymansTerms">Layman's Terms</a>. The creators once commented on this; it went along the lines of "We make the show for ourselves but don't exclude anybody from the enjoyment."
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> (but still childish) sequel of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10">Ben 10</a></em> series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10UltimateAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10UltimateAlien">Ultimate Alien</a></em> makes accurate statements about biological structures and Darwin's natural selection theory when talking about the alien's artificial evolution and their DNA database system. Psychological issues, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome">Stockholm Syndrome</a> and personality disorders, are also current, though in a much lighter way due to the TV ratings. The series also references characters and lines from Greek and Hebrew myths, H.P. Lovercraft's books, and Richard Lovelace's poems, alongside other pop culture elements, the most (in)famous being the character Will Harangue, a journalist whose show is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrankensteinsMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrankensteinsMonster">Frankenstein's Monster</a> of various Fox News programs and a spoof of "Steven Colbert's Colbert Nation".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> often assumes that its target audience is a lot more familiar with Asian languages, mythology and history than the average 9-year-old is likely to be. This is probably what makes it so popular with college students.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em> constantly made references to older literature and short stories, stuff that only someone who read a lot would know, and unlike most shows aimed at teenagers, it never assumed that the audience was stupid.
</li><li> Full understanding of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></em> requires a game-show contestant's depth of knowledge in pop-cultural history, which many children at the time lacked.
<ul><li> A fitting example would be the song entitled "When You're Traveling From Nantucket to Saint Paul." It's all about the relativity of time, our planet's closeness to the sun and when you'd arrive if you took a plane from one place to another. The difference is that the trio does not expect to be understood as evidenced by certain lyrics. Examples include:
<div class="indent"><strong>Yakko and siblings:</strong> Time Is relative, dependent <br/>You can save it, you can spend it <br/>Doing things you like to do or learning how. <br/>You can't see it, you can't taste it <br/>But you certainly can waste it <br/>Which is really what we're doing here right now!
</div></li><li> The last stanza of the song seals the deal even further:
<div class="indent"><strong>Yakko and siblings:</strong> So remember, when you're traveling <br/>From Nantucket to St. Paul <br/>In that airport as you're staring <br/>At those clocks upon the wall <br/>You should think about this song, my friend <br/>And then you will recall... <br/>That it was mildly amusing <br/>But then totally confusin <br/>And we bet you wish we never sung at all!
</div></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer">Archer</a></em> often turns on a dime between sex jokes and references to obscure historical figures.
<div class="indent"><strong>Archer</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhGodWithTheVerbing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhGodWithTheVerbing">Oh, God, with the curry again</a>. This shirt smells like Indira Gandhi's thong.
</div><ul><li> Particularly in the earlier seasons, there would often be one character making obscure references that are funny with the requisite knowledge, then they would lampshade how unlikely anyone was to get the reference, making it more palatable for non-geniuses.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Archer</strong>: I would prefer not to... <em>(enemies cock their guns)</em> Bartleby the Scrivener? Anybody? Not a big Melville crowd here. Eh, he's not an easy read.

Quite often, some character will behave in a certain way that doesn't make sense unless you already know the animal that character is based on really does act like that in similar circumstances. This may have been the reason the show was not as popular as it could have been. Luckily for its target audience, this was heavily toned down by the time the team did <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LittlestPetShop2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LittlestPetShop2012">Littlest Pet Shop (2012)</a></em>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9i303');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9i303" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9i303');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though it does happen from time to time—Pepper, a skunk, starts spraying recklessly and runs out within several seconds in "Books &amp; Covers," which feels like an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a> unless you know that skunks really CAN run out that quickly.</span>

Beth responds, "If it were, you could call me <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErnestHemingway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErnestHemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>!"

Naturally, Jerry doesn't get it.

Some of the clues include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeClosingCredits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeClosingCredits">cryptograms in the credits,</a> backwards messages, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus">details hidden in the background.</a> Creator Alex Hirsch has said that he did this so that if anyone was as weird as him, they would find what they're looking for. Regarding the cryptograms, Season 2's is written in a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen&lt;!--C3--&gt;A8re_cipher">Vigenère cipher<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, an encoding process regarded as impenetrable for hundreds of years and which remains extremely difficult to break even in the present day without a key or a computer decryption program. Thankfully, said key is hidden within the episode, both as a word or phrase spoken by the characters and as text hidden within the background.
<ul><li> The best known example of this is when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Grunkle Stan rescued his twin brother, the author of the journals, from another dimension. Fans had guessed this twist nearly two years in advance of the episode's initial airing.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> first season episode "Damien" was about the final confrontation between Jesus and Satan. Early in the episode Damien proves his power by turning Kenny into a duck-billed platypus. The boys go to visit Jesus as he's training, and ask him if he will cure Kenny if he wins. Jesus gets indignant and says: "what do you mean IF I win?" This is a reference to an incident that only occurs in the Gospel of Mark, where Jesus gets angry when someone asks him to cure his daughter "if he can".

USB sticks were left at the toilets during/after shows, containing music/audio files (which were different on different USB sticks) then when run through a spectrogram, revealed images and, in one case, a phone number which you could call to hear a new song. Also, there were t-shirts where the highlighted letters formed the words "I am trying to believe", which turned out to be a registered domain name, while the rest of the sites were simply in the same IP range.

</li></ul></li><li> Now-disgraced BBC presenter Stuart Hall was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransAtlanticEquivalent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransAtlanticEquivalent">British counterpart</a> of Denis Miller. His football commentaries on BBC radio were classics of literacy, fluency and verbal gymnastics, which deservedly won him many fans and admirers.
</li><li> Wikipedia articles on even slightly technical topics tend towards assuming that the reader has at least a degree in the relevant field.
</li><li> Anything ever produced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheFiresignTheatre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheFiresignTheatre">The Firesign Theatre</a>. Once described by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams">Robin Williams</a> as the audio equivalent of a Hieronymous Bosch painting, and you're always looking for the little man who's coming out of the ass of a chicken. If you think you even got all of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/TheFurtherAdventuresOfNickDanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/TheFurtherAdventuresOfNickDanger">The Further Adventures of Nick Danger</a>" the first time, for example, you are probably wrong.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ARG/MITMysteryHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ARG/MITMysteryHunt">MIT Mystery Hunt</a>. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a>, puzzles have involved "arcane or esoteric topics like quantum computing, stereoisomers, ancient Greek, Klingon, Bach preludes, coinage of Africa, and Barbie dolls". And that's not even getting into the actual <em>steps</em> required to solve the puzzles.
</li><li> The University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt, affectionately known as Scav is similar. To complete many of the items on the list you need to already have a working knowledge of odd subfields that can include physics, cooking, a particular website or even certain languages.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PattonOswalt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PattonOswalt">Patton Oswalt</a> often lampshades this; he'll make a reference to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a> (or something), then lambaste himself for going over the audience's heads, then start coming up with even more obscure references, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurMachen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurMachen">Arthur Machen</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankBelknapLong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankBelknapLong">Frank Belknap Long</a>.
</li><li> Comedian Daniel Tosh stated that one of his gimmicks is wearing a single joke on and on "until only six people have a clue what [he's] talking about."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieIzzard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieIzzard">Eddie Izzard</a> mixes obscure history and references to science and philosophy into his stand-up, and goes so far as to conduct an entire 5 minute sketch in French, in front of American and British audiences. He even lampshades this last bit, telling the audience that they don't understand anything he's saying, and are only laughing because French sounds funny
</li><li> Some aspects of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes">TV Tropes</a> aren't exactly newcomer friendly. For instance, some tropes, trope names, and even rules of this wiki can be confusing to some people. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RenamedTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RenamedTropes">This is also the reason why several tropes have their names changed.</a> As an example, the trope "Dropped A Bridget On Him" had its name changed to the (admittedly less creative) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsettlingGenderReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsettlingGenderReveal">Unsettling Gender Reveal</a>, largely because people who have never heard of the meme or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear">Guilty Gear</a></em>, where the meme comes from, would possibly have no clue what that trope is about until they open it. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanMyopia">Fan Myopia</a>.
</li><li> William F Buckley Jr's essays, and show, was loaded with this, along with several helpings of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SesquipedalianLoquaciousness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SesquipedalianLoquaciousness">Sesquipedalian Loquaciousness</a>. He tended to include Spanish, French, Latin, and wildly obscure English in his essays, which were generally high-minded "plane of ideas" type pieces about public policy and the theory thereof. Try watching his show Firing Line. If you drift off for a second or aren't well-versed in interventionism, the Federal Reserve, US education, and sexual morality, have fun figuring out what's happening.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PBS">PBS</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NPR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NPR">NPR</a> are well-known for catering to educated audiences.
