</div></div><p>Insurance is a method of sharing the risk of loss between a large number of people. When someone suffers a loss, they are reimbursed by their insurance, paid for from the premiums of all the insureds who didn't suffer a loss. While it may seem that the lossee has "hit the jackpot" in that they're the only one who have got more out of their insurance than they put in, the principle of indemnity dictates that they are reimbursed only the value of their loss. Ideally, insurance pays to get you exactly back where you started, no more, no less.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Of course, people looking for a quick buck have tried all kinds of schemes to try and make a profit off insurance. A number of different techniques include:
</p><ul><li> Falsifying a loss, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingAndEntering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingAndEntering">faking a burglary</a>, hiding the "stolen goods" and then claiming their value from insurance.
</li><li> Deliberately causing a loss, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieryCoverup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieryCoverup">burning down</a> an old building to claim the money needed to build a new one
</li><li> Exaggerating the scale of a loss, such as claiming the worthless old paintings lost in a fire were actually valuable artworks. In particular, claiming exaggerated injuries from an accident (which is known as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StagedPedestrianAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StagedPedestrianAccident">Staged Pedestrian Accident</a> when it has also been deliberately caused) either to claim on the insurance or to sue the person allegedly responsible
</li><li> Waiting until you incur a loss before buying insurance, then claiming that the loss took place during the policy period
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> Lying about details which would prevent you from filing a claim, eg. who was driving the car or where the loss took place.
</li><li> Outright murdering a relative with life insurance. Bonus point if they try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident">Make It Look Like an Accident</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideNotMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideNotMurder">Killing yourself but making it look like an accident or murder</a> to secure the money for your family (can be done by either the dead person themselves or as a coverup by the beneficiary). Or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead">faking your death</a> for the same purpose.
</li><li> Combinations of these, e.g. someone files a claim for workers' compensation, and (1) aren't injured (a complete scam) (2) are not injured enough to be unable to work, e.g. if you get a paper cut it means you get a bandage and maybe a tetanus shot, it does not mean you can't use your hand; (overclaiming) (3) if you were injured but you stay off work long after actually healing (malingering).
</li></ul><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>A common plot involves characters attempting to pull off an insurance fraud and either succeeding or having to deal with the consequences of being found out. Alternatively, the insurance company may be depicted as doing its best to prove a claim false, even going so far as to plant evidence, in order to void the policy.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend">Urban Legend</a>: A guy insures his cigars, smokes them, then tries to claim the insurance money for "destruction in a fire".
<ul><li> Usually the judge rules in the guy's favor, but in some versions the insurance company has him arrested for arson.
</li><li> Raising the question of why a judge would order an insurance company to pay out, knowing that policies explicitly don't cover the owner's intentional destruction of the property.
</li><li> This turns up in an Italian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse">Uncle Scrooge</a> story. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Rockerduck</a> insures a box of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsCuban" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsCuban">Havana cigars</a> for a ridiculous sum against fire. However, Scrooge notes that the insurance deal directly says that if the fire is <em>deliberate</em> there will be no payout. He is still worried when Rockerduck stores the cigars in a place that is a horrible firetrap. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a> points out that the cigars aren't insured against <em>theft</em> - not realising that this will, of course, make Scrooge force him to steal them. While trying to do so, Donald succeeds in starting a fire...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BradPaisley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BradPaisley">Brad Paisley</a> has <em>The Cigar Song</em> which also tells this story. The insurance pays the claim, but at the end there is an investigation which results in the smoker being thrown in jail for "24 separate counts of arson."
</li></ul></li><li> There's a joke where some retired businessmen start talking about how their business was going belly up when a disaster destroyed it, allowing them to collect on insurance and retire. The first few name the disaster as something potentially man-made (fire, burst water main, etc). The last one names a natural disaster (earthquake, tornado, etc). Then the businessmen who went first ask the last guy how he arranged that.
</li><li> Another joke has a man getting fire insurance on his home. After he signs everything, the agent reminds him that he can't set fire to the place and try to claim insurance on that. The man mutters that he should've known there was a catch.

<ul><li> Partly because it's explained as being "like a bet that the Broken Drum won't get burned down"...
</li><li> And partly because the guy selling the insurance thought the Broken Drum was worth 200 solid gold coins (enough to buy half of the city, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyForeigner">Funny Foreigner</a> selling the insurance wasn't aware of that).

Encyclopedia comes up with the idea of making up a crime for them to solve, which involves a store owner claiming his store was robbed of a valuable diamond necklace - the solution reveals it was a glass duplicate that was stolen, and his intention was to defraud his store and his business partner for the insurance money.

Incensed, the husband kills the wife, burying her in the front garden. The investigator comes along the next day to announce he's calling it quits and congratulate the husband and, in an effort to show bygones are bygones, proceeds to help the horrified husband with planting his roses.

<ul><li> In one episode a serial arsonist is on the loose. Mr. Kotterman, owner of a liquor store which gets repeatedly robbed, decides to use this as an opportunity to torch his store for the insurance. Unfortunately for him, just as he arrives at the 12th Precinct (to use as his alibi when the fire occurs) he discovers that the arsonist has been caught; so he quickly exits the place in order to stop the fire.
</li><li> In another episode a furrier has one of his trucks hijacked, fills out an insurance report, and looks singularly unenthused when the merchandise is recovered. The thief scoffs at his estimate when caught, calling the furs "worthless".
</li><li> A third episode features a bus crash following a robbery attempt. Of the three witnesses, two refuse to testify while the third, who was injured in the crash, claims to have not seen anything. When further pressed, the "injured" man is discovered to have gotten on the bus <em>after</em> it crashed to claim the insurance money.

It's almost always played for tragedy, since the CSIs uncovering the true nature of the situations almost always means that someone made the ultimate sacrifice for nothing.
<ul><li> In one episode a man suffering financial difficulties fakes his suicide to look like a hunting accident so that his wife will still receive his life insurance.
</li><li> Another episode had an old woman crash her car in an attempt to have her son get the insurance money as well as get payback on the HMO that denied her money to have her cancer treated (she had tried to crash the car into her offices but she punched in the wrong address on her GPS and crashed into a restaurant instead).
</li><li> Another man lost his mentally handicapped ward's savings in a casino and tried to fake getting stabbed in the back.
</li><li> The fourth-season episode "Suckers," for a change, features an insurance fraud scam which does not involve a suicide, or any dead bodies at all: a casino hosts a (completely fraudulent) exhibit of Japanese artifacts as a cover for an equally staged robbery. It would probably have gone off flawlessly if the casino's owner hadn't had the actors he hired to put on the faux "exhibit" leave behind a bunch of paper money bands as "proof" that they'd stolen ten million dollars in cash. Notably, the casino owner seems ready to skirt on any criminal charges as the CSIs can't prove anything...only for Grissom to say he's given his findings to the insurance company who don't need full evidence so "I wouldn't be waiting for a check."
</li><li> Another one, a middle aged couple faked a <em>murder</em>. They pretend that one of them was annoyed by the electrician working next door and have him 'murdered' by messing with the electrical fuses and get him electrocuted. Turns out, the real target is their own nephew who was in the area when it happened just so that they could claim his life insurance. The electrician is just a coverup for them for committing murder so that they look like murdering him instead of their nephew and that his death just appear to be an unintended collateral damage. The investigators were suspicious at the start that they were apparently too honest for murderers.

Strangely enough, the policy in question even applies to suicides (including faked ones). In the end, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> seems to get away with it by leaving no trail from the underling who actually did the murders, only to be killed by the brother of one of his victims. One would think that Horatio might possibly drag his feet in looking for the jerk's killer.

<ul><li> A second season episode turned out to involve a less-than-competent plastic surgeon and his partner staging a random attack in the middle of a crowd at Grand Central Station in order to collect the $10 million his hands were insured for. The attack turned fatal when the partner was jostled and the lye being poured on his hand splashed into his face.
</li><li> A later episode had a couple of women taking in homeless men and then taking out life insurance policies on them, claiming to be their fiancees. Once the policies had been in effect long enough to collect the full amount, they'd kill the unsuspecting victims.

</li><li> In a fourth season episode, the team causes a corrupt cash for gold business to be arrested for insurance fraud after using a drill that the business owners bought as part of a decoy con to be used against them in a heist of their gold. Even better is the team don't even bother calling the cops; instead the marks themselves do it and when they report their gold stolen from a useless vault with a drill they bought, the officer literally laughs "that's the worst insurance fraud story I've heard" as he arrests them.
</li><li> One episode is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RashomonStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RashomonStyle">"Rashomon"-Style</a> retelling of a theft all but Nate claim to have committed.

Polk nearly goes through with it, but ultimately he takes medical leave to go into alcoholism rehab instead. Meanwhile, Mahon talks about committing a little follow-up fraud of his own, by continuing to earn income but not reporting it so that it's not deducted from his pension.

Amusingly enough, his insurance provider barely even bats an eye at the idea of him coming back from the dead to collect his insurance. He does at least decide to stop selling him life insurance.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline">EVE Online</a></em>, ship insurance payouts was originally based on a static mineral cost for the ship. However, the player driven economy drove the market value of the ships below the insurance payouts. Players started committing massive in-game insurance fraud by creating a ship, getting insurance, then blowing the ship up as soon as possible for a hefty profit. Eventually, insurance payouts were patched to be tied to the market value of the ship to stop this nonsense.
<ul><li> However, this is still in effect in events such as evictions in Wormhole space, when a destroyed starbase drops more ships than can feasibly be extracted from the system (or drops capital ships which can't fit through the wormholes).
</li><li> It is also somewhat indirectly in effect with the idea of Ship-Replacement Programs ('SRP'; ship insurance paid for by alliance leaders rather than the game) which many large alliances have. In some cases, alliances offer SRP of greater value than the ships being lost, which when combined with the game's default insurance mechanics means that a linemember pilot in a large enough alliance may be able to earn money simply by flying ships into battle and boldly dying for nothing.
</li><li> Worth noting, insurances comes for <em>free</em> with every ship. Players are allowed to buy more valuable plans to increase the resulting insurance payout, but this means that even "uninsured" ships still result in insurance payments on death. The only times in which insurance is not paid out at all are if the ship has no pilot pilot when it dies, or if the ship is destroyed by CONCORD. In a game otherwise taken so seriously that it releases monthly economic reports on its own player-run economy, there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodEconomics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodEconomics">some questions</a> about how the Pend Insurance Company stays in business.

When Mr. Burns finds out what Dimoxinil really is, he yells at Homer, and just when it looks like Homer might get fired and/or sued, Homer's assistant takes the blame.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> episode "Accidents will happen," Squidward complains that a flimsy shelf in the storage room fell and injured him, and he calls the Office of Work Safety <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">(OWS)</a> and files a complaint against Mr. Krabs. As Spongebob, Patrick, and the OWS agent investigates the circumstances of the accident, the agent forces Mr. Krabs to cater to Squidward's every whim, lest Squidward sue Krabs for everything he's got. When Mr. Krabs remembers the surveillance camera he "borrowed" from the airport, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaughtOnTape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaughtOnTape">the video footage reveals that Squidward climbed onto the shelf to take a nap, the shelf collapsed under Squidward's weight, but he was unharmed.</a> As punishment, Squidward has to cater to Mr. Krabs' every whim.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Back around the time of the second Punic War</a>, the Roman government decided to basically insure ships carrying supplies to legions overseas. Two businessmen deliberately sank rotting ships filled with worthless cargoes, then exaggerated their losses. Upon attempting to use violence to escape a trial before the people, capital charges were substituted for the original fine and quite a number of people wound up exiled.
</li><li> In what might be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend">Urban Legend</a>, a man used an unsolicited ad to obtain life insurance on his goldfish. He was absolutely truthful on the application (e.g. weight: 1/2 ounce). The policy was issued and when the goldfish died he submitted a claim. When it went to court, the judge ruled in his favor saying that the insurance company could have read the application and figured out it wasn't a person, but they issued the policy, so they have to pay.
</li><li> Belle Gunness, a serial killer who started out by burning down houses and killing people with life insurance policies - such as her husband and children. She was not very subtle, for example killing her first husband on the one day his two life insurance policies overlapped, but escaped legal attention despite the accusations of the man's relatives. Later she simply attracted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackWidow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackWidow">suitors with money and murdered them.</a>
<ul><li> There is also at least one woman who poisoned a number of friends and relatives for insurance money (on policies they didn't know she'd taken out on them). She got caught when she reacted much more emotionally to a death she HADN'T caused and police finally became suspicious. Cases like this are the reason why you can't take out life insurance on an adult without documentation that they know about.
</li></ul></li><li> Then there's the infamous case of the town of Vernon in - where else? - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInFlorida" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInFlorida">Florida</a>, where there was a sudden and inexplicable surge in insurance claims arising from the loss of a limb, often by people who had taken out ridiculously large insurance policies whose premiums exceeded their income by some margin mere days earlier. The insurance companies figured out what was really going on quite quickly, but every attempt at bringing charges of insurance fraud failed because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">juries refused to believe anyone would actually hack off their own limbs for money.</a> And who can blame them?
</li><li> Mary Anne Cotton: <a class="urllink" href="http://murderpedia.org/female.C/c/cotton-mary-ann.htm">http://murderpedia.org/female.C/c/cotton-mary-ann.htm<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Two business owners decided to have their shop burned down to collect the insurance. All they got was <a class="urllink" href="http://darwinawards.com/darwin/darwin2006-07.html">a double Darwin Award<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The Murder Trust, a gang of five men operating out of New York City in the 1930s. The Trust took out an insurance policy in 1932 on a woman named Betty Carlsen. When she froze to death (after having been fed a lot of drinks, stripped in her room, doused with cool water and left exposed to the elements the Trust cashed in its $800 life insurance policy on her. In 1933 they tried again, insuring one Michael Malloy for $1,400. Every night for a week they poured whisky down his throat certain he'd drink himself to death. He survived. They started serving him anti-freeze. He survived. They started feeding him sandwiches made of rotten sardines washed down with wood alcohol. They started grinding glass and metal into his food including the sardine cans. Nothing could finish him off. Then he disappeared for three weeks. The gang decided to run over a bum, identify him as Malloy and cash in. This victim also stubbornly refused to die. Malloy turned back up following a stay at a hospital that had neglected to register him as a patient. Their patience at an end, the gang got Malloy drunk one last time, took him home, attached a hose to his gas pipe and filled him full of gas. Initially ruled a suicide, police became suspicious and exhumed the body, resulting in murder charges for all involved.
</li><li> In a ripoff of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GuyRitchie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GuyRitchie">Guy Ritchie</a>'s crime caper <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Snatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Snatch">Snatch.</a></em>, a New York City jewel merchant hired thugs disguised <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlterKocker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlterKocker">as Hasidic Jews</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingAndEntering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingAndEntering">to do a phony heist</a> so he can claim a $7 million policy to rescue his ailing business, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">the whole thing came down</a> when new surveillance footage revealed he and an employee emptying the jewels prior to the fake heist and them trying to destroy any evidence of their involvement.

</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Darwin_disappearance_case">John Darwin<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> gained notoriety for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead">faking his own drowning</a>. This was so he and his wife could collect the insurance claim and pay off their mortgage. He secretly lived with his wife Anne for five years while everybody in town, including his children, assumed he was dead. When the ruse was revealed, his children cut off contact with him and his wife and he ended up being convicted of fraud. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/Swindled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/Swindled">Swindled</a></em> has <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AqmjjmbWdM">an in-depth analysis<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of Darwin's disappearance and its aftermath.
</li><li> A more depressing example of this combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInFlorida" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInFlorida">Only in Florida</a> is the so-called <a class="urllink" href="https://www.fixthefloridashuffle.com/florida-shuffle">"Florida shuffle"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, in which drug addicts with health insurance are sent to Florida for rehab — and find themselves caught up in the state's tangle of poorly regulated rehab centers and sober living houses, which leech off of their insurance to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstAid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstAid">doing next to nothing to actually treat their addiction</a>. While it does happen in other states like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/California" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/California">California</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Arizona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Arizona">Arizona</a>, the scam is most commonly associated with Florida, with three-quarters of all the people in Florida's drug treatment centers coming from out of state. That's one macabre justification for Florida's reputation: con artists are flooding the state with people suffering from drug addiction and mental problems as part of an insurance scam.
