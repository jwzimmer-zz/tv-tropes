<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman">Batman</a> might be the poster boy for this trope. He meticulously plans out everything and is unable to deal if any little thing goes not according to plan. In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueOfAmericaTowerOfBabel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueOfAmericaTowerOfBabel">Tower of Babel</a></em> storyline, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RasAlGhul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RasAlGhul">Ra's Al-Ghul</a> was able to use his plans to take down the Justice League (you know, his friends). He unconditionally trusts probably three people: Alfred, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing">Dick Grayson</a>, and Leslie Thompkins. He also micromanages his kids' every move, inside and outside the context of being superheroes. This is somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> as research shows that people who had some sort of childhood trauma grow up to be controlling adults. When something bad happens to you when you're a kid, there's nothing you can do because you're just a kid, however, once you're an adult you can control things better to not have it happen again.
</li><li> Leetah in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest">ElfQuest</a></em> considers herself one of these: she wants to have complete control over her healing powers, going so far as to <em>stab herself in the stomach</em> to force her powers to surge. Granted, she was reacting to severe emotional trauma at the time, but she's admitted that the attitude extends to her daily life and her family. Often, her first reaction to panic is to take charge, heal <em>everything</em> in sight, fix what can be immediately fixed (even if it's a terrible idea to do so) and have a proper emotional breakdown later.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid">Darkseid</a> is a highly extreme example. He wishes to impose not just his rule, but his will, upon every single sentient being in the universe. He considers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilsOfFreeWill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilsOfFreeWill">free will a threat to him</a>, so he seeks the Anti-Life Equation to eliminate free will and impose only his own will upon the universe. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He actually gets to use the Anti-Life Equation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis">Final Crisis</a></em>, and he was taking over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Multiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Multiverse">Multiverse</a> doing so.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Brainiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Brainiac">Brainiac</a> is another extreme example. He travels world to world, stealing technology and culture and then destroying the worlds, keeping one city bottled up for him to remember it by. He hates any situation in which he is not in control, despises developments that are not supervised by him, and would sooner see the universe remain in stasis or be reduced to nothingness than let it change.

However, he doesn't meddle with everything (he prefers to guide things and people so that they'll follow his preferred course anyway), and it is justified by the fact that he's got the road-map to defeating Thanos in his head. This is part of why the Avengers continue to tolerate him after all the shenanigans he pulls - though it's also why he has a very strained relationship with Wanda Maximoff, his former Apprentice and foster-daughter, and Thor has to restrain the occasional homicidal impulse around him.

In one part of the Cobra Island Arc, she is noticeably frustrated and fidgety during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame">maze level</a>. She expected Maka and everyone else to struggle hopelessly as they encounter death trap after death trap while being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">on the clock</a>. What instead happens is they put their heads together and rally through the maze with ease. When the game inevitably goes awry, Medusa is <em>ecstatic</em> that she is back in control. Furthermore, there is the haughty and superior attitude she displays toward Shaula. Finally, Cronas <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithout">shadow</a>, who is pretty much Medusas mouthpiece, tells Crona how he/she is nothing without her. All in all, Medusa cant stand not being in control of people she deems lesser.
</li><li> Harry is an interesting variation of this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ThePowerOfSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ThePowerOfSeven">The Power of Seven</a></em>, where circumstances have led to him forming a 'harem' of seven witches. While Harry isn't a 'control freak' in the sense that he 'needs' to control everything, characters note that he has lived his entire life with other people making decisions for him and causing him various degrees of pain. As a result, his relationships with Katie Bell and Demelza Robbins in particular help him cope with his lack of control; Katie is a more experienced lover who is able to 'domme' Harry in a subtle, nurturing manner that encourages him to accept her authority without forcing him to obey her, while Demelza's absolute surrender of control to him helps Harry feel like he can cope with the burdens placed on him.
</li><li> As in <em>Power of Seven</em>, control in a sexual environment is a key aspect of the relationship in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> fanfic series "<a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150124011035/http://papa-bear.com/fanfic/WuffaraChronicles.html">Wuffara Chronicles<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>", as Buffy is dominated by Tara while Willow is Buffy's sub; Buffy reflects that she is tired of having to be in charge all the time, which allows her to revel in the opportunities to submit to Tara, while controlling Willow helps her feel as though she has taken charge of something in her life (Willow and Tara's roles in the dynamic are fundamentally more straightforward, with Tara appreciating a sense of power after so long being abused by her family while Willow has always been driven to excel to gain attention).

When this continues after she's already given up on him and started dating Luka, Marinette puts her foot down and outright <em>refuses</em>... only for Alya to stage an 'emergency meeting', inviting all the other girls to the bakery and attempting to force her into <em>another</em> scheme. Followed by attempting to override Marinette's attempts to send the others away so they can talk privately, with Marinette having to point out that they're currently in <em>her</em> room, in <em>her</em> house, which <em>she</em> invited herself and the rest of them to without permission.
</li><li> Alya also sees nothing wrong with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing">heavily editing footage</a> she secretly took of one of Chat Noir's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfession">Love Confessions</a> to make it seem as though Ladybug returned his feelings, then posting it on her Ladyblog as an '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabloidMelodrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabloidMelodrama">exclusive scoop</a>'. When Ladybug confronts her about this, she's completely dismissive of her feelings, even suggesting that <em>Ladybug</em> is somehow being unreasonable for wanting control over her own image or who she dates.
</li><li> Side story <em>The Hour Glass is Drifting Away</em> touches on Nino's discomfort with her efforts, revealing that she forced her way into the trip to the wax museum when he originally just wanted to have some 'bro time' with his pal. He was also uncomfortable with her plans to post that footage on her blog, but didn't speak up... and when Ladybug gently confronts him on this, recognizes that he made a mistake and accepts being benched for the summer with grace.

Granted, Bob isn't a great employee for an insurance firm (given his conscience won't let him deny any claims), but Huph's pure bullying nature and reactions of offended dignity point to Bob not quite being the problem here. He even gives Bob a pre-planned disciplinary speech much like the "monologues" given by the super-villains Bob used to fight as Mr. Incredible. While cartoonish, his comeuppance is way too satisfying to watch.

Watson, the maintenance man, who HATES Ullman admits that Ullman is good at what he does and definitely earns his salary. Ullman is the first manager of the Overlook who's ever turned a profit for the place.

And as she's one of the landed gentry, people are very reluctant to disagree with her. This leads to a certain amount of tension when she eventually meets Elizabeth Bennet, who is not the sort of person to let other people push her around and bully her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Especially when one of the things that Lady Catherine believes is the "wrong" way of doing things is Elizabeth getting married to Mr. Darcy...</span>

She intends on using the torturing spell, the Cruciatus Curse, on Harry to get information on Sirius' location, but Hermione says that it's illegal to use it on another human being (It is.) Umbridge decides to use it anyway since "what Fudge (the Minister of Magic) doesn't know won't hurt him!"
<ul><li> Vernon and Petunia Dursley are more comedic examples of this. They're quite proud of the totally mundane middle-class life they live and go to great lengths to keep it up. While they and their son have little trouble with this, this trope comes into play in regards to the strange things that happen because Harry's a wizard. Even seemingly harmless things, like Ron thinking he had to yell through a phone or Mrs. Weasley covering an envelope in stamps because she wasn't sure how many were meant to go on for Muggle post, get the Dursleys angry simply because they hate any magical-related things interfering with their lives.

</li><li> Alice Cullen of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> often comes across as this. She dictates what clothes her family wears and apparently rarely allows them to wear the same things twice. Throughout the series, she also forces Bella to act as a living Barbie, making her put on make-up and dresses Alice approves of and forcing her to go to dances Bella has no interest in attending. When she finds out that Bella simply wants a shotgun wedding without any fancy ceremonies, she promptly guilt-trips Bella into letting her arrange a massive wedding, even though the Cullens periodically re-marry for public appearances and thus there's no shortage of weddings to plan. In one of the outtakes, Alice is so determined to make Bella wear an outfit she approves of that she forces Bella to wear stiletto heels while Bella's in a foot cast and on crutches, has her broken foot be given a pedicure, and gives serious thought to removing the cast early just so Bella can wear matching shoes.
</li><li> Curran from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KateDaniels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KateDaniels">Kate Daniels</a></em> fits this in the extreme. He cares about his people, but it turns out that due to childhood trauma his main motivator is that he is hellbent on keeping his future family safe. Forcing the various shapeshifter Clans to make peace and work together, shaping them into the Pack single-handedly? All so his future mate would never be caught in the crossfire between Clans. Building the Keep, which is a huge sprawling castle designed to be easily defended, and can protect about 1500 shapeshifters? All so his mate and children would have a safe place to live. Unfortunately, he didn't count on falling for Kate, who rebels against all authority by nature. Naturally, this causes tension.

<ul><li> Lana also could be described this way, in terms of how she treats Clark. She wants Clark to divulge all his secrets to her, whether he likes it or not, and be completely under her thumb. Whenever any of the characters doesn't initially go along with what she wants them to do, Lana typically chews them out and then stomps out of the room; by the end of most episodes, the other characters have usually capitulated and apologized to her.

Lex, like Lana, wants to know Clark's secret and is willing to go to life-threatening lengths to obtain it: sending superpowered murderers to hold Clark's family hostage in an attempt to force him to reveal any superpowers he may have (this ends up being what breaks his and Clarks' friendship). He's willing to let his dad stick around, but only as long as he's subordinate to Lex. He also misses his deceased brother and clones him so that he can have him back... but gets insanely angry when the clone no longer wants to follow the script that Lex wants him to live by. Terrifyingly, it is implied that Lex <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> has the clone killed, viewing him as a failed experiment.</span> And, of course, there's the horrifying twist of late Season 6 where we learn that Lex <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> chemically-manipulated Lana's body with hormones to simulate a pregnancy, in order to help push her into marrying him, and then letting her believe that she had miscarried afterwards</span>, causing her to fall into a deep depression.

</li><li> Lex's beliefs that influence his behavior this way are possibly best summed up at the end of Season 5's Christmas episode "Lexmas", where — after considering it all episode — he decides to use dirty tricks to try and win the election he's in, saying "What I want more than anything is to live <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter">Happily Ever After</a>. And do you know what the secret to living happily ever after is? *pause* <em>Power.</em> Money and power. See, once you have those two things, you can secure everything else.

Marie has been pulling this on the whole family for decades, using guilt to get everyone to go along with her wishes. Debra is also this trope, wanting Ray to be completely under her control, telling him when he's "allowed" to relax or spend time with his friends, beating him and emotionally tormenting him when she doesn't get her way. Arguably, a large amount of the conflict between Marie and Debra could be chalked up to the fact that they're both control freaks with competing agendas: each wants complete, uncontested control of Ray for herself, and since they can't both have this, they end up fighting, while poor Ray ends up living a miserable existence between the two of them.

But whenever it starts to look like his position as leader of the group or his command over things is slipping, he gets very uptight and very tense very, very quickly. He later admits that he's one of these, and it's only because he usually is in control that he's able to act so relaxed about things.

Timo is an extremely skilled thief specializing in banks, armored cars and other places with a vault, and he's so secretive with his plans that Michael finds it impossible to disrupt them ahead of time, and winds up with Timo holding a gun to his face more than once during the episode for asking basic questions. According to Sam, the approach has worked since Timo's suspected of being behind numerous high-end and unsolved heists yet he's only been arrested once (and the only witness to said crime was "mysteriously" murdered). On the other hand, when Michael makes the job go bad, all he has to do to make the gang turn on Timo is cause Timo to be late to the gang's rendezvous (thanks to a simple flat tire) and plant an explosive nearby. The explosive could come from anywhere, but the idea that Timo's meticulous plans would somehow go wrong <em>and</em> that Timo would be late is so unfathomable that the entire crew jumps to the conclusion that Timo must have decided to kill them to keep all the money for himself.
</li><li> Detective Rosa Diaz in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrooklynNineNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrooklynNineNine">Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a></em>. It's subtle, and she keeps it well hidden underneath a tough, intimidating and no-nonsense exterior, but a closer examination reveals that practically everything about her is designed to rigidly maintain control over every aspect of her life and relationships with others. This includes her job (being a police officer puts her in authority over others), her personality (her intimidating stoicism enables her to control people through fear of her), her personal life (she refuses to divulge any information about herself, no matter how harmless, so that no one has anything they can use against her), her relationships (she only dates certain types of men to ensure that she's always the one to end the relationship) and so on. As with Jeff Winger above, the reason she's able to maintain an unflappable exterior is that she's usually in control; whenever something does go wrong, she tends to melt down quick (she's almost reduced to tears when kids make fun of her instead of being intimidated by her, technology failing on her sends her into a violent tantrum, etc.).
</li><li> Joy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfAnubis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfAnubis">House of Anubis</a></em> developed this trait in the second season. Whenever she was given some sort of authority, be it being in charge of setting up the school dance, being the main editor of the school blog, or being in charge of the Senet game, she had a tendency to get very pushy and stubborn, keeping everyone working and making sure they were doing things her way.

<ul><li> Styx broke up over it in 1983 following the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KilroyWasHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KilroyWasHere">Kilroy Was Here</a></em> debacle. The classic lineup finally reconciled and reunited in 1995, but Dennis's Control Freak tendencies started rearing their head again by 1999. This time, rather than breaking up the whole band, the others just kicked him out.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Roger Waters</a>. If <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidGilmour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidGilmour">David Gilmour</a> is to be believed, his control-freak mode kicked in around 1977's <em>Animals</em>. It got worse with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall">The Wall</a></em>, which was almost entirely his writing, and culminated in <em>The Final Cut</em>, which infamously had the words <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">"Written by Roger Waters; performed by Pink Floyd"</a> printed on the back cover. Then he left the band and a series of lawsuits ensued involving who had the right to use the <em>Animals</em> pig and whether the rest of the band had the right to use the name "Pink Floyd."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a>, during the final years of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>. Semi-justified though, in that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a> was preoccupied with his side projects/relationship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YokoOno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YokoOno">Yoko Ono</a> and generally pissing off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison">George Harrison</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr">Ringo Starr</a>, to such a degree that McCartney had to literally take over the recording sessions with an iron hand just to keep things going.
<ul><li> Even after the Beatles broke up. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> version of <em>Twist and Shout</em> became a hit again after being in the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FerrisBuellersDayOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FerrisBuellersDayOff">Ferris Bueller's Day Off</a></em> McCartney was upset because a marching band in the movie was playing horns on it. Never mind the original Isley Brothers version actually did have horns on it!

</li></ul></li><li> Every so often, McCartney will vocally gripe about the familiar "Lennon/McCartney" credit for Beatles songs, and how it unfairly implies that Lennon was the main creative force of the group. While this isn't an entirely unreasonable point of contention on McCartney's part, he has also tried on several occasions to convince or force the rest of the world to start using "McCartney/Lennon" instead, at least regarding songs he was primarily responsible for writing. Given how culturally embedded "Lennon/McCartney" is by this point, this quest is quixotic at best, and he appears more or less resigned to defeat in this case.
</li></ul></li><li> Noel Gallagher joined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Oasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Oasis">Oasis</a> on the condition of taking creative control of the group and becoming its sole songwriter. The rest of the band didn't object, though, since their own songwriting skills were limited. Noel eventually let the others write songs for the band as well.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreedenceClearwaterRevival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreedenceClearwaterRevival">John Fogerty</a>, by most accounts. Tom Fogerty once said he felt he was "hip-checked" out of his role as lead singer when John joined the band.

(Actually, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">he was Felt</a>.) Among other things, he once fired a drummer for having curly hair.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeepPurple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeepPurple">Ritchie Blackmore</a>. It was bad enough while he was in Deep Purple, but singer Ian Gillan and organist Jon Lord had enough clout to hold their own. There was no one to keep him in line in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rainbow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rainbow">Rainbow</a>, however, and it showed.
</li><li> Good lord, Jered Threatin. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/style/threatin-fake-band-tour.html">During his band's ill-fated European tour<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, he scolded his tour bandmates <em>for getting breakfast at the hotel's buffet</em> without his permission, and told them that they needed to say with him at all times. Since Threatin's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeetotaler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeetotaler">teetotaler who doesn't do nightlife</a>, this severely restricted where his bandmates could go during their European tour.
</li><li> A managerial example was Colonel Tom Parker. He generally let <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a> call most of the shots musically, but Parker locked him into a series of bad music and film contracts that prioritized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">Money, Dear Boy</a> over quality, strictly forced Elvis to fulfill them, and came down hard on anyone who questioned him about it. Valuable contributors to Elvis' music career like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeiberAndStoller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeiberAndStoller">Leiber and Stoller</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FromElvisInMemphis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FromElvisInMemphis">From Elvis in Memphis</a></em> producer Chips Moman got blackballed for daring to go against Parker's wishes. Parker even meddled in Elvis' personal life if he thought it was affecting their financial bottom line (though he was conspicuously silent about the drug abuse that ultimate killed Elvis).

His attitude is illustrated in his response when the player character asks him why he keeps fish as pets - one of the reasons he gives is that he has total control over their environment, and can thus protect them. He takes a similar though less immediately obvious attitude toward the protagonist and the crew under his command, and the constant attitude of confidence and control he puts forth inspires a great deal of faith and loyalty from them.

He has no interest in their personal desires, only in what they can do to further the business interests of the Schnee Dust Company. When his daughter, Weiss, disobeys him one too many times, he detains her until they reach an "agreement" about how her future will unfold. When Weiss realizes that Whitley has been waiting for Jacques to disinherit both daughters so that he will inherit everything, he reasons that the only way to handle Jacques is to follow the latter's expectations.
</li><li> As a result of his paranoia, General Ironwood believes the first step to any problem is to put <em>him</em> in charge of it; When he comes to Vale in Volume 2, he and Ozpin clash over the appropriateness of the massive fleet he brought along "just in case". Ironwood persuades the council to remove Ozpin and be put in charge of the Vytal Festival's security. After Volume 3, Ironwood begins amassing more and more control over Atlas through his two seats on the council and locks the kingdom up to keep the villains out. By Volume 7, he has turned the city of Mantle into a police state, disturbing the main heroes, and as the situation deteriorates, banes public assembly and considers invoking martial law to get things done without having to negotiate with anyone. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Once he learns that Cinder, who orchestrated his defeat in Vale is in Atlas and Salem is coming personally, he snaps, and arrests the heroes when they refuse to follow his extreme methods.</span>

She berates her husband for taking too long to pick up the newspaper in an abandoned gas station and doesn't let her husband's parents or daughter leave the car during the stop despite at least one of them needing to use the bathroom. Later, when her husband's parents and daughter start rioting against basic demands not being met, she dangerously swerves the car to calm everyone down.

<ul><li> Princess Bubblegum is a low-key example. Granted her kingdom is full of people who can barely take care of themselves. But she can be rather short-sighted in a few decisions and often go to questionable methods that border on this trope.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em>, Stan Smith is such a Control Freak that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">the Almighty Himself</a> called him out on it:
<div class="indent"> <strong>God:</strong> Stop trying to control everything!
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Stan:</strong> I don't do that!
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>God:</strong> Stan, you're holding a gun to God's head. I mean, I can't even think of a metaphor that's better than this, and I'm a published poet.
</div><ul><li> Though this can also be considered an aversion as Stan actually has very little control over his life. He doesnt want Haley to date Jeff, he moves in. He doesn't want another baby, Francine tries to rape him. And while Hayleys actions are usually given the excuse of his harsh rules, theyre usually things like don't come in past curfew, dont drink while underage, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastOfTheseIsNotLikeTheOthers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastOfTheseIsNotLikeTheOthers">dont steal monkeys and keep them in the house</a>. It's reached the point where the family does the complete opposite of what he says the moment he says it.
<ul><li> This is perfectly exemplified in Wiener of Our Discontent where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop">the Aesop</a> was that Stan doesn't have the right to deny Roger control over all human life just because he felt he didn't have any control over his.
</li><li> A later episode implies that his control freakiness is a direct result of his lack of control, as a close brush with death resulted in him going on a miniatures craze that causes him to use a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkRay">Shrink Ray</a> to shrink down and live in the mini town he built.

While she has a rather shrill attitude and frequently manipulates or bullies Baloo and the others into following her schemes, she fails to have much intimidation over them or take much action against their own incompetent or obnoxious habits, leading her to come off more as a bossy friend than a domineering boss.

Despite his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild">Psychopathic Manchild</a> personality and propensity for ridiculous schemes, one should remember that he is still a totalitarian dictator who runs every nook and cranny of his domain with complete disregard for its imprisoned inhabitants. Anyone who disobeys his orders or even question his ideas (I'm looking at you Jared) is either completely ignored, bullied until they comply, or even outright killed if they hinder his "controlled chaos".
<ul><li> Also happens when he replaces his faithful robot, Jailbot, with a more advanced model named Jailbot 2.0. Said robot was completely dedicated to organizing the prison as much as possible, sterilizing its rowdy and chaotic environment and even disobeying its own creator for the sake of cold-hard efficiency.

Princess Celestia had sent her to Ponyville in the hopes of easing her off of this as well as learning the meaning of friendship. Though it was mostly successful, the other ponies still sometimes have to deal with Twilight's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperOCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperOCD">Super OCD</a> tendencies and occasionally pious attitude.

Put bluntly, Blood has mind-control powers, and doesn't like it when his targets break free or resist. This is what leads to his obsession with Cyborg, as noted by the creators on the DVD commentary; Brother Blood has finally met someone who can't be controlled, and it gets under his skin so much that Blood goes to extremes to find out what's causing that.

As explored when his musician, Dwanye, asked that he help make a rock opera based on Franz Kafka. You'd think he be honored by this.
