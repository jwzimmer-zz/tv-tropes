Hence, this is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope">Sub-Trope</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Combat Pragmatist</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>This trope is different than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">Pyrrhic Victory</a>. The gambit revolves around ensuring that stamina/endurance  either over an extremely long period of time or after great expenditure of energy  is the deciding factor in the battle.
</p><p>This trope takes several different forms:
</p><p></p><ul><li> The target is in the midst of a harmful state, inhospitable climate or exhaustive activity. Thus, all the plotter need do is wait for them to run out of gas, collapse, or die altogether. It's possible to speed this up through poison, arbitrary attacks, or sending <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">disposable fodder</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivideAndConquer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivideAndConquer">mutual enemies</a> to help them burn out quicker. The plotter can bring this about deliberately with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExploitedImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExploitedImmunity">Exploited Immunity</a>.
</li><li> Dragging the fight out long enough that the target gets desperate and reveals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded">their ace in the hole</a>, so that the plotter can deal with it on his own terms (note the corollary below).
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> Rather than waiting for the opponent to grow weaker, the plotter has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition">Instant-Win Condition</a> which will take time (such as waiting for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> to show up or for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat">Kill Sat</a> to go online). However, they can't put up anything more than a superficial fight until it happens. Thus, they rely moreso on their <em>own</em> endurance or defense to prevent, avoid, or withstand as much damage as possible before their victory is assured.
</li><li> The longest term variant is simply to avoid the opponent altogether and wait for them to grow too old and weak to be a threat anymore. A move that's really only practical if the practitioner has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality">Complete Immortality</a> or is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless">The Ageless</a>, as we're often talking about waiting decades for the foe to reach such a state.
</li></ul><p>Some of these can overlap. For example, it's possible to poison an enemy, forcing them to overclock their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>, and then have a win condition at the ready <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">just in case</a>. Characters that do this are likely to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>None of these tactics are seen as the most heroic way to fight, as it's considered more virtuous to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsFightLikeGentlemen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsFightLikeGentlemen">fight like a gentleman</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainsEvilBrawnGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainsEvilBrawnGood">pit raw talent, skill, and power against an enemy than use cunning to avoid it</a>. Thus you'll see this most often used by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Villains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Villains">Villains</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti Heroes</a>. This trope is all about making sure that fight is <em>never</em> fair. Rare is such a victory that <strong>doesn't</strong> end with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curb-stomping</a>.
</p><p>Often seen in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookHorrorShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookHorrorShow">Mook Horror Show</a> situation. Expect either a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Weak, but Skilled</a> character to use this tactic. When you're playing a video game and you're required to do this, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine">Hold the Line</a>. However, it's <em>not</em> a good idea to try this on an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncreasinglyLethalEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncreasinglyLethalEnemy">Increasingly Lethal Enemy</a>, as by the time the enemy gets worn out, or reveals their ace in the hole on your gambit, whatever measures they have in place will likely take effect to render it worthless and thus overwhelm you.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Nnoitra uses this against Ichigo. After Ichigo defeats Grimmjow and apparently rescued Orihime, Nnoitra announces his presence by one-shotting the exhausted Grimmjow before thrashing the equally exhausted Ichigo. He viewed Grimmjow, Ichigo and Orihime as equally fair game, but waited for them to work themselves to exhaustion and drop their guard before taking them on.
</li><li> Yhwach tricked Yamamoto into taking on a Yhwach double. After Yamamoto wore himself down killing the double, Yhwach himself stepped in and killed him.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">FemRitters</a> deliberately waited until Kenpachi had exhausted and injured himself from defeating Gremmy Thoumeaux before attacking him, commenting that this was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">smart thing to do</a>. As a result, they beat him up so badly he can't move.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em>: Vicious makes use of this tactic both times he battles Spike. He sends a wave of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> out first, and by the time he's gone through them all Spike has taken at least one gunshot wound.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePrinceOfTennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePrinceOfTennis">The Prince of Tennis</a></em> bout between Karou vs Ryoma. Karou's tennis style is to force his opponent to run from one side of the court to the other, making them too tired to return his volleys. Ryoma turns this around on him by forcing him to keep his knees bent during the whole game, using up twice as much endurance, instead.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> The eponymous character uses this tactic sometimes, given that he has more physical and chakra endurance than almost anyone. However, this trope is often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverted</a> for Naruto, as he often needs that extreme stamina just to <em>keep up</em> with the numerous challenges presented to him.
</li><li> A particularly notable example is when Naruto defeats <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Pain</span>. Ironically, said opponent was using the <em>same tactic at the same time</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because both of them are members of the Uzumaki bloodline, and thus have insane amounts of chakra reserves.</span> Naruto was not only able to avoid becoming exhausted (thanks to replenishment through outside sources) but also able to force <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pain</span> to let his guard down when he finally did exhaust Naruto's last trump card, thus leading straight to his defeat.
</li><li> However, Naruto usually expends that extra energy to do <em>more</em> rather than win his own fight. For example, in the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Fourth Shinobi War</span> Arc, Naruto's new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> is quite powerful and can be used for extended periods of time. Instead of conserving his energy for his upcoming fight, he creates a dozen clones to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> personally turn the tide at every front of the war.</span> This has notable consequences later, but his decision definitely did have its merits.
</li><li> Another example occurs during the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Juubi's Revival sub-arc</span>, where Naruto <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and Kurama, the Kyuubi</span> share chakra with <em>everyone</em>, giving every ally insane amounts of power while still having more than enough for their own use.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>:
<ul><li> Pegasus turns his duel with Yugi into a Shadow Game where both players are steadily drained of stamina to summon their monsters. Yugi eventually faints, forcing the Pharaoh to play alone.
</li><li> Yami Bakura easily defeated Pegasus in a mental <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamOWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamOWar">Beam-O-War</a> by attacking him after he just faced Yugi.
<div class="indent"><strong>Yami Bakura</strong> (<em>in the dub</em>): Really, Pegasus, is that all you can muster? Ah, you've been fatigued by your duel with Yugi. Your mind is weary while mine is fresh!
</div></li><li> Yami Marik turns his duel with Joey into a Shadow Game where both players take any damage their monsters take. Marik plays not to win, but to inflict as much damage as possible to Joey. Eventually, Joey is about to win, but passes out and goes into a coma before he can declare his final attack.
</li><li> In the Orichalcos Arc, Joey had two duels back to back against Valon and Mai, where the Seal of Orichalcos makes the damage real. He beats Valon, but against Mai, he collapses from exhaustion and surrenders.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhTheDarkSideOfDimensions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhTheDarkSideOfDimensions">Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions</a></em>, Yugi had to do <em>three</em> duels back to back, against Aigami, then Kaiba, then Aigami and Kaiba in a triangle duel. In both the duels against Aigami, Aigami makes the duel inflict real damage and the players have to spend their stamina to summon monsters. In the final duel, Yugi eventually reaches his limit and faints right before he can draw his last card. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fortunately, the Pharaoh returns and completes his move for him to defeat Aigami.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>
<ul><li> This is how Elfman defeats Bacchus in the Grand Magic Games. Bacchus' magic martial arts make him too fast for Elfman to dodge, so he simply transforms into a Lizardman with incredibly tough and spiky scales. The entire match from that point on consists of Bacchus landing countless powerful blows on Elfman while seriously damaging his own hands in the process, with announcers noting that it ultimately comes down to whether or not Bacchus' hands and stamina can endure long enough to brute-force past Elfman's defense. In the end, while Elfman comes dangerously close to breaking, Bacchus falls down exhausted first and concedes defeat to his "manly" opponent.
</li><li> Played with at the very end of the final day of the Games. The final confrontation comes down to the five members of Fairy Tail's team facing down Sting, the only remaining member of Saber Tooth's team. While Sting ordinarily wouldn't stand a chance, all five Fairy Tail wizards are exhausted and badly wounded, while Sting is largely unscathed. In the end, however, Sting decides to surrender for personal reasons, and Fairy Tail wins the Grand Magic Games.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StreetFighterIITheAnimatedMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StreetFighterIITheAnimatedMovie">Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie</a></em>: After all the brooding and dramatic build up, Guile finally gets his shot at revenge against Bison near the end of the film. Except Bison makes Guile look like a complete joke, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam">teleporting around him faster than he could keep up with</a>, essentially letting Guile wear himself out trying to hit him. Even Guile's Sonic Boom fails to connect. Bison one-shots him immediately afterwards and decides he isn't worth further attention.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em>: Sanosuke notes this trope in his first fight with Kenshin, stating that it's not the better swordsman who wins, but the one who is left standing (which Kenshin throws back in his face). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This tactic is also used by during the fight with Shishio, which ends with Shishio <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOnFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOnFire">combusting.</a></span>
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> M'Quve proclaims that Zeon can do this with the resources they got from Odessa, however that proved to be nothing more than hot air. Moreover, this is how the <em>Federation</em> wins: Zeon had destroyed the Federation Space Force fleet early but almost exhausted their resources, and the Federation used its superior resource base to replenish those losses over a year of war and attrition while Zeon invaded Earth in the attempt to either conquer the entire planet or, as a fallback option, recover enough resources to win by endurance (what M'Quve was referring to, horribly underestimating how fast the Federation had rebuilt).

<ul><li> Although Goku is already stronger than Frieza after becoming a Super Saiyan, he mostly beats Frieza because his power began to rapidly drop after he uses his full strength. As Goku surmises, Frieza can't control his full power since he never had to fight seriously before, which is why he burns himself out in such a short amount of time.
</li><li> Androids 17 and 18 have an inexhaustible energy source built into them, so unless you're already strong enough to break them, you'll just exhaust yourself pounding away at them until they can win.
<ul><li> Although 18 was already stronger than Vegeta when they fought, she toys with him by making him chase her and then repeatedly swing and miss at her until he is exhausted. Piccolo notices her tactic, but Vegeta is so angry that he doesn't notice until it is too late.
</li><li> 17 specifically brings this up when Piccolo fights him after fusing with Kami, noting that while they're evenly matched, he can keep it up forever while Piccolo will tire out. Piccolo retorts that 17 will make a mistake and lose before that can happen (dub line only). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They turn out to both be wrong, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Cell</a> notices their battle and shows up to absorb 17, and he's far stronger than either of them.</span>
</li><li> 17 and 18 use their infinite energy to their advantage in The Tournament of Power saga in <em>Super</em>, both managing to be some of the longest lasting fighters in a battle royal setting simply by the virtue of never running out of stamina.
</li></ul></li><li> The fights against Buu also had an element of this, particularly Kid Buu, who combines ridiculous regeneration abilities <em>and</em> near-bottomless stamina. Super Saiyan 3 Goku could fight him evenly at first, but quickly started feeling the strain of that form while Buu kept coming back for more.

</li><li> In the Tournament of Power, one condition of victory is to have the most fighters remaining by the end of the tournament.
</li><li> A number of fighters, notably Kakunsa and Viara, in the Tournament of Power state their intent to win this way: Kakunsa is confident in her stamina and uses constant relentless attacks to wear down her opponents, while Viara has incredibly durable armor and lets people waste their strength trying to break it before hitting them when they're exhausted. Unfortunately, both of them wind up fighting Universe 7's Androids 17 and 18, who, as mentioned above, have <em>infinite</em> stamina and never get tired. Android 17 quips to Viara in particular that "just standing there and letting us attack you was a pretty stupid plan".

The TSAB would either arrest an exhausted Fate or she would die. Since Nanoha didn't like the second option, she decided to disobey the TSAB and save Fate (and Fate eventually escaped due to other interference). The irony is that Chrono's mother, who agreed to the strategy, would adopt Fate in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaAs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaAs">next season</a>.

The final "battle" comes down to whether or not they can take him down and release the shadows before they all die, which they do by the skin of their teeth, as in <em>they were already burning away in the sunlight by the time it happened</em>.
</li><li> Doflamingo vs Luffy, after Luffy unleashes Gear Fourth on him. Even though Doflamingo was severely beaten through the nation by Luffy, his stamina ran out within 10 minutes, leaving him weakened. Doflamingo, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a> as he is, recovered first and prepared to kill Luffy, and would have succeeded if Gatz and his other allies didn't manage to severely distract him from laying the killing blow.
</li><li> Luffy's fight with Katakuri during the <em>Whole Cake Island arc</em> winds up coming down to this. The fight ends up lasting <em>10 hours</em> due to to the fact Luffy tries to enhance his Observation Haki during it, meaning he had to practically either dodge or tank Katakuri's hits while occasionally trying to hit back (which is next to impossible due to Katakuri's Haki that allows him to see ahead in time). The two become so worn out, they figure to go all out with their attacks with the last of the strength and end up knocking each other out with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossCounter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossCounter">Cross Counter</a>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder8');">    Professional Wrestling </div><div class="folder" id="folder8" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> This is a strategy (and a good source of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">kayfabe</a> drama) behind several gimmick matches. A few notable types are the Iron Man match (match goes to a set time limit, each pin/submission/count-out/DQ earns one point, most points when time runs out wins), Last Man Standing match (can't stand after a ref's ten-count), and a Steel Cage match (escape the cage first). A common tactic by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel">heel</a> is to just wait until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">face</a> is so tired they can't fight back before making a move.
</li><li> A few wrestlers have attempted such a strategy in WWE's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble">Royal Rumble</a> Match, usually by hiding in a corner or just refusing to get into the ring until everyone else is too tired. Invariably, this never works, as someone else is bound to throw them in the ring or yank them out of the corner to force the issue.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldust">Dustin Rhodes</a>' 1990-1991 run in the WWF, he became involved in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DustyRhodes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DustyRhodes">his father's feud</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TedDiBiase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TedDiBiase">Ted DiBiase</a>, to the point where DiBiase demanded a match against the younger Rhodes, so he could beat him to a pulp. Dustin agreed to the match, but added a stipulation: That DiBiase had to pin in him the ring within 10 minutes, or he'd lose. Sure enough, Dustin won the match — although this was largely DiBiase's fault... repeatedly, through his arrogance, "The Million Dollar Man" broke up his own two-counts on multiple occasions when he could have easily pinned Dustin, but wanted to beat on him some more in an effort to gain a psychological advantage over the elder Rhodes.
</li><li> Several professional wrestling journalists, primarily those who wrote for magazines associated with Bill Apter, criticized the WWF's rule allowing its champions to retain the title via countout or disqualification, noting that a champion must win the match by pinfall or submission to be considered legitimate and to keep his title. The one exception: If he is in a submission hold but had not yet submitted when the time limit expired... fitting this trope to a "T."

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder9');">    Sports </div><div class="folder" id="folder9" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope-a-dope">Rope-a-dope<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" is this strategy as applied to the sport of Boxing. The technique was first used and named by boxer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli">Muhammad Ali</a> for his 1974 fight against George Foreman (the "Rumble in the Jungle" match in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DemocraticRepublicOfTheCongo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DemocraticRepublicOfTheCongo">Kinshasa</a>). Foreman was stronger and closer to his peak than Ali, who was out of practice after an involuntary three-year hiatus in his career. Knowing that he couldn't match Foreman punch for punch, Ali focused on protecting himself and hanging on the ropes, reducing the effectiveness of Foreman's damaging punches, for round after round after round. By the seventh round, Foreman was exhausted because he'd literally been doing nothing but attacking for seven rounds, while Ali, who'd been doing little but defending, was relatively fresh (he <em>was</em> injured - you can't get punched and avoid all consequences, even with a good defense, but he was in much better shape than Foreman). Ali came out in the eighth swinging hard, and Foreman couldn't defend himself, much less fight back. The match was over soon after. Since then, various fighters have used this technique from time to time, particularly against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> opponents who can't see that it's an act.
</li><li> In mixed martial arts endurance is often a deciding factor. Some fighters are so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">fast and strong</a> that the fight seems like a foregone conclusion after the first thirty seconds. However, if the opponent is able to dodge or absorb attacks for a round or so then their muscular opponent will likely be so exhausted that they will leave themselves vulnerable. Still, it is a risky tactic as all fights have time limits and if they go to a decision then the judges (and fans!) are more likely to favor the more aggressive combatant.
</li><li> While its place as a "sport" is up for contention despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">now being referred to as Sports Entertainment</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling">Professional Wrestling</a> is well known for this sort of victory. Aside from the usual bouts of Determinator and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">Nigh-Invulnerable</a> wrestlers, many matches are based on this concept, like: the "Iron Man" hour-long marathon to see who has the most pinfalls/submissions; "Last Man Standing" matches where you have to keep the opponent down for a 10 count; cage matches where you have to get your opponent so worn down they can't stop you from exiting the cage; and any number of other gimmick matches where the expectation is "beat the guy down so much he can't fight back, and you can put him into/out of the victory condition, or he can't prevent you from doing so." Or, at least, they are HYPED as this, until one or the other figures out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">an alternate means of grabbing victory</a>.
</li><li> One of the most famous victories in sports was the 2002 Winter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames">Olympic Games</a> 1000 m short track speed skating event. Australian Steven Bradbury won Australia's first ever Winter Olympics gold medal after every other competitor crashed on the final turn of the final lap. Bradbury, who hopelessly behind at that point, simply glided to victory past the other fallen skaters scrambling to get back on their feet. Since then, "doing a Bradbury" has become Australian slang for "a fortuitous event".
</li><li> This was the (unintentional) strategy that won <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a> LI for the New England Patriots over the Atlanta Falcons after the Falcons had run up a 28-3 lead late in the third quarter. The Patriots held the ball for a little over 40 minutes of game time, and literally ran twice as many offensive plays as the Falcons did. This imbalance was in place even before the comeback started, despite the lopsided score, as the Falcons were either scoring quickly or punting quickly, while the Patriots kept grinding out yards despite almost nothing to show for it, forcing the Falcons defense to keep running all over the field. By the fourth quarter, the Falcons defense was totally gassed, and were steamrollered for the rest of the game.
</li><li> This is largely how Rafael Nadal has won <em>ten</em> French Open championships, while winning "only" six other Major championships combined. The clay courts of the French Open take more speed of the ball when it bounces on them, compared to the grass courts of Wimbledon or the hard courts in the US and Australian opens. This makes it relatively harder to blast a winner by your opponent. Nadal, who is in great shape even compared to other top level pro tennis players, can thus run down balls for hours on end, and his opponents struggle to keep up. With a full five set match potentially pushing <em>five hours</em> in time, Nadal can win by attrition.
</li><li> An extremely common strategy in the grueling, five-day matches of cricket. Remaining on the field for hours on end while also bowling/chasing after the ball is extremely tiring. Many teams have tried to capitalize on this by using defensive, technically-sound batsmen who simply play as long as they can while taking no risks, grinding down the opposition bowlers. Once they are suitably gassed out, the batsman (or his other team-mates) can then take advantage to build up huge scores.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder10');">    Tabletop Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder10" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> As a general example, this is the premise behind a mill deck in collectible card games. Rather than directly defeating the opponent, a mill deck causes the opponent to run out of resources, usually by depleting the opponent's deck, which is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition">Instant Loss Condition</a> for many card games.

</li><li> For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ArsMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ArsMagica">Ars Magica</a></em>, the <em>Houses of Hermes</em> supplement introduced a more visceral alternative to the Certámen ritual combat, preferred by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">House Flambeau</a> - the Test of Flames, aka Inirelte's Certámen. It conjures up a circle of fire, and the winner is whoever can stay inside longest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> has both strategic and gameplay examples:
<ul><li> The Tau use this during conflicts with much larger and more established galactic powers like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">the Imperium of Man</a>, as best seen during the Damocles Gulf Crusade and the Taros campaign. The Tau see little point in desperate battles to hold ground, and will fall back from a strong enemy offensive, offering only what resistance is needed to cover their retreat, before regrouping at rally points. As their enemy advances, the Tau use their superior mobility to harry their foe's flanks, compromising their strategy or forcing them to spread themselves thin. Eventually the Tau's opponents end up under-strength and unable to press their numerical advantage.
<ul><li> In tabletop, this is demonstrated by one of the two Tau strategies, dubbed Kauyon or "Patient Hunter" in fluff. A maneuverable mechanized Tau force or Tau "British Gunline" can force a slow game, prevent itself from being pinned into decisive encounters, cap or contest objectives, and only get into exchanges when they are favorable trades for the Tau while concentrating firepower on critical enemy units. This kind of plan, when successful, results in a (for Warhammer) relatively low-casualty game which the Tau control the pace of while grinding out a win. What makes this unusual is the Tau are relatively squishy; they achieve a Victory by Endurance through maneuver and board control.
</li></ul></li><li> On the tabletop, this is how units devoted to Nurgle work. Unlike other Chaos Gods, Nurgle's daemons or mortal champions can't quickly crush their enemies in close combat or blow them apart with magic, but are instead inhumanly tough. So if a unit of Plague Marines can't achieve a decisive victory in the first round of combat, between their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelNoPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelNoPain">inability to feel pain</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoutStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoutStrength">diseased bulk</a>, the enemy is going to struggle to inflict casualties, while the Plague Marines steadily chip away at them. Worse, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plaguemaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plaguemaster">blessing of Nurgle</a> means that simply being in close combat with the likes of Plaguebearers is eventually lethal, regardless of whether they land any blows.
</li><li> Tarpit units are meant to charge into powerful enemies not to kill them, but to take them out of the fight. Very few Warhammer units have the ability to jump out of close combat, and once in combat you can't do anything else. Hence one of the easiest ways to remove a problematic unit that you have no idea how to deal with is to simply throw cheap cannon fodder at it; the game usually lasts 6 turns and if the unit is big enough it can conceivably tie up the enemy unit for the duration of the game, effectively "wasting" that unit for your opponent. This is specifically a counter for Deathstar Units, as if you managed to tie up a unit that the entire enemy strategy is hinged around, you pretty much have won the game.
</li></ul></li><li> This is the core strategy of the Dromoka brood in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>. Strength, speed, cunning, and ruthlessness are all meaningless if you simply can't be beaten.
</li><li> This is one of the strategies behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Monopoly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Monopoly">Monopoly</a>. The player with the most money wins...but even if one player has $1 and everyone else has <em>nothing,</em> that one dollar is still the most money!

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder11');">    Video Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder11" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In general, this is the reason behind the strategy known as "camping" — getting a slight lead, then waiting out the timer. Generally speaking, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue">a legitimate strategy</a>, it tends to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic">viewed rather negatively</a>, and games that encourage or reward over-reliance on it instead of offensive play tend to be seen as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualCompetitiveConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualCompetitiveConflict">less competitive</a>" and die a quiet death.
</li><li> A variation appears in games where the characters have some sort of self-healing option, or better yet, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegeneratingHealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegeneratingHealth">an automatic health regeneration-over-time ability</a>. This leads to Health Tanking, where the character just keeps taking hits and healing them back up faster than enemies can inflict damage. At some point, the Health Tank can get a few hits in to wear down their opponent, whereas said opponent is forced to spend an excessive amount of energy just trying to make sure that some of the damage dealt actually <em>sticks</em>.
</li><li> In some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame">Role Playing Games</a>, the player can fight against a particularly tough monster or boss by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaDrain">Mana Drain</a>, leaving it too crippled to fight back.
</li><li> Also happens in most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame">Fighting Games</a> (mainly those whose timers count down from 99), when a round is won by Time Over.
</li><li> Pretty much how <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> Battles are played out. Generally, the player will have a full party of six Pokemon, whereas NPC Trainers will almost always have fewer than six. Most notably are the Gym Leaders whom the player can beat by simply outlasting their team, even if their party is under-leveled and or doesn't have any Pokemon with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">type advantage</a> against the Gym Leader. Players will start facing full teams once they get to the endgame sections with the Elite Four in particular. This is different in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnimeOfTheGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnimeOfTheGame">anime</a>, where a set of match rules are agreed upon between trainers before the fight starts, such as both parties agreeing to only use X number of Pokemon. This is seen most often against Gym Leaders and Pokemon tournaments.
<ul><li> Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> with the Stall tactic in the competitive scene. Entry hazards, status conditions like poison, and healing moves like Recover and Wish mean that certain very tanky pokemon can simply outlast whatever the opponent can throw at them. Stall players tend to abuse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">Elemental RockPaperScissors</a> to force the opponent to constantly switch to their counter to whatever the Stall user has out, letting them switch to something else or heal up in the meantime, all while the opponent's health is cut into by the above damage sources.
</li><li> Similarly, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGo">Pokémon GO</a></em>, gyms have a set number of Pokémon, while the player can crash their team against it as long as they like. As you defeat Pokémon and degrade the Motivation of a gym Pokémon, they get weaker. So long as your potion supply isn't an issue and you can reliably beat at least one each time, victory is more or less certain barring outside interferences. On the flip side, gym battles are timed events, and timing out is an automatic loss for the player. With a sufficiently bulky defending Pokémon (Blissey is infamous for this), the defender doesn't need to be able to beat you, only outlast you.
</li></ul></li><li> According to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncyclopediaExposita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncyclopediaExposita">Codex</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>, this is humanity's main method of fighting. Humanity attacks the enemy's supplies and resources foremost, leaving their forces to "wither on the vine" until their fleets can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curb stomp</a> them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG">Super Mario RPG</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Culex</a>, unlike every other boss in the game, has a finite FP pool for spellcasting. If you can tank his attacks for long enough, he effectively takes himself out of the fight. This does not, however, solve the problem of his four elemental crystals which aid him in battle, and which do have limitless FP.
</li><li> All too many strategy games can have a human player sit back and defend themselves while the enemy wastes its resources attacking until they have nothing left, at which point you can run them over with a relatively small attack.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a> V</em>, if an AI civ with a high "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">boldness</a>" rating and far more units than you declares war, and your city is well defended with ranged units, they will dash most of their units against your city, often opening themselves up to counter-attack if you play your own units wisely.

The other is an in-game triathlon that covers a large portion of the game map and involves the player button-mashing for close to <em>20 minutes</em> as the player character swims the length of an inland sea (a task that by itself it takes nearly 10 minutes to complete), then cycles for several miles, and then engages in a foot race. Numerous players have reported that by the end of the mission, you feel like you've run a marathon yourself.

However, they have one weakness: their charismatic leader Eichi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllBoy">suffers from an illness</a> that means he must take care not to exert himself. So Trickstar and its allies attack him in the DD by forcing him to face against the strongest opponents possible before the final, with units like Ryuuseitai willingly sacrificing themselves in the first round so that Eichi cannot take any breaks. Ultimately, Eichi is barely able to cling on through to the finals, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but the votes are too close to call and the units are ordered to go into sudden death. Already barely able to stand, Eichi concedes defeat, granting Trickstar the victory.</span> Interestingly, nobody really comments that taking advantage of an opponent's chronic illness would typically be considered unsportsmanlike, but the ultimate result is pretty universally considered good.

Even in their Guardian Forms, they know that they don't stand a very good chance against him in a direct fight as long as he's in his demonform. But they also know that Not-Tengu's only as powerful as he is because he's been drawing on the massive levels of ambient magic around Moperville, so they simply dodge and evade him until the three of them burn through all the ambient energy in the immediate vicinity. Not-Tengu had burnt through most of his own reserve by this point as well, so he loses his flight spell and demonform.

<ul><li> The "endurance hunt", thought by anthropologists to be the hunting method that put humanity at the top of the food chain. It is a method of hunting by tracking and chasing a single target for as long as it takes for it to get tired. While most animals can easily outpace humanity in short bursts, no other species has our potential for endurance (basically, you follow your prey at a brisk walk until it drops from heat exhaustion). As long as the human is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">persistent enough</a>, eventually the animal will be too tired to run or fight and collapse. Then it's pretty much over. However, human endurance hunting is limited to warm or hot climates—humans' relative stamina relies on ability to sweat with access to water while their hunted prey will overheat, so that method doesn't work in temperate or cold climates.
<ul><li> Even in temperate and cold climates, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One Hit Kills</a> with arrow or spear weren't guaranteed even for skilled hunters, so wounded prey often had to be tracked overland. Bloodloss and panic would wear the prey's endurance down while the hunter followed.
</li></ul></li><li> Another real life example is wolves, which are as adapted to cold weather endurance as humans are to warm. When the two species started working together (with wolves becoming dogs), everything made of meat was basically screwed.
</li><li> Komodo dragons. The Komodo has a very nasty venomous bite that causes, among other things, inhibition of blood clotting, lowered blood pressure, hypothermia (as a result of the previous two), and paralysis. It will chase and bite its prey again and again relentlessly, using its superior stamina compared to other lizards as a weapon, until the prey falls dead from shock.
</li><li> Anglosphere popular culture would consider this "the Russia Gambit", as this is how people in English-speaking countries believe Russia won the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars">The Napoleonic Wars</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, supposedly by Russia constantly retreating into colder and colder territory while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">using their near-limitless numbers</a> to slowly wear the invaders down. The reality is that while weather and climate are significant factors in warfare within Russia, they are only problematic when you fail to respect them. Moreover while it is true that powerful combatants like France and Russia have fielded, destroyed, and lost forces on a vastly larger scale to countries like the USA and Britain, the actual resources of such countries are hardly infinite.
<ul><li> The Napoleonic Wars were actually a subversion in many ways, as the Russian Army in 1812 was heavily outnumbered by the French and their allies, and the Grande Armée sustained the majority of its losses (through exhaustion, dysentery and typhoid fever) in the summer and early autumn, on the way to Moscow. But the war still lasted well over a year after the French re-crossed the Russian border, and in the spring of 1813, despite one major ally (Austria) declaring itself neutral and another (Prussia) joining the Russian side with a much-expanded army, Napoleon succeeded in assembling an army in Germany well superior in numbers to the Russo-Prussian forces. It was only after Austria joined the anti-Napoleonic alliance that Napoleon's forces became numerically inferior.
</li><li> The Eastern Theatre of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> was won by endurance, but this had nothing to do with "weather" or "limitless numbers". Soviet resources were perilously finite, and carefully husbanding what was left after the first Winter Counter-Offensive was the key to victory.
</li></ul></li><li> The Vietnam War also counts, with North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh famously declaring "if the Americans want to make war for twenty years then we shall make war for twenty years. If they want to make peace, we shall make peace and invite them to afternoon tea." In the end, the Americans underestimated the North's will to fight for years against a technologically superior foe while also taking horrendous losses. In other words, the U.S. military could go home after the war whether they won or lost, while the North Vietnamese's only option was to win the fight because they had nowhere else to go.
<ul><li> In fact, this is one of the two most often employed strategies by the Vietnamese (the other being guerrilla warfare). The longest war in their history lasted for 1000 years (<em>Nghìn năm Bắc Thuộc</em> or 1000 Years of Northern Oppression). Entirely justified since their opponents almost always have superior resources.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecondSinoJapaneseWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecondSinoJapaneseWar">China.</a> Jiang Jieshi gambled on the Japanese suing for peace rather than prosecuting a protracted war, which he believed that his Chinese government could well withstand - if not quite <em>win</em>, as such - and figured that when faced with the prospect of a full-out war the Imperials would accept a face-saving settlement <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1f27s');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1f27s" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1f27s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">protracted warfare is <em>expensive</em>, and both sides had much better things to be doing with their time. Like stamping out socialism.</span> Unfortunately, the Japanese expected that the prospect of protracted warfare would cause <em>Jiang</em> to fold and come to the negotiating table first, also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">failing to understand that the ''Nationalist'' Party couldn't be seen to cave in to Foreign Imperialism in an unequal settlement of the kind that the Japanese wanted from the conflict, because doing so would be tantamount to political suicide.</a> So both sides escalated the war. They were still dogging it out when the USA used Japan's occupation of Indochina as a pretext for embargoing Japan in an attempt to get them to negotiate an end to the war. Because the ruling clique back home couldn't be seen to back down to 'American Imperialism', Japan entered the wider war with an all-out naval-based invasion and occupation of south-east Asia. Allocated secondary importance in the Pacific War — the USA decided that it would use its own forces to 'island hop' its way over to Japan, instead of deploying US forces in China and/or equipping Jiang's forces such that they could go on the offensive themselves, both of which would require ridiclously complex supply lines — the Guomindang was basically made to sit out the rest of the war and given just enough lend-lease material not to become a liability to the Allied cause. In the end, the Guomindang survived the war -0 but once the supply of American money was cut off at the war's end, their regime imploded. They'd been on the edge of doing so in 1942, and American money had staved it off for a while, but they hadn't been given enough to actually <em>fix</em> their problems - just enough to put them off for another day. In 1946, that day came <em>hard</em>.
<ul><li> In fact this was quite basically the entire Allies' <em>modus operandi</em> for the entire war: with 60% of the world's industry and 80% of its manpower, the Allies never <em>really</em> had to worry about losing once it became clear that the Soviet Union wasn't going to sue for peace in 1941-42 - not that Hitler would've accepted their proposals, of course. Nor could even Stalin have survived consigning 40 million of his people to death and another 120 million to slavery by a <em>foreign</em> dictator - if the Soviet leadership hadn't lynched him for trying it, the proletariat would've done it themselves.
</li><li> The RAF, US Army Air Force, and US Navy Air Force firebombing and anti-barge campaign against Germany, Occupied Europe, and Japan eventually began to have a noticeable effect upon Axis military production by early 1945. Until then, it had cost the lives of fifty thousand airmen and hundreds of thousands of civilians to get to that point, and still wasn't anywhere near worthwhile from a pure cost/benefit perspective.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KatanasOfTheRisingSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KatanasOfTheRisingSun">Japan's initial strategy</a> in WWII was a fast war, defeating the US Navy in a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantai_Kessen">decisive sea battle<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and suing for an advantageous peace before the American industrial capacities put that goal out of reach<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2zare');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2zare" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2zare');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the loss of four fleet carriers at Midway six months after Pearl Harbor was the beginning of their downward spiral, and things became <em>much</em> worse once the US began churning out warships and planes at a rate that the Japanese could never afford</span>. Later, when they were losing, that changed to giving the US losses so horrendous that the latter would sue for a peace where they at least could have a somewhat upper hand.
</li></ul></li><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> knife fight between two skilled opponents, if you can't get an easy kill, the idea is to nick the other guy and let him "bleed out". Which doesn't mean he bleeds to death, it means the blood loss tires him out and leaves him vulnerable to a killing stab.
<ul><li> It's also worth noting that this tactic not only <em>can</em> easily be applied to combat of just about any form, but often is the deciding factor. The more a fighter exerts themselves during an offensive, the quicker they will tire. Violence is one of the most physically draining activities that human beings can engage in, and if a victory isn't achieved within the first minute, it's extremely likely that the fight will end in favour of whoever has greater endurance.
</li></ul></li><li> In one Grand Prix race in the 1930s, William Grover Williams, racing for French automaker Bugatti, was up against a German team whose cars were more powerful. Williams realized that he couldn't catch the German leader in a flat-out race, but that the German's more powerful engine would drink fuel faster than the lighter Bugatti, so he eased off and waited for the German to put in for more fuel. During the time it took for the German to refuel, Williams overtook his pole position and secured his spot at the head of the pack, winning the race.
<ul><li> This is still a viable way to win a race, much to the dismay of some NASCAR fans. (Although 'who runs out of fuel first?' drama is something in and of itself when you have multiple teams trying it at once... )
</li></ul></li><li> Roman formations were used to capitalize on this.
<ul><li> That, and the front ranks could be easily allowed to retreat to the rear for a break while fresher troops stepped up (also, the knowledge that if they can survive the first 2 minutes of a battle, they would be rotated out to safety, goes a long way to encourage the front rankers to fight harder).
</li><li> Speaking of the Romans, their victory in the First and Second Punic War fits the description, as they soaked up tremendous losses (in the First Punic War, Rome lost two entire fleets crewed by about 100,000 men each to storms) and crushing defeats (e.g. against Hannibal in the Second Punic War) but kept on fighting for years until they eventually won. Moreover, Rome could replace their losses at a quick pace and had a steady flow of resources, whilst Hannibal had a finite amount of troops and no means of replacing any of his losses.
<ul><li> This is either <em>the</em> or <em>one of</em> the first times this tactic was used as a military doctrine: They later named it the Fabian strategy after the guy who came up with it, Dictator Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus. Despite essentially keeping the Roman military from being destroyed, he still faced massive popularity losses since he refused to directly engage Hannibal while his troops pillaged Italy.
</li><li> The Romans were also willing to work together and gear everything towards the war effort, whilst Hannibal was often undermined by in-fighting at home.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In a number of cases a war of attrition has been the way to prevail against an alliance, in effect by continuing to fight until the differences among the powers fighting you become so great that the alliance fractures, or you even succeed in wooing one of the allied powers away from the others.
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHundredYearsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHundredYearsWar">The Hundred Years War</a>, Henry V of England was allied to the Burgundians, which put him into a seemingly unassailable position to rule France, yet the Dauphin (later Charles VII) fought on and in the end succeeded in coming to an accomodation with Burgundy, which enabled his forces to drive out the now outnumbered English during the reign of Henry VI.
</li><li> France came out of the War of Spanish Succession in much better shape than expected because the war continued until the Habsburg claimant to the Spanish throne died, leaving the German emperor as next in line and thus creating the possibility of one Habsburg ruler of both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire">Holy Roman Empire</a> and Spain. This led to the British concluding a separate peace and the French winning the final battle of Dinant against the Austrians and Dutch.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SevenYearsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SevenYearsWar">Seven Years' War</a> from the Prussian side became a war of attrition after the Prussians began to suffer serious defeats starting in 1757 at Kolin. Frederick the Great continued the fight until some of the powers fighting him dropped out of the alliance (first Russia, then Sweden) and Maria Theresia's other allies lost their determination to reduce Prussia to a marquisat of Brandenburg. But it was a close-run thing, and Frederick would have failed without British subsidies.
</li><li> Similarly, the first French Republic profited from Prussia and Spain leaving the anti-Revolutionary alliance in early 1795 and concluding separate peace treaties in Basel.
</li><li> This was the Austrian strategy in the 1848 campaign of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfItalianIndependence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfItalianIndependence">First War of Italian Independence</a>, against an alliance of all the Italian states except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanMarino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanMarino">San Marino</a> and the Duchy of Lucca (the two smallest ones): while normally Austria could have <em>crushed</em> all the Italian states at once, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RevolutionsOf1848" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RevolutionsOf1848">Revolutions of 1848</a> had deprived them of their forward base in Milan and the naval base in Venice <em>and</em> caused assorted troubles that kept most of their forces outside Italy and even threatened the very existence of Austria, so <em>feldmarshall</em> Joseph Radetzky opted for a fighting retreat toward the Quadrilateral Fortresses (a system of four fortified cities that operated as rearguard bases and fortified line), knowing that while the Kingdom of Sardinia and many volunteers believed in the cause, everyone else was in only for the Revolutions of 1848 and didn't trust the king of Sardinia, Carlo Alberto, at all. As expected, the alliance collapsed when the Pope ordered the retreat of his troops, precipitating the retreat of the other large states, and while the Sardinians and the volunteers were able to breach the Quadrilateral with the conquest of Peschiera, it exhausted their forces, allowing Radetzky (who in the meantime had received some reinforcements) to defeat the Sardinians and launch a counteroffensive.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, this was the ultimate motivation for Hitler launching the Battle of the Bulge; he hoped that he could either inflict such disproportionate losses on the American side that they'd quit on Great Britain, accusing the later of using them for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">Cannon Fodder</a>, or failing that, delay the Western Allies advance long enough for tensions between them and Stalin's USSR (which he saw as a fundamental unnatural alliance) to boil over and allow him to make a separate peace. Unfortunately, everyone involved hated the Nazis so much that they were willing to see the war through to the end, after which the alliance <em>did</em> collapse into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a>.
</li><li> This had also been the Nazi strategy against Britain prior to American entry into the war. Britain was not self-sufficient, and as an island nation, the only way to import the necessary supplies was by sea. Thus, Germany sent out hundreds of U-boats (eventually over a thousand of the submarines) and a handful of surface ships to act as commerce raiders, with the goal of sinking as many British merchant ships as possible. The thinking was that if British merchant ships could be sunk faster than replacements could be built, eventually Britain would run out of ships entirely and be forced to surrender, while Germany (which could bring in fuel and raw materials by land rather than by sea) could outlast them.
</li></ul></li><li> This was Italy's initial strategy in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>: the Italian commander-in-chief Luigi Cadorna knew his troops couldn't match Austria-Hungary in terms of equipment (even if they <em>did</em> ultimately manage to almost bridge the gap, with Italy actually achieving a superiority in artillery), so he gambled on the enemy having to fight on two fronts (with the other being <em>Russia</em>) to achieve local superiority. It ended up failing, but barely: Austria-Hungary ended up breaking through the Italian lines and giving Italy a hell of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> at Caporetto (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingDefeatLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingDefeatLegacy">to this day, over a hundred years after the battle, Italians still use the name "Caporetto" to indicate "crushing defeat"</a>), but the Austro-Hungarians <em>were</em> on the verge of collapsing and in an untenable position (that's why they attacked in the first place), and the only reason they managed to pull it off was a combination of idiocy from Italian officers (who could have spoiled the attack had they been smart enough to act on the intelligence they had), the unexpected Russian collapse allowing the Austro-Hungarians to bring most of their forces to the Italian front, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">Italian politicians declaring war on Germany too, thus giving them the excuse they needed to send in some elite forces to soften up the Italian lines</a>.
<ul><li> Then done successfully by Cadorna's successor Armando Diaz: the Italians were on the defensive and forced to mobilize their last reserves, but their main weapon factories (a major target of the Austro-Hungarian offensive) were intact and free (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">thanks to a mountain Cadorna had filled with artillery specifically for this case</a>), Germany had recalled their troops, Allied support had finally bridged the equipment gap, and Austria-Hungary had mobilized their last reserves <em>before</em> Caporetto, thus they couldn't replace the losses from their attempts at breaking the new Italian defensive line.
</li></ul></li><li> Roadrunners prefer to hunt rattlesnakes around dawn so that the snake doesn't have a chance to warm up in the sun, as cold makes them slow and lethargic. They will also make the snake strike and miss until the snake is tired.
</li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCivilWar">American Civil War</a>, both sides wanted to use this after the initial battles of the war showed that neither side would end the fight quickly. The Confederate States of America hoped to fight a defensive war until economic pressure gave them foreign allies who would force the United States of America to stop fighting. The Union's Anaconda Plan intended to squeeze the fight out of the South by taking the Mississippi River and cutting the Confederacy into pieces while blockading it to keep it from using its control of cotton to stay solvent and gain allies. The South's strategy died after the battle of Antietam gave Lincoln an opening to use the Emancipation Proclamation and focus foreign attention on slavery rather than purely economic terms.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3vomq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3vomq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3vomq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Previously Great Britain had favored the Confederacy simply as a means to weaken the United States for British economic gain. But slavery, which the British Empire had abolished decades earlier, was despised by the British people, and this not-quite-alliance had only been palatable because slavery was legal in both sides of the Civil War. Once the Union openly declared itself opposed to slavery, supporting slavers in a war against abolitionists was untenable in Britain.</span> When the South tried to alter their strategy, Gettysburg forced them back on the defensive. Over the course of the war, the North realized that since the South had so much less manpower than the North (the North could field about twice as many soldiers as the South) that it actually benefited the South more than the North for the North to continue prisoner exchanges. The resulting end of the exchanges led to the South being ground down on the defensive, facing larger manpower shortages than ever before, with no hope of foreign allies coming to their aid, debts mounting, and Sherman's March to the Sea bringing the war to Southern civilians, providing a good incentive for slaves deep in the South to run away and hurt the economy even more.
<div class="indent"><strong>General Sherman:</strong> I would make this war as severe as possible, and show no symptoms of tiring till the South begs for mercy.
</div></li><li> This was the key to Mexico's victory against France and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing">Puppet King</a> Maximillian Hapsburg during the French intervention in Mexico. A critical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine">Hold the Line</a> victory at Puebla on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CincoDeMayo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CincoDeMayo">Cinco de Mayo</a> delayed the French long enough for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a> to be organized, and also gave the Union the opportunity to turn the tables against the Confederacy. The Mexican republicans then held out long enough for a re-united U.S. to start using diplomatic and military pressure to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShameIfSomethingHappened" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShameIfSomethingHappened">"persuade"</a> the French to leave Mexico. The French public was also getting increasingly irate at the huge amounts of money the French government was sinking into the Mexican adventure, despite their inability to defeat the Mexicans, and wanting military resources focused more on the rising threat of Prussia.
</li><li> A lot of historical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSiege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSiege">sieges</a> would end up this way, especially in eras prior to organized supply trains when armies fed off the surrounding land as a rule - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StormingTheCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StormingTheCastle">Storming the Castle</a> was relatively rare due to the difficulty of attacking well-fortified positions. Many sieges were endurance contests of which side could keep their army together and fed longer before the other side gave up.
</li><li> Business competing with each other have been known to do this. For instance, business A lowers prices to undercut business B, until both businesses are operating at very low profit margin - sometimes even at a loss. The business who can keep on tanking the low margins longer will eventually win.
</li><li> This is the unscrupulous point behind <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_lawsuit_against_public_participation">SLAPP<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit">lawsuits</a>: forcing the target to put up a legal defense until the costs or stress get to a point where they just give up.
<ul><li> For that matter, many, many legal cases in the United States, both civil and criminal, never see the light of a court room as many are settled out of court before they ever face a trial. For Civil cases, this is often done by the Defense to avoid the Discovery Phase or to avoid turning a potentially unfavorable ruling that could create case law that greatly harms them. In criminal law, it can depend on how likely the prosecution is to get a conviction on the charges as well as the defense's unwillingness to risk going to jail.
