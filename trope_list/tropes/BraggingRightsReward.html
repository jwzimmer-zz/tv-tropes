<div class="indent">— 1up.com's Top 10 Videogame Resolutions
</div></div><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>The Bragging Rights Reward is a powerful gameplay reward you can only obtain past the point where you can actually make use of it, making it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>. Generally, in order to have earned the reward, you had to have proven you didn't need it in the first place.
</p><p>Such a reward is typically found by defeating the most powerful monster, beating the hardest level, clearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">the hardest difficulty</a>, earning a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayGrading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayGrading">perfect score on every level</a>, or achieving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>. It's only for bragging rights because you've already conquered the toughest of obstacles, or have already exhausted all of the game's content, making the reward mostly or wholly redundant by this point.
</p><p>The classic example is any reward you receive when you defeat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">hidden, optional boss</a> that's by far the toughest enemy in the game. This is also often the fate of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> (and making weaker weapons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Infinity Minus One Swords</a>). As an odd side effect, it will often work out that the more difficult an optional boss is, the less useful its reward will be, and vice versa. It may turn out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposelyOverpowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposelyOverpowered">Purposely Overpowered</a> (essentially the game designers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">hanging a lampshade</a> on this trope), or it may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JunkRare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JunkRare">Junk Rare</a>. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> is an attempt at getting around this, by letting you carry your new stuff into a new game where it'd actually be useful.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In some contexts, the reward might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless">Not Completely Useless</a>. Some players might derive enjoyment from using the reward when replaying earlier levels or goofing off in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">Wide Open Sandbox</a>. And even if the reward is overkill by the time you can get it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">There Is No Kill Like Overkill</a>. Generally, though, the reward would have much more practical use if you had gotten it earlier. Of course, this is not to imply that the Bragging Rights Reward is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreTools">necessarily a bad thing</a>, as to many players, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">satisfaction of accomplishment</a> is reward enough.
</p><p>Note the Bragging Rights Reward <em>would</em> be useful if you weren't already so skilled and powerful that you didn't need it anymore. If the reward isn't even nominally useful and presented <em>only</em> as proof of accomplishment, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticAward">Cosmetic Award</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Timespinner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Timespinner">Timespinner</a></em>, the final item the Merchant Crow sells is an accessory that increases familiar experience when equipped; it costs 99,999 entropy. You're not going to be able to afford it without some serious grinding for money or running through the game multiple times, at which point you're probably so strong that you didn't need more help from your familiars anyways.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>
<ul><li> The longest and most difficult sidequest in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OcarinaOfTime">Ocarina of Time</a></em>, the Skulltula hunt, rewards you with a source of unlimited money... however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing">money is useless</a> in this game, and your wallet has probably been sitting at the maximum cap of 500 Rupees for a good while at this point, if you even bothered to get the wallet upgrades.
<ul><li> <em>Ocarina of Time</em> also has the Gerudo Training Ground, which test your skill using items won from the previous dungeons. It's therefore impossible to beat until late in the game, at which point the reward (ice arrows that freeze enemies) is fairly useless. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless">Save for one otherwise very annoying puzzle in the upcoming Spirit Temple,</a> that is.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Gossip Stone:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">"They say that the treasure you can earn in the Gerudo's Training Ground is not as great as you'd expect, given its difficulty!"</a>
</div></li><li> The Fierce Deity Mask in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MajorasMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MajorasMask">Majora's Mask</a></em> can only be used against bosses, but it's so overpowered that it makes them a joke. However, unlocking it requires getting all 24 masks, at least one of which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSidequest">That One Sidequest</a>, and it can't be unlocked until literally seconds before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>.
</li><li> In the original GameCube version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWindWaker">The Wind Waker</a></em>, the Hero's Charm allows you to see enemy HP and is earned by collecting 40 Joy Pendants, an uncommon but not difficult item to find. If you're wondering why we're bothering to describe a non-example, well, the HD remaster of the game <em>turned this into</em> a bragging rights reward by instead locking it behind the Savage Labyrinth, a level similar to the Cave of Ordeals mentioned below. If you made it to this point, you've probably already memorized most enemies' HP anyway. And the thing doesn't even work on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>!
<ul><li> The original version also has a Piece of Heart at the very bottom of the Savage Labyrinth - another thing you don't need if you're good enough to obtain it in the first place. Though this was still an improvement from the downright insulting <em>10 Rupees</em> in that chest in the original Japanese version.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheMinishCap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheMinishCap">The Minish Cap</a></em>, Biggoron will upgrade your defensive item to the Mirror Shield for you if you go and do something "impressive". What do you have to do to impress him? Beat the game, by which point the Mirror Shield becomes irrelevant.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwilightPrincess">Twilight Princess</a></em> has a Poe-collecting sidequest that, like <em>OoT</em>'s Skulltula one, rewards you with infinite money. While this game <em>does</em> have more use for rupees, thanks to the invincible Magic Armor being fueled by it, it still counts as this trope since:
</li></ul><ol><li> You don't get infinite Rupees <em>on hand</em>, just have a quick source to max out your wallet, and
</li><li> The only location in the game where most players would want to use the item that benefits from the infinite money reward, the aforementioned Magic Armor, is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Cave of Ordeals</a>...but you won't be heading in with the advantage of this sidequest's reward because the last Poe needed to complete it is located on <em>one of the final floors of said 50-floor dungeon</em>.
<ul><li> <em>Twilight Princess</em>' bug hunt is a maddening example. Every unique bug you give the girl gets you money. She gives you a total of 150 Rupees for every matched male/female pair. And the reward for giving her all 12 pairs of bugs? <em>The ability to carry 1000 Rupees.</em> It would've been useful <em>before</em> she gave you 1800 Rupees. And by the time you could do this, you have been given enough Rupees to buy pretty much everything of value. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless">It does synergize well with the Magic Armor, however.</a>
</li><li> Completing all fifty levels of the Cave of Ordeals in <em>Twilight Princess</em> grants you the ability to refill your empty bottles with Fairy Tears (and fairies while you're at it) at any spring. If you were able to complete the Cave of Ordeals though, you'll likely not need the Fairy Tears for any other part of <em>Twilight Princess</em>.
</li></ul></li></ol><ul><li> The Hylian Shield in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkywardSword">Skyward Sword</a></em> can <em>seem</em> like one of these, since it's available very late in the game and getting it requires <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">beating eight bosses in a row,</a> proving you don't really need it. However, it's still useful against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>, and you can use it in another run of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Boss Rush</a>. What absolutely is an example of this trope is the reward for beating all twelve bosses, which is filling your wallet to max capacity. At this point, you probably bought everything useful ten hours ago.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">Breath of the Wild</a></em>, the strongest weapons in the game are the Savage Lynel varieties. Of course, the only places to get these weapons are by defeating high-level Lynels, who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">the strongest enemies in the game,</a> with Silver Lynels being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMooksClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMooksClothing">more powerful than the final boss.</a> And even if they weren't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse">Too Awesome to Use</a> to begin with thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons">breakable weapons</a> system, there are a handful of weapons that are slightly less powerful but <em>far</em> more easily obtainable and have more durability. There's also the Wild Armor Set, earned by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">clearing all 120 shrines.</a> There is, of course, not much left to do after that.
<ul><li> Only available with the Master Trials <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC">DLC</a> pack, the Gold Lynels are <em>even worse.</em> Like a lot of other things on this list, the spoils are worth having in theory, but in practice, <em>getting</em> them is <em>so</em> much harder than anything you'd be using any of it for, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">The Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, putting it squarely into this trope. From the same DLC, there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGearLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGearLevel">No-Gear Level</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel">Marathon Level</a> that makes the Master Sword permanently in its "unlocked" state, but by the time you're strong enough to get it, it's likely all you have left to do is conquer Hyrule Castle...where the Master Sword is already in its "unlocked" state (it does also get a <em>massive</em> increase in durability to sweeten the pot).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami">Ōkami</a></em>, collecting all 100 stray beads allows you to create an accessory that gives you invincibility, infinite ink, and a 10x strength bonus. Want to know how you get the last bead? You receive it as a gift from Issun after you beat the game.
<ul><li> Fortunately you can keep it in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>. In fact, this is the whole purpose of it.
</li><li> Likewise <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okamiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okamiden">Ōkamiden</a></em> gives you the same accessory for use in new game plus, as well as a costume of Shiranui Chibi.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em>
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a></em> defeating Galamoth, the hardest boss, gives you two Life Max Ups and a Heart Max Up, and the ability for your Mist form to harm enemies. Of course, none of them could challenge you by this point, not even Dracula himself, who isn't hurt by your poisonous gas anyway. It's basically just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">ripe</a> fodder for some fart jokes (Unless you find a certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">"well-hidden"</a> item which renders you immune to his lightning, allowing a patient player to beat him with ease much earlier).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaLamentOfInnocence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaLamentOfInnocence">Castlevania: Lament of Innocence</a>,</em> defeating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Forgotten One</a> gives you the Black Orb, which provides you with a new set of sub-weapon options. This would be really awesome, except that at this point you have already pretty much finished the game. While the Black Orb does help out against the next-to-last boss, the final boss (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Death</span>) is unaffected by your sub-weapons, rendering the Black Orb useless against him.
</li><li> Similar to <em>Diablo 2</em>, the real purpose behind <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaHarmonyOfDespair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaHarmonyOfDespair">Castlevania: Harmony of Despair</a></em> is building your characters up as much as possible, and grinding for rare drops so you can attain a full item list. Many item drops are useless, but a large number of them are quite powerful, and in turn useful for running stages faster so you can cut down on grinding time. Soma and Jonathan take it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. Jonathan's whip power is raised by leveling his 12 subweapons (5 more of which are DLC only and don't contribute to stat growth), while Soma can get up to 9 copies of <em>every enemy in the game's</em> souls, and there are over 150.
</li><li> Special mention goes to Charlotte Aulin. Her basic attack gets more intricate and deadly the more spells she knows, with 3 overall 'forms', the last of which is reserved for when you've maxed out all her spells. You can still use her for grinding money and items, but as she cannot change her basic weapon, <em>weapons do not drop for her</em>, so grinding for items is less effective than with other characters, like Soma and Alucard.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metroid">Metroid</a></em> games tend to scatter far more health and missile upgrades than any sane person would need. They're often hidden behind rather tricky challenges or difficult-to-find secret passages, but really don't serve a purpose past a certain point besides rewarding exploration and giving another percentage point towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheColossus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheColossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a></em> features a huge assortment of weapons and items, all of which can only be acquired after you've beaten the game. They can't be used in the Time Attack mode, but have some use in a second playthrough. The exception is the Sword of the Sun, which enables you to use a light beam anywhere. In this game, light beams direct you to the next Colossus or, if you're in battle, its weak points. By this stage of the game, you'll have fought all of them at least twice and know where their weak points are on both difficulty levels.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted">Uncharted</a></em>, you can't unlock infinite ammo, one-shot kills, or the ability to pull out the last three weapons whenever you want (rather than having to find them) until you've beaten the game on Crushing difficulty (in which those cheats are disabled anyway).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends">Mega Man Legends</a></em> has an unlockable Easy Mode. How do you unlock it? By beating Hard Mode, so if you manage to beat Hard Mode then you have absolutely no need to play Easy Mode. In addition, only in Easy Mode do you get the Buster MAX, which maxes out all four attributes of your Mega Buster, making it doubly useless.
</li><li> Both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LEGOHarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LEGOHarryPotter">LEGO Harry Potter</a></em> games have such a reward you can get after collecting all the golden bricks:
<ul><li> Finding all golden bricks in <em>Lego Harry Potter: Years 1-4</em> ultimately allows you to unlock Voldemort as a playable character. But he is not any different from any other dark wizard in the game, and seeing as you already require a dark wizard to find some of the required gold bricks, he is not the most useful character...except to show everyone that you finished the game at 100% completion.
</li><li> The ultimate reward in <em>Years 5-7</em> is even more useless. Finding all the golden bricks there allows you to build a golden miniature version of Hogwarts in one of the rooms of the Leaky Cauldron that continually spawns studs (the in-game currency).

However, the game can only be 100%ed by/after finishing the story, so the only things you can actually shoot with the Thunderclap are occasional Trinity patrols in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue">Playable Epilogue</a>, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoKillLikeOverkill">the mostly docile wildlife</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Momodora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Momodora">Momodora</a>: Reverie Under the Moonlight</em> you get a bonus item drop from every boss if you can beat it without taking damage. But this is a <em>hard</em> game, so if you can beat any boss (apart from maybe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmUpBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmUpBoss">the first one</a>) without taking damage, you probably don't need the extra items to beat it anyway.

When fighting the Swordmaster, Guybrush learns a unique set of insults that cannot be countered by other pirates. Using them is pointless, because they prevent you from learning new comebacks, and by the time you've met the Swordmaster the only reason you'd have to fight other pirates is to learn new comebacks.

In this case, the game can <em>still</em> be hard for players in certain games, even for a maxed-out character. The 3rd game however has a number of Super Costumes.

And in the 3rd game, one of the styles SLOWS DOWN TIME by draining your devil trigger energy. So if used together with any costumes with unlimited devil trigger, you have an infinite slow-down effect as well.

Either one of these can be abused to essentially make your invincible, but for either set two accessories are hidden somewhere in the game (one of the four being somewhere in the middle of the final boss rush) and the other four accessories are received by beating the 100 floor battle arena with 4 of the 5 characters. Easily the hardest challenge in the game, but they're still not entirely useless as you can use the infinite magic to help beat the arena with the last two characters and the final level, but all you can use the infinite super mode with is a few bosses at the end of the game.
<ul><li> The weapons you get at 100th floor of the Dark Realm from the same game count as well. Last 10 floors contain the combinations of the enemies much harder that anything you find in the game itself, including really nasty Genma Black Captains in packs, and since you cannot use them at other Dark Realms they are really pretty much just for bragging. Weapons from 50th floor are much faster to get by comparison, are not much weaker and come with magic, especially with very useful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAir">Light Magic</a> in the case of Excalibur from Soki.

Both of these are obtained at Honnoji Temple in a Demon Realm Battle Arena for both characters respectively. They're powerful with unlimited magic power and can easily wreck any boss you would use them on. The problem here is that you've obtained them in the very endgame, where you probably have maxed out everything including weapons. Jacques can at least use his on his version of Nobunaga for an easy victory so it's not <em>so bad</em> in his case.

However, since legendaries typically have unique and awesome graphics many players that have one will equip them inside of capital cities and other places with a high concentration of players, so that everyone can see that they do indeed have them.
</li><li> The Legendary Cloak questline in <em>Mists</em> zig-zagged this trope. Most Legendaries come from grinding the last tier of raids, which means you really don't need them to do the content. For the cloak, the questline started when <em>Mists</em> launched and ran through every patch since; but Wrathion upgraded the player's cloak to the Legendary <em>before</em> entering the Siege of Orgrimmar, so they had it when they needed it most... until Blizzard completely removed all the quests relating to the cloaks, so now they're unable to be acquired by new players at all.
</li><li> <em>Legion</em> introduced Artifact weapons, which (at the time) grew in power as the player used them, gaining new powers and greater stats. The developers also introduced <em>two</em> versions of this trope as well: "Hidden" skins for the weapons, and eventually "Challenge" appearances. Hidden skins could be (and still are) obtainable by everyone; some are as simple as buying the appropriate object from a shop, others involve tedious repetition until you get the drop, or worse yet, an entire hidden quest chain - by which we mean "there is no indication you are doing the right steps until you actually get the required object". Challenge appearances, however, are now <em>completely</em> unobtainable - they required the player to successfully complete an <em>extremely difficult</em> damage, tank, or healing scenario completely solo before the <em>Battle for Azeroth</em> prepatch was released.
</li></ul></li><li> Capes of Achievement serve this purpose in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Runescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Runescape">Runescape</a></em>. There's a cape for maxing out each skill, a cape for continuing to train said maxed out skills to the point where you could've used the XP to max out 7 or 8 other skills, a cape for maxing out <em>all</em> skills, a cape for completing all quests, and a cape for completing <em>everything</em>.
<ul><li> In <em>Old School Runescape</em>, Capes of Accomplishment can be used while equipped to boost the associated skill to 100 for a short while. Due to how the game engine is programmed, for any non-combat skill (Hitpoints, Attack, Defense, Strength, Magic, Range and Prayer) this is entirely useless. It will not improve your ability to perform that skill. Thankfully, it was later improved to have unique functions tied to the skill, such as Cooking making it so you never burn food (something that will happen on high level food otherwise), Construction letting you teleport to any house portals for free, so on and so forth. It also improved the Max Cape (99 in every skill) to have the functions of <em>every single Cape of Accomplishment at once</em>, making it easily the most valuable piece of equipment in the game. It can also be combined with the lava/inferno cape (the latter of which is the best offensive cape) so that it's the best cape in the game in every way. Plus, you aren't guaranteed to have done everything, unlike...
</li><li> The Max Cape, the Completionist Cape, and <em>especially</em> the trimmed Completionist Cape in particular, are this in <em>Runescape 3</em>. The Max Cape isn't too different than the <em>OSRS</em> version, though it only has the perks of three capes of your choice, rather than all of them. The Completionist Cape requires you to complete the vast majority of the game, including getting skills that go up to level 120 to that level, getting all the spells from the infamous Livid Farm (which takes a minimum of 48 hours), and other various tasks. The trimmed version requires you do <strong>literally everything in the game</strong>, including massive time sink content that provide no meaningful rewards like the Champion's Challenge (1/5k chance to get each scroll from monsters that have no meaningful drops, and there's 12 of them), killing 4000 chompy birds, 1300 black knights, and much more. What does trimming it do? Slightly changes the emote.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em> Legendary items require massive amounts of resources to create, representing hundreds if not thousands of golds invested into one item. However they are exactly as powerful as the much more accessible Ascended items, meaning there is no gain in character power for possessing one. The only real advantage of a Legendary is that it will <em>always</em> have the same stats as the current most powerful tier should the developers add a new level of equipment above Ascended.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> has the weapons and titles from Ultimate Trials, which are among the hardest content the game has to offer. The weapon itself, at least relative to the content on release, is actually identical in stats to the weapons found in the relevant Savage-tier raids, meaning there's no real reason to take down Ultimate for more power, when you've already pushed your skill and tenacity to the absolute limit trying. That said, the weapons do look cool when held, and the title you get from clearing the fight is basically a badge of honor on how much ass you kicked.

Which is great, except by the time the average player has had enough tries to finally earn it, it's fairly useless. Not to mention Wing Fortress Zone requires precision jumps, which having super speed actually hinders, and the final boss battles don't contain any rings at all, meaning you can't even use it there.
<ul><li> You can get 3 emeralds on the very first stage and there are 5 posts on the second act of Emerald Hill, allowing you to go super before the first boss. This also allows you to breeze through the levels, and is quite fun.
<ul><li> That part of Wing Fortress which requires precision jumps can be skipped with Super Sonic by jumping to the right side of the ship after the part with the three floating ring boxes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicColors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicColors">Sonic Colors</a></em> has a truly insane example that one can obtain. To obtain this reward, you have to get every single red ring in every single level, then you have to beat every single level in the "Sonic Simulator" game. There are a <em>lot</em> (180 rings, to be precise). Your reward for this? Super Sonic playable in every single level so long as you can get 50 rings. This is the first time this has ever happened in a 3D Sonic game. However, you cannot use him during bosses. What exactly can you do with this unfathomable reward? Not much, given that the only thing you can possibly have left to do since you've already gotten all the red rings is to S Rank every single mission. The reward for completing the insane task makes this absolutely trivial - usually. Using this reward negates Sonic's ability to use any Wisp power - even before collecting the 50 rings required to activate super mode. Some of their powers are replicated, but not all. As a result, large swaths of every stage are unreachable. Most stages are so short that by the time you get the 50 ring required to use the power you'll be near the goal, and some don't even have enough rings. Some stages are changed to no longer require Wisp powers, but since Wisp powers are essential to getting S Ranks and exploring and enjoying stages, the reward is purely bragging rights. It's fun, but there's not much you'll be doing with it.
<ul><li> That said, he turns the last stage into a joke, but chances are you'll have already beaten and S Ranked it with your own skill before even knowing that there was a Red Ring reward.
</li><li> And the Nintendo DS version doesn't make it any better. Super Sonic is obtained normally by obtaining all 7 Chaos Emeralds, but its only purpose is to make the true final boss accessible. As for the Red Rings? Getting them all nets you infinite boost, which you may never use anyways.

Great... except the bosses' car isn't even fully upgraded, let alone fitted with any unique parts or hidden extras. The only unique thing is the paint job.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BurnoutParadise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BurnoutParadise">Burnout Paradise</a></em> has two of these. After you get the second-to-last-level license (Burnout Elite) by beating all the events, you can give your cars a golden paint finish. If you then proceed to beat the Time Rule and Crash Rule on every single road of Paradise City, and find all the Smash Gates, Super Jumps, Billboards and Drive-Thrus, you are given the final license (Criterion Elite), and can give your cars a platinum paint job. Thankfully, you don't have to beat the events and find the discoverables on Big Surf Island to get the Criterion Elite License.
<ul><li> One such reward that <em>does</em> require the Big Surf Island DLC is the Jansen P12 Diamond car, which is awarded for clearing out all 500 Freeburn challenges in the game. Its stats are nothing special (better than the stock P12 but otherwise unremarkable).

You get the absolute best car in the game, incredibly fast and stable...after beating every opponent in career mode and winning every circuit race. And you can't use it in career mode. (So what the hell is this <em>for</em>, anyway? Extreme sightseeing?)
</li><li> The last course to be unlocked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero">F-Zero</a> GX</em> is the Sonic Oval beginner course from <em>AX</em>, which isn't even used in the Grand Prix. It doesn't even provide a major challenge, as it's just a simple oval with two turns.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicRiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicRiders">Sonic Riders</a></em> and its sequel <em>Zero Gravity</em> play with / subvert this trope. The big prize is Super Sonic (more precisely, the Extreme Gear "Chaos Emerald" available for Sonic, allowing him to go Super during the race). Both games require you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">complete every single mission with an S Rank</a>, with some of missions being already hard to complete period. As for the reward, it has its flaws: unlike other characters, Sonic needs rings to go Super (walking when out of rings, even starting that way in the sequel) and while he's quite fast in that mode, accelerating burns your rings - your fuel - rapidly. This is worse in the sequel, where using Gravity Control (essential for winning) depletes them even faster. So Super Sonic is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">Difficult, but Awesome</a> in the first game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUpLetdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUpLetdown">not so much in the second</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RidgeRacer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RidgeRacer">Ridge Racer</a> Type 4</em>, by completing Grand Prix mode with a given team and a given manufacturer, you'll unlock Extra Trial Mode for a chance to win the Devil Cars. There are 16 available (4 manufacturers x 4 teams, each with slightly different stats), and while the MMM and PRC versions are easy/very doable, the RTS and particularly DRT versions will take a lot more effort. You cannot use them in Grand Prix Mode, so in practice they're restricted to Time Trial, Vs Mode, and racing against themselves in Extra Trial; it doesn't help that the Terazzi Utopia comes with a little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> issues. This is also true for the Pac-Man Racer that you get for acquiring all 320 other cars in the game (including the aforementioned Devils).

While the villain recruitable that goes with the two is perfectly fine, the problem is is that Musashi and Black Getter are dead weight, since Musashi is stuck riding Lady Command (a support unit) and even then, he and Michiru can't ride Black Getter and by that time, you just got Getter G and heading for Shin Getter! It's even worse in <em>Super Robot Wars Alpha 3</em> - you HAVE to use Michiru and Lady Command to get it and she STILL can't use it!

By the time you get the unit (if you do it right), it's already near the end of the game and it's more than likely units like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazinKaiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazinKaiser">Mazin Kaiser</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Freedom Gundam</a> are already leveled up by then!

</li><li> True Strength, the best girdle in the game, can only be acquired by maintaining Paragon of Order status, meaning the player must be crowned a Champion of Law and must never have committed so much as a single chaotic act. Not only is maintaining this status fairly difficult due to the sheer number of actions and quests that the game considers chaotic (including several quests leading to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Ultra Ending</a>), but the reward is only gained on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">the very bottom floor of the Caverns of Chaos</a>, meaning the only real use for it is dealing with the hazards on that single floor.

<ul><li> In many of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest">Dragon Quest</a></em> games, you receive an item called the Gospel Ring which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncounterRepellant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncounterRepellant">eliminates random encounters</a> when you equip it on one of your characters. But to get the ring, most games make you defeat every type of enemy at least once, including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> and every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>, making it all but useless unless you feel like wandering around.
<ul><li> In the DS remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIV">Dragon Quest IV</a></em> there's a spell called Magic Burst that deals massive damage to all enemies. It does also count as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> because it drains all of the caster's MP, but you get it very late in the bonus chapter <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> once the secret character Psaro levels up to 60 after joining your party at level 35. Already you can only recruit Psaro after you've beaten the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a> and a difficult <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>, Foo Yung and Chow Mein. Assuming you've been steadily leveling up the rest of your party too, once Psaro is up to level 60, any random encounters are just a nuisance. Even Ammon, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a>, can be pretty easy once the average level of your party gets around level 53.</span> The only likely use for Magic Burst would be to use it to help beat Foo Yung and Chow Mein in under nine turns, which lets you get the final possible addition to Immigrant Town and is in of itself a Bragging Rights Reward.
</li></ul></li><li> During the course of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em> there are several items you that have a 1/128 chance of being dropped by a specific enemy. The most annoying to get is probably the Gutsy Bat. It is only dropped by a very powerful, rare enemy on the last screen of the game. Plus, even if you get it, chances are that Ness's Offense will already be at max!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EpicBattleFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EpicBattleFantasy">Epic Battle Fantasy</a></em>:
<ul><li> Getting the ultimate sword in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EpicBattleFantasy4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EpicBattleFantasy4">Epic Battle Fantasy 4</a></em> surely qualifies. It is a weapon that grands you 50% resistance to both Dark and Holy element, the strongest and most dangerous elements in the game, doubles Matt's attack and magic power, makes him immune to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuffDispel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuffDispel">dispel</a>, basically gaurantees to siphon enemies upon hit if they are susceptible to that status, making them unable to use skills that need MP <em>and</em> randomly grants <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutoRevive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutoRevive">Auto-Revive</a> to Matt from time to time. Where it is? At the top of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel">Battle Mountain</a>. You need to defeat upgraded version of previous bosses and evil versions of players <em>just to get there</em>, and making the weapon appear requires defeating four bosh rushes of basically anything in the game stronger than mook. Good luck.

This includes bonus bosses. The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dark Players</span> have all powerful attacks as summons, but you need to catch them (which is in their case much more difficult than just defeat them), and there is not a stronger enemy that them. However, God really takes the cake, as he is much stronger than all of them, but once you catch him, he costs 180SP to summon, much more than anything else.

Each game also awards a powerful accessory with massive stat boosts as a reward for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>, which means needing to defeat every monster and log every drop, including said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>. Once you have these, you hardly have many stronger challenges left to use them on.
</li><li> In <em>Legends of the Titan</em>, the Ame-no-Habakiri is only the second-strongest katana. Taking its place is the whole slew of Yggdrasil Weapons — one for each class — which have eight empty forge slots. Fully forging a weapon requires beating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> eight more times; to fully upgrade one of each weapon type you'll have to beat it a total of <strong>72</strong> times, and if you can do that you probably won't need those weapons.
</li><li> <em>The Fafnir Knight</em> trumps the Ameno-Habakiri with the Ragnarok sword, which offers a colossal HP and TP bonus and is usable by all classes. It's obtained by beating its strongest DLC boss on the hardest difficulty level. Of course, if you've made it that far there's nothing left for the game to offer you that would necessitate the Ragnarok.
</li></ul></li><li> Defeating the ultra-powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> in the penultimate battle at the Imperial Arena in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire">Jade Empire</a></em> earns you a superior warrior gem, the best single-stat accessory in the game. Additionally, beating the entire Arena (including aforementioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>, mind you) without losing once grants you a relatively minor stat bonus.

Though these weapons are incredibly powerful, many of them are for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">characters who are only in the party briefly</a>, and traversing the dungeon even once can take longer than they're actually there, while you only get one item on each run through. Minwu, Josef, and Ricard can at least put them to use in their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a>, but Gordon and Leila, not so much.
</li><li> Defeating the end boss of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em>. The game seemed to realize the pointlessness of giving new powers to players who'd already beat the hardest enemies in the game (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shinryu and Omega</span>), and just gave tokens as rewards for defeating them (in addition to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Ragnarok</a> that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shinryu</span> guards).
<ul><li> The <em>Advance</em> version adds the final job, the Necromancer, which is pretty powerful as jobs go. Unfortunately, to get Necromancer requires you to beat Enuo, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>, who's found at the very end of a long line of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> characters (including stronger versions of Shinryu and Omega). The game also has the courtesy to open up a final dungeon, but the Cloister of the Dead is so pathetic in comparison to what you've done before that it's the equivalent of clearing out a termite infestation with a hydrogen bomb.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a> Advance</em>, defeating Kaiser Dragon will net you the Diabolos magicite. It teaches a new spell, which would be ridiculously powerful if not for the fact that, by this point, hitting or even breaking the damage cap is trivial. Plus, there's nothing left to do but beat Omega Weapon (who himself provides nothing) or go to the Soul Shrine.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> Defeating the Ruby Weapon earned you Desert Rose, which could be traded for a Gold Chocobo, which can be used to access the supreme Knights of the Round materia. Naturally, this <em>by far</em> the most powerful enemy in the game. Note both bonus bosses are almost impossible to defeat without having the Knights of the Round materia in the first place. If you do it, however, you <em>can</em> brag. The ultimate mastered materia and Gold Chocobo are both attainable without taking on the Weapons, but it <em>will</em> take a long time, resulting in taking over a hundred hours to beat the game.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore">Crisis Core</a></em>, beating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> Minerva gives you the uber item Divine Slayer, while completing all missions, for which Minerva is usually the final milestone, gives the even more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">game breakingly</a> super Heike's Soul. If you did manage to beat her, though, there should be nothing else you need to fear anymore.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em>'s Omega Weapon gives you a item proving you've defeated it and...an item that teaches an ability to a GF. Said ability lets you use up only one spell when using "Triple" to cast a spell three times. This would be <em>amazingly</em> useful earlier, since literally all that's left to do after that is to fight the final boss. Beating the Omega Weapon also gives the player an extra menu option (hidden under a couple of submenus), which leads to a "certificate" saying that the player has beaten said monster.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em>'s Excalibur II, Steiner's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a>, is available if you get deep inside the final dungeon within twelve hours.
<ul><li> Ark gets a special mention. In order to get the strongest eidolon in the game, you have to get the Pumice. To get the Pumice, you need both Pumice Pieces. One you get from Ark the boss - which is easy enough. You can get the other through two ways: completing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalDetectorPuzzle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalDetectorPuzzle">Chocobo Hot and Cold</a> sidequest or as the rarest steal from the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>, Ozma. After that, you need to beat the other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>, Hades (who's actually scared of you for beating the last guy), and then you can synthesize a Pumice and learn Ark. Or, you can just beat Ozma by yourself in the first place and use it to beat bosses you've already beaten.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>, defeating Penance, the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> in the International and HD Remaster versions of the game, earns you ten master spheres, items that allow a character to activate any node on the sphere grid that an ally has previously activated. However, by the time you're strong enough to beat Penance, your characters' stats are probably maxed and you can easily defeat any enemy in the game. At that point, the notion that you'll need any help traversing the sphere grid is laughable.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2">Final Fantasy X-2</a></em>, there's a powerful item called the Iron Duke, which raises virtually all your stats by either 100 or 50. Unfortunately, to acquire it, you have to beat a Bonus Dungeon and a pair of bosses, one of whom has 255 in all stats. The game has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> that lets you carry over your accessories but not your levels, so it's still useful there.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em>, three particularly grueling tasks — including fighting TWO of the most powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">bonus bosses</a> available — grant you three Badges, which can be combined into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest">Wyrmhero Blade</a>, the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a>. Perhaps some context should be provided to show just how unforgiving this particular challenge is. In a game where the damage cap is 9999 (discounting the use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse">Dark Matter</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic">summons</a>), one of the two bosses you must defeat has <em>1 million HP</em>. The other has <em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladderOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladderOfSteel">50 million</a></strong></em>. Although in the latter's case, you can leave at anytime and come back, and it won't recover any HP.
<ul><li> Only use for the Wyrmhero blade is if the player really wants to go through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowLevelRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowLevelRun">low level</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">, no license board run</a>. This because while said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">superbosses</a> have predictable safe patterns that make them beatable, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> doesn't. Add the fact that the Wyrmhero blade is a "great sword" that doesn't require any license and it makes some sense to get it before the end of the game, at least in the context of this challenge...
</li><li> The issue with Wyrmhero Blade gets <em>both</em> negated and aggravated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedReRelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedReRelease">Zodiac Age</a></em> version. Here you can steal the weapon from the enemy on 50th floor of the trial mode, which is no problem at all even with the low steal rate of stealing it, as you can immediately reload auto-save if you don't succeed. The enemy in question is Famfrit, so anyhow this weapon (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheresNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheresNoKillLikeOverkill">multiple copies</a>) can be obtained <strong>much</strong> sooner than in vanilla version of the game. This, however, makes getting the copy from Yiazmat+Omega+Fishing even more pointless.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em> The Tier 3 weapons. Each one requires a component that costs a whopping 2 million gil to purchase. Since you'll never get that much cash without a ludicrous amount of grinding for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash">Vendor Trash</a>, the only alternative is to collect them as rare drops from Adamantoise. Of course, by the time you get strong enough to kill an Adamantoise, you've probably already beaten the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LightningReturnsFinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LightningReturnsFinalFantasyXIII">Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII</a>:</em> The final boss drops a unique double-bladed weapon, with good but not game-breaking stats. The base drop rate is 5%, or 15% on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> mode. If you're capable of farming the harder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> version of the final boss for a weapon ... then you really don't need it.
<ul><li> On hard mode the final boss also drops the otherwise unavailable elementaga spell. Like many of the other abilities in the game this spell has different power levels that can be improved by merging multiple copies of it together, meaning that creating an ultimate version would require dozens of separate hard mode playthroughs and final boss kills. It doesn't help that elementaga is horrendously expensive to cast, making it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em> allows you to obtain the <em>Fallout 2 Hint Book</em> after you clear the game. Reading it—and you can do so multiple times—boosts all your skills to 300% and gives you 10,000 exp. The in-game description <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">explicitly states</a> "Well, THIS would have been good to have at the beginning of the goddamn game". (The game is not designed for it if you do, though. If you hack it in to your inventory, the game won't load properly. On the other hand, if you hack it into, say, being on the ground in front of the Temple of Trials, use it a few times, put it on the ground again, save, and then proceed...)

<ul><li> Experimental MIRV. Getting it requires completing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">lengthy, unmarked quest</a>, and it uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">eight rounds per shot</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">the very expensive Mini-Nukes</a>. Incidentally, it packs about double the punch required to kill Super Mutant Behemoths, the toughest enemies in the game.
</li><li> Destroying the Citadel with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat">Kill Sat</a> at the end of <em>Broken Steel</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">permanently makes the Brotherhood hostile</a>, but allows you access to the Armory in the ruins, along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon">Callahan's Magnum</a>.
</li><li> <em>Broken Steel</em> also has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">game-breaking</a> Tesla Cannon, which is only accessible once you initiate the final quest, "Who Dares, Wins", and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll">Almost Perfect</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb">Nuclear Anomaly</a> perks when you reach the level cap of 30.
</li><li> The Search For Cheryl is one of the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>-prone unmarked quests, but following it only leads you to some minor loot from graves, and the location of a Behemoth, which you may have already discovered and defeated.
</li><li> Completing the main <em>Point Lookout</em> quest line earns you the Microwave Emitter (basically a Mesmetron on steroids), but by this time you've probably completed most if not all of the other base game and DLC quests.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> has these weapons but in different ways, economics and leveling. Many of the best weapons in the game use expensive ammo which may barely be available through scavenging. Thus, if you want to use the best weapons in the game, you must scrounge ammo and money, and one of the best ways to do that is to become effective with a less costly weapon. This is true of the previous games but the <em>Gun Runners Arsenal</em> DLC really exacerbates the issue. The DLC adds in a bunch of new weapons, many of which are unique, and ammo types to the game, none of which can just be found lying around and must be purchased. Often the player only has the wealth to use these weapons regularly when their weapons skills are so high that that extra damage you're buying is almost always overkill by that point, so even carting around some powerful guns is wasteful in the added weight alone.
<ul><li> Lampshaded in the unmarked quest "Not Worth a Hill of Corn and Beans", which requires you to collect a load of junk items to repair Camp McCarran's food processor, but only earns you a discount at the cafeteria, no experience, no caps, nada.
</li><li> Launching nukes at the NCR and/or the Legion at the end of <em>Lonesome Road</em> unlocks two rather difficult <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">bonus dungeons</a> with unique weapons and armor, but if you can conquer these, you're already powerful enough to curbstomp the opposition at Hoover Dam anyways.
</li><li> The level 50 perks are undeniably good but come on, it takes so long to reach level 50 you'll probably beat the game before that, and even if you reach it, you're obviously so strong you don't need the perks anyway. One even relies on racking up lots of karma, but by that point, you probably blew through all the big karma opportunities in the game.
</li><li> The special perk Meat of Champions can only be gotten by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">having the Cannibal perk</a> and eating the bodies of the King, Caesar, Aaron Kimball, and Mr. House. It provides +1 to Strength, Intelligence, and Charisma for a minute after eating someone's body—but Aaron Kimball can only be encountered in the second-last mission of the main quest, and he's surrounded by soldiers attending his speech (the mission meeting him involves either preventing or causing his assassination). Oh, and if you've eaten Caesar and House and you're willing to eat Kimball, chances are you're doing an Independent playthrough, in which case killing Kimball fails the quest (you can keep going from there, but you lose the attendant rewards). Chances are that if you ate the corpse of the President in front of his guards and lived to tell the tale, you aren't going to notice some measly stat boosts.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em>'s Final Judgement, a suped-up Gatling Laser wielded by Elder Maxson, is only obtainable once you initiate the penultimate main quest when siding with the Institute or Railroad, and just before you destroy the BOS airship. By the time of the subsequent final battle and/or epilogue, your stats and skills are probably high enough that you'll have little use for it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a></em> <em>VII</em> contains a Wishing Well in Eofol, which grants you a random reward ranging from free skill points to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonMushroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonMushroom">Eradi</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead">cation</a>. If you have grandmaster Protection from Magic it is basically a source of unlimited skill points, XP and gold. However, the Eofol will be the last zone you'll reach barring Shoals, and just getting there is grueling, as you need to get through Eofol Tunnels packed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">Medusae</a> immune to magic and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Behemots</a>, one of the most worrisome enemies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdinSphere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdinSphere">Odin Sphere</a></em>: The Royal Orb, an endgame-grade equipment item that is acquired from beating Churning Rift of the World. It gives as much DEF as an Ancient Crystal +2 and burns through Phozons at an abnormally high rate in exchange for a percentage increase in damage to normal attacks that's equivalent to your Level as long as you have Phozons left to burn. Unfortunately, if you're strong enough to beat Churning Rift of the World, you don't need it anyway, and unless you go out of your way to max out every single skill, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> due to how fast it eats Phozons.
</li><li> Late in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment">Planescape: Torment</a></em>, one of the earlier areas is updated to include new monsters with ultra-powerful equipment as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrop">random drops</a>. The only problem is that by that point in the game you no longer have any real use for said equipment, because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the only area left in the game separates you from your party members and contains almost no combat</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkCloud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkCloud">Dark Cloud</a></em>, you obtain the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> at the end of a dungeon only available after you beat the game. Luckily, thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingAttack">upgrade system</a>, you can get it before then — not that <em>that's</em> an easy feat.
</li><li> Every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms">Wild ARMs</a></em> game features the Sheriff Star, usually (but not always) the reward for beating the hardest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> in the game. In most incarnations, it has the power of every other accessory in the game.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms5">Wild ARMs 5</a></em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> now drops The Omega, a badge that gives 100% <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Hit</a> chance.
</li><li> It's possible to create the Sheriff Star through badge synthesis in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms4">Wild ARMs 4</a></em> and <em>5</em>. In fact, in the 5th game you can get enough materials for 1 Sheriff Star and a half in treasure chests.
</li></ul></li><li> Each quest you complete in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableI">Fable I</a></em> nets you a trophy that is in essence a useless trinket; you can't really sell them for much, if at all, and aside from an equally useless side quest, showing it off to the locals only builds up your renown, which is easily accrued by other means.
<ul><li> There was one good use for them: gold farming. Buying a house with a lot of trophy display space, decorating it, and selling it results in a tidy profit for the player. You can then proceed to break into the house, steal the trophies back, buy the house again, redecorate it, and repeat ad infinitum. Of course, the <em>money</em> isn't all that useful, either...
</li><li> In the original version, you could get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Sword of Aeons</a> after beating Jack of Blades. While the sword was twice as strong as any other weapon in the game, Jack was also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>, leaving players with nothing worth using it on. This also had the unfortunate side effect of neutering the grand moral choice of the climax, whether to kill your own sister to gain the sword. That you can't use in any real fights anymore.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableII">Fable II</a></em> has a unique crossbow that can only be gained for shooting all the gargoyles. Thing is, one gargoyle is only accessible after you've beaten the story and bought the most expensive building in the game, so by the time you get it, there's not much left to do with it.
</li></ul></li><li> A variation appears in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DotHackR1Games" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DotHackR1Games">.hack</a></em> game. It has the standard bonus dungeon at the end, which gives a powerful item for defeating the boss. By this point in the game, you're far too powerful for it to matter... except that the game is split into four games, so that the treasure won at the bonus dungeon can be carried over into the next game, where it's quite useful.
<ul><li> The second series of games (.hack//GU) has the Doppleganger, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>. Doppleganger can be fought at any time in any chapter, but the best items reduce damage to 1/4 and convert HP damage on yourself to MP damage, and require defeating Doppleganger after the end of the last game. You can't even use them unless you are at maximum level. Even if you are maximum level, all that's left is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a> itself provides better item customizations and infinite-use versions of common usable items that cannot be obtained in the main games, but all that's left to use them in is the remaining part of that dungeon.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona">Persona</a></em>
<ul><li> The Omnipotent Orb from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">3</a> onward. It's an accessory that grants its wearer complete immunity to all damage except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneElement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneElement">Almighty</a>. The player obtains it either by defeating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>, or as a 1/100 drop from a certain Persona, depending on the game. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PersonaQShadowOfTheLabyrinth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PersonaQShadowOfTheLabyrinth">Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth</a></em> gives the Orb as a quest reward for defeating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">The Reaper</a>. As amazing as this accessory is, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Bosses</a> tend to instantly kill you with Almighty attacks when having it equipped.
</li><li> The protagonist's Ultimate Persona. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em> unlock them automatically while fighting the True Final Boss of their game, while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> only unlocks Orpheus Telos upon <em>maxing out every Social Link</em> in one playthrough, which is a difficult task to achieve, making Orpheus Telos itself a Bragging Rights Reward.
<ul><li> And the Ultimate Persona from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em> cannot be registered in the Compendium, so any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Golden</a> New Game Plus allows the player to only use it between the protagonist reaching Level 93 and the end of the game.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em>
<ul><li> Downplayed when it comes to its Ultimate Persona. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Satanael</span> can be registered into the Compendium, and even with it being Level 95, the player can get use out of it for further playthroughs. A maxed out Strength Arcana allows the player to create any Persona above the protagonist's level, in exchange for a hefty price, meaning the player could create <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Satanael</span> at any point, once the Strength Confidant begins the beginning of May.
</li><li> The Eternal Lockpick, which is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">lockpick that can be re-used as often as one wants</a>. However, unless the player takes time to farm materials for it, chances are there are only one or two Palaces to complete by the time one can be created. And infiltration tools do not carry over to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, and by the time you're able to craft the Eternal Lockpick, you can get much better equipment from itemizing Personas than whatever you'd find in a locked treasure chest. So the only reason to make one is to work on the "Craft Every Infiltration Tool" achievement. This is alleviated in <em>Royal</em>, as once you make it, it carries over to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>.
</li><li> The Speed Reading book. The book is locked behind three books that each have three bookmarks in it, meaning they require three reading activities to complete. These books are also in Jinbocho, a location that isn't an early unlock, and the Speed Reading book itself costing 12,000 Yen. As a result, by the time the player has finished reading this book, there's only an odd book previously missed to read. Mitigated in <em>Royal</em> as you can check out the book from the library as early as July.
</li><li> Valentine's Chocolates from romanced Confidants. They are consumable items that fully restore the party's SP, but they are only obtained <em>after</em> the player has beaten the Final Boss.

Some of the bosses provide things like Elixirs, which are useful for the upcoming fights. But most of them provide accessories that are almost certainly outdone by anything that Sora has already found throughout the main game. The last bonus boss in particular gives the Crystal Regalia+, which gives the greatest boosts to Strength, Defense, and AP of any accessory. But this requires beating every other bonus boss first, and the last boss is quite possibly the hardest fight in the entire <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> series. If you can defeat this boss, you definitely do not need to be any stronger.

</li><li> Getting a Pikachu that knows Surf from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonStadium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonStadium">Pokémon Stadium</a></em>. First, you have to clear everything in <em>Stadium</em> to unlock Round 2, the game's hard mode, and then use a Game Boy-transferred team, that isn't registered, with any Pikachu you have in the party. Then you have to go through the R-2 Prime Cup Master Ball Division - the hardest in the game - with a Pikachu as one of your three Pokémon, which already limits your options. Using <em>Pokémon Yellow</em> cuts out having to capture a Pikachu the hard way, but you still have to pretty much clear your respective Game Boy cartridge <em>and</em> <em>Pokemon Stadium</em> and then, if you want to stand a chance, practically max out your party's levels, which is pretty time-consuming. And all of this for a single move that isn't all <em>that</em> special, and a basic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Excite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Excite">Excitebike</a></em>-esque minigame with no other rewards.
</li><li> Assist Mode in <em>White 2</em>. It's essentially an easy mode that you get by beating the Elite Four, and if you can get that far in the game, you probably don't need much help for the post-game stuff. You <em>can</em> transfer it to another cartridge that's earlier in the game, but if you use it in the cartridge that you unlock it on, it's pretty much useless.
</li><li> A lot of Pokémon (often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">bonus bosses</a>) tend to be this in their debut games, such as Mewtwo, Tyranitar, Metagross, Zygarde, Necrozma etc. These Pokémon are only accessible after clearing the main story (outside of trading), at which point there's not much they can be used for outside of Elite Four rematches (especially true for Mewtwo in Gen I, where catching it was the <em>only</em> post-game content). Later games include extra sidequests and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel">the Battle Frontier and its derivatives</a>, but for the latter most of the big-name legendaries are banned from it anyway. Non-legendary Pokémon are often more readily accessible during the main story in future games, however (e.g. Larvitar can be found in the Safari Zone in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">HeartGold/SoulSilver</a></em> long before its original appearance in the endgame Mt.

They make up for it by being very powerful Pokémon, however... it's just too bad that most of them are kept secret by Game Freak for years, meaning by the time one is revealed, you'll have likely beaten the main story, leaving it with almost nothing to do (and like major legendaries, their use is restricted if not outright banned in Battle facilities and online play). They're not even necessary to complete the Pokédex. Some of them <em>may</em> avert this depending on when they're available,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1c6r4');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1c6r4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1c6r4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As an example, the Liberty Pass in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pokémon Black and White</a></em> was distributed during the game's initial release, and can let players <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiskOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiskOneNuke">catch Victini before the third Gym</a></span> but even then they usually have some restriction (such as a gimmick OT and/or high level) that causes them to be disobedient until later on.

The stat gains showed on the equip screen are really just predictions of the effects of the auto-cast spells. Of course, Geno can give the entire party Attack and Defense Up in one turn for a piddling amount of FP, and there are two other accessories that grant instant KO protection and provide other actual benefits to boot. So unless you really need to have all three characters have instant KO protection (and you don't), it wouldn't be that useful even if you hadn't just beaten the toughest boss in the game.

<ul><li> Defeating the last <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> nets you the Tri-Emblem, a super-powerful accessory which you obviously won't need anymore. But it doesn't end here. In fact, you can go and beat said boss <em>nine more times</em> before you get, after your tenth victory, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">a totally overpowered sword</a>, which would be neat if you weren't <em>already</em> totally overpowered after going through this dungeon no less than ten times.
</li><li> This also applies to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile2Silmeria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile2Silmeria">Silmeria</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfileCovenantOfThePlume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfileCovenantOfThePlume">Covenant</a></em>. Same dungeon, same amount of runs, same boss. Quite amusingly, since there's <em>already</em> an Angel Slayer in Covenant, they have to separate the I+ 1 sword from the Hel sword by use of (TM). Yeah, they put a trademark on the real sword's name.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em> does this quite often, especially with the Training Quest rewards and the weapons unlocked by clearing the game (in Unite). The classic example is the weapons and armor you can make out of the last bosses of the game. By the time you can forge a full set of armor (and maybe a weapon or two), you have most likely already killed everything there is to kill in the game multiple times(including said last boss). This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in the description of the Azure Dragongem, a rare carve from <em>Tri's</em> Final Boss: "The fact that you are even holding this legendary jewel means you are FINISHED."
</li><li> The Dreamcast version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia">Skies of Arcadia</a></em> is notable for having an absurdly high random encounter rate. However, there is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncounterRepellant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncounterRepellant">Encounter Repellant</a> you can equip that slightly reduces the frequency of random battles. Unfortunately, you get it as a reward for finding all of the Discoveries in the game, which can take nearly forever without a game guide (and still takes some time if you have one), and which requires you to have almost beaten the game. So by the time you get it, you will have acquired the ability to fly above the clouds (which means no battles in the world map), and you will have probably beaten all the dungeons. Therefore, you have no use for it anymore.

<ul><li> The final weapon orbs randomly drop from enemies in the final dungeon (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Mana Fortress</span>). The final boss can't be hurt with the weapons these orbs power up, though admittedly he comes straight after another, somewhat more conventional boss. Besides, you'd have to go all the way back to the beginning of the dungeon just to be able to use them!
</li><li> There's also the fact that the so called level 9 weapons have no added effects like the previous levels do (save for the level 1/2 versions).
</li></ul></li><li> In the DS release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em>, you receive Crono's best weapon, The Dreamseeker, (essentially a slightly more powerful Rainbow; about 20 more power and 20% more critical hits) after beating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>. By this point you almost certainly have an attack power of 254 without it, just one point below the cap. Even if there was anything worth using it on, it still wouldn't be much of an upgrade.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EyeOfTheBeholder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EyeOfTheBeholder">Eye of the Beholder</a> 3</em> an optional dungeon called The Mausoleum near the start of the game gives you a "Rod Of Restoration" as a reward... guess where the only enemies that use what it cures are.
</li><li> Defeating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor">Devil Survivor</a></em> grants you the ability to fuse a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsDumb">massively depowered</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon">mons</a> version of that boss. At that point you <em>literally</em> have only two fights to go until the end: Not only will you be so ludicrously overleveled at that point that you could beat the game without the use of mons, but the new monster you unlocked will likely be weaker than the two (unique) demons you'll have to fuse together to get it.
</li><li> Beating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Total Pandemonium</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">enemy lair</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">twin boss at the end of it</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MuramasaTheDemonBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MuramasaTheDemonBlade">Muramasa: The Demon Blade</a></em> gives you the Narukami Bracelet, which gives you infinite soul gauge, meaning your swords never break and you can use unlimited special techniques. This would be a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>, but you've just beaten the hardest challenge in the game.

<ul><li> Sam Carter, the quartermaster at the UNATCO HQ, will give the player some extra sniper rifle ammo if the player didn't kill anyone on one of the previous assignments. Handy if you decide to change your mind about the whole 'no-killing' thing, but otherwise, not terribly useful.
</li><li> Similarly, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheNamelessMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheNamelessMod">The Nameless Mod</a></em>, you can deal with a gang in the area you start in by explaining the situation to their leader and kindly asking them to leave, and doing this gives you some ammo for your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice">signature</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">dual pistols</a> when you talk to someone at PDX. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Trestkon</a> is quick to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshade</a> how he's being given lethal ammo for solving a problem peacefully.
</li></ul></li><li> This is what the entire gameplay of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII">Diablo II</a></em> is <em>about</em>. The game goes something like this: make a new character. Beat Normal difficulty. Farm some items and levels before continuing. Beat Nightmare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumericalHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumericalHard">difficulty</a>. Farm some items and levels before continuing. Beat Hell difficulty to complete the game. Proceed to grind a specific dungeon/boss hundreds of times looking for powerful items. Trade those items for even better items. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrind">Level Grind</a> to 99 by doing a different dungeon/boss hundreds of times. Continue grinding for items. Trade more. Perhaps buy some for real money off third party item sweatshops. Eventually after many <em>many</em> hours you have the best and most optimal item setup for your character, with which you can... grind for items even faster.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII">Diablo III</a></em> introduced "Ancient" versions of legendary items, which are the same but stronger. Patch 2.5.0 introduced "Primal Ancient" versions of the same, which are Ancient items that roll with "perfect" stats, or the highest rating that stat could possibly give.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note07jco');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note07jco" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note07jco');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For instance, if a weapon would normally roll with something between 800 and 1000 Strength, a Primal Ancient item would always roll with 1000 Strength.</span>The only way to make Primal Ancient items start dropping is to beat Greater Rift Level 70, which is even harder than the game's highest difficulty of Torment XIII. While you can keep going into even higher Greater Rifts, you can't fight bosses on anything higher than Torment XIII. So you'd have to beat something even harder than the game can normally throw at you to get the best possible loot.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperdimensionNeptuniaMkII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperdimensionNeptuniaMkII">Hyperdimension Neptunia Mk II</a></em>, you get an item from the highest leveled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> that breaks your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">Damage Cap of 9999</a>. Sounds fine and dandy, but the problem is that you've got <em>the protagonist</em> who can do the same thing by placing her as a support unit.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EtrianOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EtrianOdyssey">Etrian Odyssey</a></em> games have so far played it straight, giving you the best katana in the game for beating the biggest bonus boss, leaving nothing to actually use it on. Similarly, you get an extra accessory that boosts all stats for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">recording all available items in the game</a>, which actually requires you to kill all enemies in the game multiple many times over (depending on the game).
<ul><li> Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in its third and fourth games due to the quirks of the forging system. The ultimate weapon has 8 empty forge slots for maximum customizability, but for each slot you need to use an item you sold to the shop - which happens to be the unique drop of the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>. Hence, you'll need to kill that boss 9 times in order to fully empower that weapon. It gets more tedious in the fourth game as there is a total of <em>eight</em> different types of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> that behave like that, forcing the player to slay the boss at least 72 times to get the perfect gear for their party.
</li><li> In <em>The Millennium Girl</em>, the boss drop that forms the ultimate katana will only be obtained from the fight at the conclusion of Story Mode. While this does mean that you have an entire sixth stratum to use it, none of the Story Mode party can equip katanas without assistance from Grimoire Stones. Start a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> in Classic Mode, though, and you can have a Ronin tear up enemies with that ultimate katana.
</li><li> Defeating the toughest DLC <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> in <em>The Fafnir Knight</em> on Expert difficulty awards the Ragnarok, a sword that grants a massive HP and TP bonus and is usable by all classes, while outstripping the ultimate katana. But because you've defeated the toughest boss the game has to offer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">complete with all its unfair gimmicks</a>, you've nothing left to use it on.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></em>
<ul><li> The Dragon Priest Masks. There are eight undead Dragon Priests scattered around the country. Each one is a powerful and tough spellcaster. For each one you destroy, you get his unique enchanted mask. If you collect all eight masks and place them on the special altar in Labyrinthian, you get the golden mask, Konahrik. Konahrik heals you when you're badly injured and has a chance of damaging nearby enemies, an enchantment that's not as powerful as some of the others, and not very useful for somebody strong enough to obtain it. Further making it useless, one of the masks is obtained from a Dragon Priest in the final dungeon of the main story that you're unable to return to, making it potentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Permanently Missable</a>.
</li><li> Prior to the update that lets you raise your level above 81, the Ebony Warrior was this. He will only show up once you've hit level 81 and is armed to the teeth with powerful enchanted armor and weapons, and has access to Thuums as well (he has Fus Ro Dah, and you meet him on a cliff...). He will be guaranteed to be stronger than any other enemy you face and you can loot his incredible gear afterwards. But to have reached that level, you would have had to grinded all of your skills to maximum. While it's not required to do everything in the game to get there, you pretty much have to if you don't want to spend hours grinding away. And even then it could take some time. Unless you intentionally try to summon him before everything else, you will probably not have much to do with that fantastic gear after you beat him (other than some random Radiant Quests).

You have to fight increasingly difficult enemies on the way down to Bonetail and Bonetail himself is stronger than the final boss, including having 200 HP while the final boss only has 150 HP. Beating Bonetail earns you a badge that automatically reflects half of the damage that Mario takes, but you still take the full amount of damage that the enemy deals and it only works on direct attacks, so you're better off just guarding normally (which chances are you're already good at if you finished the Pit).
</li><li> The trend continues in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario">Super Paper Mario</a></em>. Your reward for beating the Pit of 100 Trials (found in Flipside) is a Pixl that lets you move faster and it unlocks the Flopside equivalent of the Pit of 100 Trials. This is where BRR comes into play. For beating Flopside's pit, you're told to do it again. For this? You get capture cards of the party (increasing your power), capture cards of the boss (who cannot be fought again), and unlimited flip time for Mario. At this point there's really not much, unless you have yet to conquer the Sammer Kingdom duels, which becomes a bit easier. Of course finally, the reward for that is merely capture cards of your party from the previous game, which do nothing.

And in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiDreamTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiDreamTeam">Mario &amp; Luigi: Dream Team</a></em>, you have both this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JunkRare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JunkRare">Junk Rare</a> in one foul swoop, with the Mad Skillathon and Battle Broque Madame prizes being both not worth the effort to get and outclassed by items you can just buy in shops to begin with.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Boktai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Boktai">Boktai</a></em> game got really carried away with these:
<ul><li> The Azure Sky Tower. Beating it the first time was worth it, as it was only 12 floors to go up and would net you one of several rather handy gun parts (which one you got was random). Doing the trade mini-quest (which required <em>several</em> other players, games, and link cables) to get additional ones or actually building the tower up to 99 floors (Which took <em>hours</em> and you couldn't save) was not, as all you got was the handy but rather underpowered Guardian Frame.
</li><li> Similarly, the Dark Gun parts were <em>not</em> worth beating the game three times over with a good rank. They had the highest ratings of all the gun parts in the game, but were also Dark-Elemental and couldn't be used with any other parts. Since most enemies and bosses were also Dark-Elemental, the gun <em>couldn't even stun or damage them</em>.
</li><li> There is <em>also</em> the Infinite Battery (Sheesh, guys). You had to beat the game on Hard with an overall S rank and the pink solar tree obtained (which took about four play throughs already to obtain).
</li><li> Thankfully they learned their lesson by the time Lunar Knights rolled around. The Vambery is difficult and takes forever to beat, since it's a less tedious spiritual successor to the Azure Sky Tower, but the items you earn are well worth the effort.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em> throws the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmupBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmupBoss">Asylum Demon</a> at you twice. Once before you've acquired any weapons beyond a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring">dull, broken sword hilt</a>, which you're supposed to run away from, and again after you've got your starter gear and can fight him properly. If you manage to kill him the first time, you're given the Demon's Great Hammer. However, its Strength requirement is so ridiculously high that by the time you can use it, you'll have certainly found something better. For instance, the Great Club found in Blighttown is 10 pounds lighter, requires 18 less Strength to wield, and its superior Strength scaling means that if you actually <em>do</em> bother to get the obscene amount of Strength required to wield the Demon's Great Hammer, the Great Club will actually be very slightly stronger than it (assuming both are at the same upgrade level).
<ul><li> The Obsidian Greatsword is obtained by cutting off the tail of Black Dragon Kalameet, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> of the DLC. Kalameet is very difficult. Cutting off his tail is even harder. You are rewarded with an extremely powerful weapon that can do a devastating AoE attack... but you just beat the hardest thing in the game so what do you even need it for (outside of PvP and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, of course)? To make matters worse, upgrading the sword requires a special upgrade material that can only be obtained from winning PvP duels as a member of a certain covenant or as a disgustingly rare drop from a certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Demonic Spider-class</a> enemy. To make matters <em>even</em> worse, this sword has absolutely <em>no</em> stat scaling. Every level you put into Strength or Dexterity beyond the requirement to wield the sword is essentially a wasted level. If you want to use this sword <em>and</em> optimize your character build, your damage will be very poor going into the Kalameet fight, making cutting off his tail that much harder.

By the time you received the blessing, you probably wouldn't need it anyway. And to add insult to your injury, you don't even get to keep the blessing in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, you have to kill those wearers again to regain the blessing from Vendrick.

There are a lot of cards you can't get until the final dungeon, by which point you'll have most of the music tracks unlocked in the sound test anyway.
<ul><li> The infamous Pac-Man sidequest in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatenKaitos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatenKaitos">Baten Kaitos Origins</a></em> requires you to collect a copy of every quest item obtainable in the game and feed it to Pac-Man. The reward is permanent critical hits, but you can't complete this until pretty much all that's left is the final dungeon, and the final boss is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">Puzzle Boss</a> that can't really be beaten down with brute force anyway.

The Ares 90 requires two Golden Yggralith Hearts, a drop from an online-exclusive raid boss, to craft. The only way to obtain these drops offline is by purchasing them with Reward Tickets. How do you obtain Reward Tickets offline? By <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">completing the survey of Mira</a>, which rewards you with 5,000 of them. This task requires you to defeat the final boss, complete every normal and non-DLC affinity mission, plant every data probe, max out your field skills, max out most of your team members' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">Affinity</a>, and defeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Telethia, the Endbringer</a>, the highest-leveled enemy in the game, plus a majority of the Tyrants. Doing this probably required you to build a top-notch Skell that is likely superior to the Ares 90 and can handle the other superbosses better than the Ares 90.

But at that point, there's no longer any need to go fishing anymore.
</li><li> The Radiant Medal/Medal of Dawn in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsOfColdSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsOfColdSteel">The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel</a></em> gives massive stat boosts and immunity to virtually all status effects. However, getting it requires completing all quests and sidequests perfectly, even the ones that take a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> to even find. By the time you get the 430 AP needed to receive it, the final dungeon will be over, meaning that all that is left to fight is four battles, none of whom inflict status effects. It does have value in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, however, and having the Academic Rank at which the medal is awarded in a carry-over save file results in extra bonuses when starting the sequel.

Unfortunately, Scumbags are a first level enemy only found at the very starting area of the game, so by the time you reach the arena you're already high enough level that if you ever somehow found yourself fighting a Scumbag for any reason you'd automatically kill it in a single blow.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashFever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashFever">Crash Fever</a></em>: Black Jerry has some of the highest offensive prowess in the game. However, you have to get through a VERY hard stage to snag him (stages are usually rated Easy to Spectre. His is rated <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeTheRatingScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeTheRatingScale">Insane.</a></em>)

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiscoElysium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiscoElysium">Disco Elysium</a></em>, it is possible to collect a set of futuristic cheramic armor over the course of the story. The last piece, the cheramic helmet, can first be found near the very end of the story, at a point where there are no checks left for the player to roll. So the stat boosts it gives are effectively useless. The game lampshades this, too. As further bragging rights, you get an achievement for it if you've found the other three armour pieces as well.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrialsOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrialsOfMana">Trials of Mana</a></em> adds a few rewards for doing particularly challenging tasks, all of which prove you're good enough to not need them.
<ul><li> Defeating the Black Rabite gives the "Obsidian Power" skill, which reduces the MP costs of all spells to zero in battle. But the Black Rabite is Level 83, has the game's strongest skills by far, and is the game's hardest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>. In order to fight it, you have to have beaten the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> of your main character's story. By the time you're strong enough to defeat the Black Rabite, you won't really have anything left to use it on. At least the skill carries over to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, so it's useful there.
</li><li> A skill you get from Anise the Witch grants infinite item use in battle. Not only does this allow you to cover any holes in the party's line-up, it allows for infinite amounts of healing too. The only thing deflating it is that Anise is the second-most powerful entity in the entire game (surpassed by the Black Rabite alone), and you have to beat her on Hard mode in under two minutes to get this skill. And Anise is the only boss in the entire game that has more than one form, since she gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaledUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaledUp">Scaled Up</a> into a dragon after beating her human form. If you can beat Anise in less than two minutes on the game's hardest difficulty, you could already break the game in half as is without the need for infinite items.
</li><li> Finding Li'l Cactus all fifty times grants a skill that gives 200% to everyone's CS gauge at the start of battle, along with the Cactus Ring that fills the CS gauge while the equipped character walks around. Bare minimum, it's going to take the entire game to find Li'l Cactus in all fifty spots, and you'll probably have to use a guide. It'll at least let you clear out trash mobs pretty quickly with the right characters if you can use the skill, but the game is basically over by the time this can happen.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em> has dragonbone, which can be used to craft the most powerful weapons in the game. As you might expect, you get dragonbone from killing dragons, meaning that in order to get enough of it to make a weapon, you have to kill half of the most powerful monsters in the game without it. Some of the DLC makes dragonbone buyable, but it's such a small upgrade from the relatively easy to find metals on the next tier down that it's still a borderline example of this.

However, at this point, you'll have no need to catch any more of the things outside of maybe earning money for upgrades to your house/town.

By the time you've filled all the requirements to marry her (shipping one of every item, completing the recipe list, etc.), you've mostly likely done everything there is to do in the game <em>except</em> get married and have a kid. Even after you're married, she still lives in the Goddess Pond, you still have to give an offering just to talk to her, and she only even shows up in your farmhouse for special events.
<ul><li> In similar vein, marrying the Witch Princess in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonDS">Harvest Moon DS</a></em> is like marrying the Harvest Goddess. She requires several requirements, too, where marriage and a child are the only things still left to be done. The difference is that the Witch Princess does live with the player character, and has the other side-effect of the townspeople hating you because you had to kill off at least 50 of your animals, and donate a toadstool to the harvest festival for several years.
</li><li> Alisa the priestess in <em>The Tale of Two Towns</em>: She shows up later than any other marriage candidate (there's also a time range for her debut cutscene, so if you miss it, you'll have to wait another in-game year to try again.), has totally different dating mechanics than the others (she has no special date events, for instance), has the same Heart Meter of regular villagers (leading many to assume she's not a marriage candidate) AND you have to use the Wonderfuls to ask the Harvest Goddess for permission to marry her (which is a hassle in and of itself). And when it's all said and done, you actually get <em>less</em> out of a Alisa marriage because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> you can't have children with Alisa.</span>

He's also nigh-useless in dungeons as a partner. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Like Lynette, he's a member of the Sechs Empire, too.</span>
</li><li> The entire third act of the game, which starts off with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">randomly-occurring event</a>, takes you through a dungeon with <em>six</em> parts each as big as a dungeon from the former two arcs, with beefed-up enemies, cryptic challenges and brutal bosses, and forces you to fight Ragnarok, a boss who spams devastating attacks through the whole screen, to eventually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">revive Ventuswill</span>. What happens then? She and the other villagers just give you some generic thanks and life goes on as usual, no credits or ending cutscene. Adding insult to injury, Ragnarok drops the most worthless item in the entire game: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a picture of Ethelberd</span>. It sells for exactly 1 Gold, gives negative stats if used to upgrade equipment, and causes a massive drop in friendship with whoever you give it to. Even using it to upgrade a staff makes it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> at best, since it has a high charge time for a small and inaccurate magic explosion.

<ul><li> If you sell out the community center to JojaMart and buy every available upgrade, Morris gives you a vending machine that produces Joja Cola. Not really all that useful, since everyone in town but one person hates the soda, it doesn't even restore that much energy, and sells for cheap. Also, you'll miss out on the other smaller rewards the completing the bundles would give you, and the "Friendship" reward that boosts all of your affection rating with every villager by two hearts becomes unavailable. But hey, free soda!
</li><li> The secret buildings. If you complete the quest for the wizard to enter the witch's hut, he unlocks several buildings you can place on your farm. These buildings might be nominally useful if they didn't cost so much money and resources to create. The warp pillars for the mountains and the beach each cost one million gold in addition to the other resources needed to craft them. And while instantaneous warping is nice, it's to pass over a minor inconvenience, and it's possible to create Totems that do the same thing which can be used anywhere.
<ul><li> The Golden Clock is the most "bragging rights" of these buildings. In addition to requiring the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleUnlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleUnlock">Double Unlock</a> by first completing a quest for the wizard, it's the most expensive thing in the game at ten million gold, and the only thing it does is stop debris from appearing on your farm. By the time you can earn that much money, debris is a pitiful concern.
</li></ul></li><li> Completing a Secret Note challenge to reach floor 100 of the Skull Cavern earns you a maximum health boost from Mr. Qi. If you're good enough to clear a hundred floors in the game's hardest dungeon all in one sitting, you definitely don't need a health boost.

</li><li> The <em>Endangered Species</em> expansion pack does give you a worthwhile reward though. The final scenario is tougher than that of the original game, but completing it unlocks the Conservation Breeding Center, which helps endangered and critically endangered species breed easier.
</li></ul></li><li> The Truck Simulator games have a skill tree that maxes out at level 37. There is, however, no actual level cap, every level beyond the last practical one being purely cosmetic/bragging rights. Even the escalating titles max out at level 100.

<ul><li> You can unlock the headband which gives you infinite ammo by making it through the game without killing anyone. By the same token, you can get the stealth camouflage which turns Snake invisible by getting through the game without being spotted. In other words, you have to be good enough to not need lethal ammo or better stealth to get infinite ammo and perfect stealth. Oh, and using them in later playthroughs means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFairCheating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFairCheating">you won't be able to get any other emblems</a>.

They still count as Bragging Rights Rewards, because even at their cheapest, the items cost 2.5 million Drebin Points. The only way you could ever get that many DP is beating the game multiple times, and while spending as few DP as possible on anything else. So, even if you aren't good enough to beat the game with the strict requirements, you're still good enough to clear the game so many times that you still don't need them!
</li><li> At least you can actually get the bandana and stealth camo on the lowest difficulty settings and use them on the highest difficulty setting if you don't care about rankings or the emblems. If you do care about emblems, however, the Big Boss emblem is totally bragging rights-oriented. To get it, the game requires you to beat the game in under five hours, kill no one, never get spotted, never use the headband or stealth camo, and use no healing items, all on the hardest difficulty. Your reward for doing so is a facecamo that makes enemies scream or faint upon seeing you, as well as drop free items.

By the time you would be able to acquire it, your character would likely have been swimming in more than enough money to both buy the Missaglias armor set (which has the same number of health squares) and keep it repaired. Likewise, although the Sword of Altaïr is the bar-none best medium weapon in the game, it's still second to the Hidden Blade(s)' ability to fatally counter attack any non-boss enemy in the game, which is available far earlier.
<ul><li> The nature of the '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">Synchronization</a>' stat suggests that Ezio historically acquired all of them, which was confirmed in <em>Brotherhood</em>.
</li><li> The <em>true</em> example: Spread throughout the world, which spans five large cities, there are 100 feathers. They shine <em>just</em> a little bit, and are hidden in every nigh impossible spot to find. The reward one gets for finding all these (which would take anyone using a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> near two hours) is a 20 second cutscene in which Ezio's mom says thanks, then gives him the Auditore Cape, whose only function is make everybody attack him on sight. Everywhere.
<ul><li> But on the bright side, it's just about the only cape that goes well with that Armour of Altair you got earlier.
</li><li> You get an achievement for getting all the feathers (and another for wearing the Auditore Cape in every area), so this is required for 100% Completion. Take that for what it's worth.
</li></ul></li><li> And this is re-done, of course, in the next two games.

<ul><li> Getting all three endings in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalDarkness">Eternal Darkness</a></em> unlocks "Eternal Mode," where the player has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodMode">infinite health, infinite magic, and infinite sanity</a>. But, by that time, there's nothing left to see in the game. Plus, playing on the game on low sanity is arguably more fun, if only for the interesting and unique sanity effects.
<ul><li> Not to mention, having infinite health means that while you don't take actual damage from attacks, you can still be affected by damaging attacks even if they don't hurt you. If you want to run through a level and blast every creature with offensive attack spells, you'd have to keep a Shield spell active to do so... otherwise you'll be interrupted every time you try to cast. Also for the later levels, you have to manually unlock the five- and seven-pargon version of spells to use <em>everytime</em> you load a level this way (despite having them permanently unlocked by now).
</li><li> Also, Eternal Mode gives you unlimited ammo for your weapons that you gain access to across the level. It's pretty nice if you get the Elephant Gun... but not so much for the poisoned Blowdart Gun. At the very least, running through Michael's level with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">machine gun and grenade launcher</a> <em>is</em> a bit more enjoyable with Eternal Mode on, if nothing else.

</li></ul></li><li> There are two unlockable weapons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em> of this nature: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handcannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handcannon">Handcannon</a>, which can be upgraded to have unlimited ammo and have obscene firepower, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">P.R.L. 412</a>, which, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargedAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargedAttack">when fully charged</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPolykill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPolykill">instantly kills everything in the area</a>. The former is unlocked by getting five stars on all four levels with all five characters in Mercenaries mode, and the latter by completing Professional Mode, and those are the two most difficult tasks in the game—accomplishing both tasks means that you've proven that you're capable of conquering anything the game throws at you, and it has some pretty nasty things within arm's reach.
</li><li> The Infinite Rocket Launcher makes a return in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5">Resident Evil 5</a></em> by completing all chapters in less than 5 hours, you can redo stages in Level Selection to reduce the total time. By the time you made it, you probably wouldn't need it. Although it serves some good use for score farming in Professional Stage 6-2...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFrame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFrame">Fatal Frame</a></em>
<ul><li> The special function that allows the player to take pictures without wasting film. Depending on the game, it's either called <em>None</em> or <em>Infinity</em>. Depending on the game, it's unlocked by completing all Battle Mode missions with the highest rank or completing the game on Nightmare difficulty. For <em>Fatal Frame V</em>, the game had to be completed on Normal <em>and</em> Nightmare, with 100% mission completion also referring to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner">Ayane</a>'s extra missions.
</li><li> The <em>Festival</em> function is the second-best and most difficult to unlock. Its function is to maintain full charge at all times, making any shot very strong. The exception is for <em>Fatal Frame V</em>, where it merely causes <em>any</em> shot to be a Fatal Frame. For <em>Fatal Frame III</em> and <em>Fatal Frame V</em>, it's obtained by completing all missions with the highest rank — S for <em>Fatal Frame III</em> and SS for <em>Fatal Frame V</em> — and the later requires the player to have achieved that on Normal <em>and</em> Nightmare difficulty. <em>Deep Crimson Butterfly</em> allows the player to purchase the function after taking a picture of all ghosts in the game, something that requires at least two playthroughs.
</li></ul></li><li> Beating Hardcore Mode in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace2">Dead Space 2</a></em> unlocks the Hand Cannon, a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeWeapon">giant foam glove</a></em> that one-shots almost every enemy in the game (as well as not needing ammo, a very handy trait in a survival horror game). Because Hardcore mode is a separate difficulty, it's entirely possible to obtain it before you've unlocked everything, and as Hardcore mode isn't actually as hard as the game gets (it's between the top two difficulties, but you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladderOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladderOfSteel">only get 3 saves</a>), it can be used to breeze past Zealot mode. In practice, however, players who beat Hardcore mode before beating Zealot are rare indeed.
</li><li> For finding every in-game trading card in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadlyPremonition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadlyPremonition">Deadly Premonition</a>,</em> your reward is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserBlade">Laser Blade</a>: An unbreakable two-handed melee weapon with a fast attack, huge range, and the ability to down just about every enemy in one shot. However, getting every trading card in the game means doing just about every sidequest... including replaying all the combat areas one more time in order to find the trading cards hidden there. Unless you left the combat areas immediately after finding the cards, and thus forgot to pick up the <em>other</em> hidden superweapons left lying at their very ends, there's nothing left to do with said sword. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrateExpectations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrateExpectations">Except break crates.</a>

The same applies to all the clothing rewards you receive in the process of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a> of the DLC campaign.
<ul><li> The game's main campaign awards the player with access to a "Hero Replica" of one of the nine Hero Weapons if you manage to beat every single level and boss with said artillery. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSidequest">To get all nine replicas means beating every level nine times</a> for 1000% completion, and all for weapons that are just reskins of other weapons in the game. Weapons that you can easily purchase from the store after raking up cash and leveling up in online multiplayer matches, which you'd have to do anyway if you want to add the Hero Replicas to your inventory, as the award is actually just making them <em>available</em> for purchase. For example, even if you went through all the trouble of unlocking the Herobrush Replica in the store, you still have to be Level 10 and cough up 9400 Cash in order to buy the thing, those being the same two conditions for purchasing the normal Octobrush.

<ul><li> The Energy Blaster in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Odium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Odium">Odium</a></em>. By the time you find it, you're three battles away from the ending, and it's useless in one of them because the monsters are immune to it, while the second one can be easily won without using it. You'll at most use it once or twice against the final boss.
</li><li> In multiple games in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> series, it is possible to unlock certain otherwise impossible to get boss characters (usually up to and including the respective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>)... for Trial Maps, which have no experience gain, no story and no real purpose other than kicking some ass with your high-level endgame army. Oftentimes, they aren't even that much better than your actual army. You usually get these by beating the game multiple times.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones">Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</a></em>, the secret characters are unlocked by doing the Tower of Valni or Lagdou Ruins a certain number of times. The ones obtained from the Tower of Valni aren't AS bad, since it's easier than doing the ruins. The ruins a) open up pretty late, and b) are easily the hardest part of the game. The final secret character requires you to beat the Ruins <em>three times</em>. By the time you've done that, there's nothing left to do in the game.

You get it by downing and clearing a battleship, the hardest challenge in the game. This may be why the "Operation slingshot" DLC revolves around luring a battleship into a trap for an early battleship mission, where the reward shows a greater improvement.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YuGiOhMonsterCapsuleGB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YuGiOhMonsterCapsuleGB">Yu-Gi-Oh! Monster Capsule GB</a></em>, Yami Yugi's figurine can only be unlocked after training Yugi to the maximum level and using an Evolution Chip, and Yugi can only be unlocked if the player has rescued all of his friends (meaning you can't get a single Game Over in an RPG World}. Yami's tied for the strongest monster in the game alongside the Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon, but the sheer amount of effort needed to get him means that when you finally do, not much can stop you to begin with.

This means an absurd amount of grinding to even <em>approach</em> his level. Unlocking him for fusion means that your demons in stock can practically curb-stomp everything else in the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor2">Devil Survivor 2</a></em> has Alice, fought at level 99 and standing head and shoulders above everything else in the game. Fortunately, the game has several other bonus bosses who offer enough experience that the player need not grind too much on mobs to stand a chance against her. The playable version of Alice, unlocked on her defeat, isn't even the demon with the highest base level upon fusion, and only brings to the table an unremarkable passive skill.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MakaiKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MakaiKingdom">Makai Kingdom</a></em>, defeating Prinny Baal will net you the Yoshitsuna battleship, the best vehicle in the game. But you've just beaten the toughest boss in the game, so there's nothing you really need it for anymore. (And you already have a powerful enough squad to tackle anything.)

The problem was the only thing to do was to beat a few leftover missions with it. If you had already beat all the side missions before taking on the final boss, the 5-barreled shotgun got upgraded to a 5-barreled explosive shotgun. At this point there was nothing left to kill with it besides a few random bandits and innocent townfolk. To add to the awesomeness, remember that these guns were used in a game where you primarily wielded 19th century bows and rifles.

</li></ul></li><li> A few of the abilities you can get in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird">Saints Row: The Third</a></em> is abilities to reduce, and ultimately wipe, your police and gang notoriety levels. Unfortunately, your level needs to be in the high 30s/40s (of 50) to purchase them (beating the campaign will naturally put you at around level 35), you can't use them in story missions, and if you've beaten the game the streets are nearly wiped of gang members, cops, and STAG troopers, leaving the abilities useless unless one continuously plays the random stronghold defense missions over and over.
<ul><li> Notoriety wipe returns in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowIV">Saints Row IV</a></em>, and it's even <em>more</em> useless because of both your super powers and the fact that an easier and faster way of wiping your wanted level exists: Chasing down and destroying a gold ball for 20 seconds.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria">Terraria</a></em>:
<ul><li> Players often display the various armors that can be created as bragging rights.
</li><li> Banners are dropped by enemies every 50 kills, and there are banners for almost every enemy. They give you a bonus in combat with them when they're placed near you, which is useful for common, predictable enemies like zombies. Less so for obscenely rare ones such as the Nymph.
</li><li> The Axe, an electric guitar which serves as an axe/hammer with the highest Axe and Hammer power in the game. There is a 2% (0.5% in some versions) chance of Plantera (a boss who's hard to farm due to its random location nature) dropping it. It is only moderately faster than other tools of its type and has +1 to range, neither of which matters when hammers and axes simply don't see as much use as the pickaxe.
</li><li> One of the two rewards for killing the last boss, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Moon Lord</span>, in Expert Mode is an accessory that lets the wearer invert their own gravity at will. Because the player is likely wearing a pair of wings or is riding around in a flying saucer at this point in the game, and because there are craftable potions that grant the same effect as this accessory (and are actually better, since those potions allow inversion in midair, while the accesory doesn't), this item has no practical purpose. Thankfully the other reward is the best light pet in the game.
</li><li> The end game armors and weapons dropped by the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Moon Lord</span> are extremely powerful, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">some of the best in the game.</a> However, to get them, you must fight the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Moon Lord</span> and the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lunar invasion</span> several times to get the materials necessary to craft them and/or get them to drop from the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Moon Lord</span>. So when you complete the set you'll have already beaten the hardest event and enemy in the game, leaving nothing new to use them on.
</li><li> The Drill Containment Unit is the fastest mining tool in the game, but crafting it requires a large amount of almost every ore, as well as having beaten <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Moon Lord</span> at least twice. At that point, you will already have pickaxes that are only slightly slower and are much more precise, and have enough ore that bulk mining isn't an issue. It also allows for endless flight, but end game wings fly faster, as does the flying saucer which also has endless flight, and can be obtained earlier. This leaves the DCU with little use besides bragging rights or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Griefer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Griefer">griefing</a>.
</li><li> The Terraprisma is one of the most powerful summon weapons in the game, but since it is only dropped by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">Bullet Hell</a> that is the Empress of Light during during the day, when she is capable of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">killing any player instantly,</a> anyone who gets it is probably skilled and well-equipped enough to beat the rest of the game's bosses without it.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ScarfaceTheWorldIsYours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ScarfaceTheWorldIsYours">Scarface: The World Is Yours</a></em>, getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a> gets Tony's ladies to come along as additional firepower. Unfortunately, by this point you won't have any real opposition, only some weak gangs in the unsettled areas, making them a waste.
</li><li> Getting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a> on the highest difficulty in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WayOfTheSamurai4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WayOfTheSamurai4">Way of the Samurai 4</a></em> will give you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hihiirokane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hihiirokane">Hihi'irokane</a>. This piece of ore will give you one free upgrade for your weapon. However, this reward can be considered useless, as you probably upgraded your weapon to the max to beat the game on the highest difficulty already.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder22');">    Other </div><div class="folder" id="folder22" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/RecordOfLodossWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/RecordOfLodossWar">Record of Lodoss War</a></em> for the Dreamcast does this twice. Ramala the green dragon gives you random equipment during the battle; each time you hit, you gain a new item, which useful if you haven't gathered all the full armor sets yet (don't forget to go into this battle with an empty inventory). It's unlikely that you will actually <em>need</em> these armors, as many of the best are given or earned from boss fights or rare enemy encounters in previous areas. Narse the black dragon, however, is worse. Narse is far more powerful than Ramala, and requires a lot of grinding and weapon forging just to <em>hurt</em>. Prior to facing him, you must face 31 minibosses and their normal retinue. (These 31 must be faced a second time in the game's overworld to collect 31 tokens required to summon Ramala, so this is either your first or second time fighting them all.) To prove yourself worthy of an audience, you must <em>also</em> be wearing the armour of the dragon avatar, the pieces of which are found by facing 3 more super-tough minibosses. After all that work, and after delivering over 25 million HP worth of damage, Narse finally falls... and leaves you with the Dragon Killer runestone. If Ramala is still alive, this kills her in about 8 hits, which you don't want to do regardless, as filling your inventory with the best armors to sell requires some love-tapping. If she isn't, then there are no more dragon enemies in the entire game, save for the baby drakes in the ice caverns who already die in a single hit. The only bonus is that it makes for some funny damage totals on said wussy drakes (you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">max out</a> the damage counter at 99 million).
</li><li> One of the games listed on the Top 15 Worst Endings list for <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComputerGamingWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComputerGamingWorld">Computer Gaming World</a>'s</em> 15th anniversary gave the player 150,000 experience upon completion. As they put it, "for what?"
</li><li> After defeating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> in the dungeon crawler <em>From the Abyss</em>, you can send your character back to the shop owner after saving your game clear data, and he will reward you with the Rubengart ring, the best accessory in the game (+ 15 to all stats, and resistance to every element). Of course, you've already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">defeated the Abyss Demon King</a>, the most powerful monster in the land, so a few extra points to INT doesn't really mean much at this point.
</li><li> <em>Warblade</em> has a lot of these:
<ul><li> There are 36 achievements that give special, permanent bonuses for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, as well as 30 "secrets" that give you a score bonus or some unusual effect for fulfilling the requirements to. Some of these have rather brutal requirements:
<ul><li> Play 100,000 levels in total (even if you factor in a secret which adds 500 levels to this total, it should still take three weeks of solid gameplay).
</li><li> Get 200,000,000 points before level 100 (you need to be really lucky with bonus rounds and multipliers for this one).
</li><li> Get 20,000,000 in time trial mode (it's rare to get more than three million),
</li><li> Collect a money doubler with zero cash(A bit of a waste of a rare powerup, but aside from that, you can use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> to start with a money. Because of the annoying prices for things, it's difficult and dangerous to end up with no money at all)
</li><li> Complete a level in one second (good luck with that).
</li><li> Collect the E-X-T-R-A powerups in correct order (reverse order works too)
</li><li> Collect rank markers in rainbow order to get a secret which gives an extremely expensive item for free when completed.
</li><li> Rank markers in the opposite order is the secret which adds 500 levels, as above.
</li></ul></li><li> Champion Rank requires competing 24 bonus levels perfectly in a row.
</li><li> The real Bragging Rights Award is God Rank. Do get it, you need to get the six badges:
<ul><li> Get all 36 achievements
</li><li> Get all 30 secrets
</li><li> Finish a game with $999,990 (The normal maximum is $99,990. You need to do a difficult, time consuming, and seemingly unrelated process to limit break. This is also one of the 30 secrets.)
</li><li> Complete 5 Meteor Storm bonus rounds in a row with a speed percentage of 95% or more (probably the easiest badge).
</li><li> Completing just one Meteor Storm bonus round with a speed percentage of 95% or more while a powerup that reverses your controls is active.
</li><li> Finish 501 bonus levels, at least 376 of which must be perfectly completed.
</li><li> When you have all the badges, get all 30 secrets in one game. The final secret must be unlocked somewhere after level 500.
</li><li> Finally, as a very easy last step, collect all six rank markers.
</li></ul></li><li> THEN, there are the planet ranks, which are so difficult that nobody knows how to get them.
<ul><li> Says Gamewinners.com's Warblade hint on unlocking the planet ranks:
</li></ul></li></ul><div class="indent"> Get to the point where you are eligible for "God" rank, but are currently at "Champion" rank. First, have at least $500,000.

You can possess every enemy in the game to get through the stages, but achieving 100% Completion via finding three keys strewn throughout the levels allows you to possess and use <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> your girlfriend, who you have been trying to save throughout the entirety of the game.</span> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Girlfriend</span> is invincible and is the fastest and strongest character in the game, but the only thing left for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her</span> to fight is a handful of mooks in a corridor and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>. At least you get a nice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a> for your troubles...
</li><li> <em>Skullz</em> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> that is only unlocked after the final boss is defeated. Beating it nets you two new weapons, which is pretty awesome considering you've been using the same weapon for the entire game, and they both have pretty badass effects. There's nothing left to use them on except enemies, as all the bosses are defeated, and it's more than likely that your stats are just about maxed at this point.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlagueInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlagueInc">Plague Inc.</a></em> has three bonus "cheat" modes  Immune Plague (which cannot be cured), Hidden Plague (which humans never try to stop), and Unlimited Plague (which starts with enough "DNA" points to buy all disease symptoms, transmission vectors, and special abilities instead of having to earn DNA as you go). You can pay to unlock them early (for several times more than the game cost in the first place), or do it in-game by beating every non-cheat level first. On the hardest difficulty setting.
</li><li> Complete all the achievements in flash game <em>Tripod Attack</em> to unlock the "cool menu," which lets you double your damage, armor, and shields. Completing all the achievements involves beating the game and all the challenge modes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkBall2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkBall2">Dark Ball 2</a></em> you must crete a rare power up to warp into a secret level set and clear 99 levels to fight its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>. It's the only boss in the game (besides the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>) that will not give you an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpgradeArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpgradeArtifact">Upgrade Artifact</a>, just a new form.
</li><li> Some ports of arcade games and some arcade-style games start you with a limited supply of continues (often two or three) that increases the longer you play the game, with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius">Gradius</a> V</em>, <em>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HouseOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HouseOfTheDead">House of the Dead</a></em> series, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ikaruga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ikaruga">Ikaruga</a></em> being several examples. In some of these games, you can eventually unlock free play (i.e. infinite continues). However, the longer one plays a particular game, the better they tend to get at it, meaning that by the time they've unlocked the maximum credit allotment or free play, they probably don't need it to finish the game anymore.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends">League of Legends</a></em> you get gold for almost everything you destroy- enemy champions, minions, jungle creeps, enemy wards, epic monsters, turrets etc (the only exception is inhibitors since they're structures that respawn). The enemy Nexus is no exception, giving the player who delivers the last hit to it an extra 50g. But since destroying the Nexus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition">is how you win the game</a>, what are you going to spend it on?
