While it may seem silly for an already-dominant competitor to cheat anyway, oftentimes, people who are already good enough to get ahead tend to know enough of the ins and outs of what they're doing to pass off cheating as the real thing, and play for fairly high stakes. If anything, being highly experienced can prove as something of a defense; after all, if they're so good at what they do, surely they wouldn't need to cheat, so people tend to pass off extraordinary results from them as business-as-usual.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>
<ul><li> Team Rocket almost always falls victim to this (they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerribleTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerribleTrio">Team Rocket</a>, after all). For instance, they planned to steal a (then) full set of four Eevee evolutions, each one individually extremely valuable. They get three of them and a huge lead, easily enough to escape — but Jessie insists on going back for the fourth one, resulting in their capture. Other times, it's because they'll try and steal Pikachu even if they already have a chance to get away with some rare/valuable Pokémon/object.
</li><li> James defies this trope in "Off the Unbeaten Path" where he participated in an "orienteering race". Basically, he competed fairly with his Mime Jr. despite Jessie urging him to cheat like she was doing. In the end, James wins the contest and Jessie gets "blasted off".
</li><li> The entire Team averted this in an episode where one of their evil plots begins with hawking cheap merchandise at a Pokémon tournament. They make so much money doing this, they decide to call off the rest of the plan and go home winners. Of course, by the time they opened up an even bigger shop, the tournament was over and they were out of money. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Back to a life of crime</a>.
</li><li> There was also the Balloon Race episode where Team Rocket was actually winning the race fair and square before Jessie and James screwed them up by cheating over Meowth's vigorous objections.
</li><li> There was an episode in <em>Advanced</em> where James practically admits to this trope. The contest was going through a Fun House and the winner would get a year's supply of Poké blocks. Team Rocket would get ahead of the twerps in every single phase, only to wait for them to catch up so they can knock them back again. At the final phase, James admits "We could have crossed the finish line, but we wanted Pikachu and Whismur too." They end up losing again.

It doesn't work. Mifune then informs him that he was going to nominate him, but no longer intends to do so, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Danzo</span> attempts to justify his action by claiming that he had to be certain.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em>: In one of the Gosaku Ota manga chapters, Dr. Hell plots the next scheme: overwhelm Mazinger-Z with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">Macross Missile Massacre</a> as another of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast">Mechanical Beasts</a> - Deathcross V9 - attacks him, and as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> is weakened and disoriented by the constant battering of missiles and the onslaught of the Beast, shooting a freaking huge missile to finish him off. It was a good plan. It could have even worked... Should <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoDragons">Baron Ashura and Count Brocken</a> have worked together. However, they were so eager and impatient for upstaging each other they attacked separately. Brocken shot the big missile without waiting for Ashura — wasting it and forcing them to rebuild the strategy — and Ashura decided he could use that chance to defeat Mazinger-Z using the Mechanical Beast (because that tactic had worked so well in the past, right?) and humiliating Brocken.
</li><li> Alisa from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em> during a match between her team, Saunders, and Oarai Academy. Her team has numerical superiority (they outnumber the other team two to one), superior weapons and equipment and experienced tank crews compared to Oarai's new, inexperienced team and tanks rescued from the scrap heap. Despite this, she still feels to need to listen in on the other team's radio communications, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">which technically isn't cheating, but it certainly isn't cricket either.</a> This comes back to bite her in the ass when the other team, and her own team captain, realize what she is doing and both work to undo it - specifically, Oarai's leader, Miho, manages to turn the eavesdropping against Alisa by sending false orders by radio and real orders by text message, while Alisa's captain, Kay, willingly forgoes the numerical superiority to make up for the trickery.
<ul><li> Same series, the Head of MEXT School Carriers Department: Have a team of high schoolers slated to go against college-level professionals? Not enough: have it be 8 vs. 30. Have an 8 vs. 30 battle? Not enough: have it be an <em>annihilation</em> battle and not a flag battle so that the numeric advantage has maximum effect. Have it be an annihilation battle?

While the extent of his deck-stacking is only fully revealed during the battle, making it an 8 vs. 30 annihilation match alone tipped the scales so hard that all of Oarai's previous opponents (plus some others) went so far as to file <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">temporary transfers</a> to Oarai so that they could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry">join the match</a> and make the numbers even (and the wide variety of tanks that they brought also enabled them to pull off all kinds of trickery and unconventional tactics that the more homogenous college team couldn't react to). Had his cheating been more subtle, he could've buried Oarai.
</li></ul></li><li> This happens sometimes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>. The first game played in the manga was one where both players had a stack of yen bills on the back of their left hand, and the challenge was to pick up as many as possible by stabbing them with a knife without injuring themselves. By the end of the game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Ushio</a> has collected most of the money and could easily go home happy, but he instead decides that he should get all of it and tries to kill Dark Yugi with the knife. This... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatersNeverProsper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatersNeverProsper">doesn't work out for him.</a>
<ul><li> Pegasus feels the need to cheat, despite wielding a Deck of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem">custom-made, hilariously overpowered cards.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged">Zig-Zagged</a>, though, in that he's also implied to be not all that great when he can't cheat.
</li><li> Marik in the Battle City arc makes a variation that could be called "Dick Dastardly Stops to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderedToCheat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderedToCheat">Order You to Cheat</a>". During Odion/Rishid's duel with Joey/Jonouchi, the former has the upper hand and is only one attack from winning. But Marik insists that Odion uses the (fake) Winged Dragon of Ra so as to prove beyond a shadow of doubt that he is the "real" Marik. Doing so enrages the real Ra in Marik's deck, which strikes both duelists with lightning bolts from the sky, and Joey ends up winning by TKO.
</li><li> Bakura in the Monster World arc of the manga was already a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGameMaster">Killer Game Master</a> with a ludicrously difficult adventure set up, and had he let the dice fall as they may, he would probably have killed the protagonists in minutes. But since he tries to use various methods to rig the dice in his favor, those methods end up being used against him - first by Dark Yugi copying his rolling method, then by his good side using prepared supernaturally-lucky dice to roll fumbles. It culminates in one final roll where he goes so far as to seal a bit of his soul in the dice to ensure a critical success... but his good side hitches a ride on that soul-sealing and performs a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to destroy the dice and invalidate the roll.
</li></ul></li><li> Nanamine in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman">Bakuman。</a></em> is portrayed as a skilled manga artist who could more than likely end up as a legitimate rival to Ashirogi Muto if he found himself a good writer to make up for his inability to write characters with heart. Unfortunately, he's incredibly arrogant and obsessed with utilizing dubious, underhanded tactics to push his manga up in the ranks, a practice that eventually gets him banned from Jump.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OsomatsuSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OsomatsuSan">Osomatsu-san</a></em>, Iyami takes it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> when he turns a straightforward case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">Pragmatic Villainy</a> into this.

<ul><li> The Renault team hadn't won for nearly two years when two senior team members conspired with driver Nelson Piquet Jr. to deliberately crash during the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix to assist teammate Fernando Alonso to win the race. When the truth emerged in 2009 there was a huge uproar, the plotters were banned from racing, sponsors pulled out early and Renault's brand image was tarnished. Funny thing is that Alonso and Renault won the next race in 2008 (in Japan) entirely fair and square.
</li><li> Renault's forerunner Benetton tried their best to cheat despite them and Michael Schumacher being the best car/driver combination in 1994 after Ayrton Senna died. The Benetton was found to have illegal traction control software hidden in its computer. The team's left out a filter in their refuelling rig to speed up pit stops. Schumacher overtook Damon Hill on the formation lap at the British Grand Prix (when rules state no-overtaking), then ignored the penalty and was disqualified from the race and excluded from two more. In the end Schumacher won by one point over Hill after their controversial collision in Australia.
</li><li> Perhaps the most literal F1 example ever happened in the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Monaco_Grand_Prix#Top_10_shootout">2006 Monaco GP qualifying.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Simply put, <em>Michael Schumacher stopped to cheat</em> (yeah, him again). After setting fastest lap in qualifying, he parked his car against the wall running wide in the Rascasse corner and stalled his engine, which spoiled rival Alonso's faster flying lap. Schumacher alleged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">it was an accident</a>. Needless to add, it didn't fly. Cue Schumacher starting from the back of the grid. Where he finished fifth. Of course had he not stopped in qualifying, his speed in the race was such that he could still have won or at least finished on the podium.
</li><li> After clinching pole on the 2012 Spanish Grand Prix qualifying, the McLaren team forced Lewis Hamilton to stop on his in-lap because he hadn't enough fuel to get back to the pits AND produce the minimum 1-litre fuel sample to the FIA. Unfortunately, the team said it was "force majeure" (Act of God) rather than human error to the stewards. Didn't cut the mustard and he was slung out to the back of the grid as punishment. The same thing happened to Lewis in Canada 2010 which he got away with but since then the rules changed so mistakes like that don't happen again.

Knaus was suspended, the car was impounded, Johnson had to start the race from the rear of the field in a backup car — and he won the race anyway.

</li><li> In 2007, the New England Patriots were caught illegally taping the hand signals of their Week 1 opponent New York Jets. Coach Bill Belichick was fined $500,000, and the team ended up forfeiting their first-round draft pick. They were the first team to go undefeated in a 16-game regular season and ended the season with 589 points scored and a +315 point differential (difference between points the team scored and points the team allowed over the course of the season), while their quarterback Tom Brady threw 50 touchdown passes and wide receiver Randy Moss had 23 touchdown receptions, all NFL records. (On the other hand, they lost Super Bowl XLII to the New York Giants.)

Yet despite his great talent and only losing once in the Octagon (due to a disqualification in a fight he was very clearly dominating), he was caught using banned substances and was banned for a year. After serving his time, he made a triumphant return in 2017 with a rematch win over his rival Daniel Cormier who he beat the first time, only to test positive for banned substances again before the fight.

X and GX actually encourage such behavior by not only giving you an extra life if you smash five people off the track, but placing a huge RIVAL sign above the opponent who is highest on the leaderboard. Should that racer suffer an unfortunate "accident", the sign moves to the highest remaining opponent... Even then, it's still played straight if you're going on the offense: Attacking costs you speed — a LOT of it (especially the Spin Attack), and even on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Master</a> difficulty, the best way to win is simply to stay on the course, and use as much boost as physically possible whenever you can — not wasting speed to attack... not that killing your rival doesn't help, especially since the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberBandAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberBandAI">Rubber-Band A.I.</a> will often put the two of you in striking range of one another regardless of how well you're driving.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a></em> has a few such incidents, but the most obvious is the Mandalorian genocide of the Cathar over little more than bad blood from the Exar Kun rising or before. They get away with it for quite some time, but when their responsibility was confirmed by the Revanchists, the entire things blew up in their faces. Not only did they fail to completely exterminate the Cathar <em>and</em> they gave the Republic's denizens yet more reason to rally to the banner, but this proved to be such a PR explosion for Revan and his followers that the Jedi Council — which had previously been on the verge of trying to forcibly disband them — stayed its hand and allowed the Revanchists to join the fray with little more than a stern word, thus paving the way for Revan's tactics and the addition of his Jedi followers to turn the tide. Although if Mandalorian companion Canderous can be believed, this was a deliberate setup; as a culture built on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> ideals, baiting the full might of the Republic and Jedi into open war was the entire point of the campaign.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em> has this trope as its motivation for <em>eighty percent of the game</em>. At the end of Chapter 2-1, Leon has rescued Ashley and signalled for the rescue chopper, when Saddler appears and starts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Monologuing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Monologuing">monologuing</a> about his big plan, which is already complete — inject Ashley with Las Plagas and have her under Saddler's control when she gets home. He then notes that Leon can't stop him since he was injected as well while unconscious. But then, despite the fact that Saddler literally has to <em>do nothing to win</em>, his toadies show up and shoot flaming crossbow darts at them. Then they shoot down the chopper as well and proceed to try and kill Leon and Ashley for the rest of the game. Why? Because, as Saddler states just after rattling off his entire plan, he wants to squeeze the US for some ransom money before sending her back. Had he simply not given in to <em>simple greed</em>, he would have won. The worst part? If he'd had the sense to stick to his plan, he would've gained access to the <em>entire United States Treasury!</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil6">Resident Evil 6</a></em> confounds things further: It turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Resident Evil's secret government conspiracy is The Family, a collection of old-money families who have been secretly controlling the United States government and its corporations (including Umbrella) since colonial times</span>, so Saddler's bumbling is likely the result of constant panic and insanity from realizing he's trying to take over the secret rulers with a mere puppet. However, blatantly explaining his motives just makes things worse, as said rulers send in their agents to screw him over further.
</li></ul></li><li> A frequent strategy used when playing against the computer in Grand Prix mode of a racing game like the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioKart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioKart">Super Mario Kart</a></em> was to hang back a bit near the end to sabotage the leading AI opponent so that the player would gain a greater point advantage. Much like the <em>Need for Speed</em> example, this is actually much better with two players, at least before the latest version specifically disallowed this strategy. One player hugs the turns and goes for speed, while the other plays demolition derby, hangs back in third or fourth place, where they get the good weapons, and mows down the competition for the speed player.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tropico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tropico">Tropico</a></em>, the player (El Presidente) has the option of rigging elections, which moves about 10% of the votes to your favor. You can do this even if you are going to win the election in a landslide, although this will upset your people.
</li><li> The introduction of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WackyRaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WackyRaces">Wacky Races</a>: Crash &amp; Dash</em> shows Dick Dastardly zooming past all of the other racers without any trickery whatsoever — only for him and Muttley to stop so they can try to blow up a bridge. He also does this during the game, speeding ahead of everyone else fairly and then trying to cheat again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freelancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freelancer">Freelancer</a></em> has a starfighter race as a campaign mission. Near the end of the race, the other pilot will stop near the finish line to activate some turrets. (The cleaner you race — i.e., the less you bump him — the later he'll activate the weapons. A totally clean race means you'll only have to endure a couple seconds of firepower, assuming you've kept up with him.) His stopping to activate the turrets gives you an opportunity to pass him if you're behind or even with him, and essentially counts as a forfeit if you're ahead.
</li><li> In one mission in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Scribblenauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Scribblenauts">Scribblenauts Unmasked</a></em>, Maxwell and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash">The Flash</a> are in a charity race against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilKnockoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilKnockoff">Doppelganger</a> and Professor Zoom to win a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon">Starite</a>, and the latter makes several attempts to sabotage the former. They would've won legitimately had Doppelganger not made the decision to give Zoom a jetpack, which sends them flying offscreen.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic">Mega Man</a></em> series, Dr. Wily will generally insist on trying to defeat Mega Man in a final battle as often as possible, even when there is a chance for him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainExitStageLeft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainExitStageLeft">get away scot-free</a> with his dignity intact. The most blatant occurrence is when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan6">his Mr. X disguise was exposed</a>; he left in his floating chair and the game could have ended right there and then, yet he made Mega Man go through a second castle.
</li><li> A recurring theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> is the prosecution bringing on forged evidence or witnesses that are <em>heavily</em> coached, in an effort to turn a case leaning in their favor into an open-and-shut victory. Given how the series is notorious for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">Kangaroo Court</a>, just letting the current testimony stand would probably get a conviction. However, given that Phoenix and his students are infamous for their ability to nitpick an untrue testimony to shreds, this usually just gives them a big pile of ammo and casts doubt on the prosecution. In many cases, it even results in the <em>actual</em> criminal being found among the witnesses. A particular example is Manfred von Karma, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a> for being given a single penalty in a trial he won ended in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">him being convicted for first-degree murder</span>.
</li><li> Infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChallengeGamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChallengeGamer">Challenge Gamer</a> Billy Mitchell was discovered to have cheated in his attempt to be the first to score a million in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong">Donkey Kong</a></em>, resulting in him being stripped of all his scores. Many commentators on the issue noted that Mitchell was a genuinely skilled gamer and could likely have reached a million legitimately, or even just sat on his current laurels (among others, Mitchell's record for the first perfect <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacMan">Pac-Man</a></em> run is almost unanimously thought to be real).
</li><li> One of the pivotal moments in the background of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em> is the Third Holy Grail War, where the Einzbern family had the option and materials to summon a Berserker, who would no doubt possess indomitable strength, as well as very close loyalty—in most of the Grail Wars we've seen, the Berserkers dominated the war for much of its run, and this would be a Berserker backed up by an exceptional mage family operating at the height of its power. However, they instead tried to cheat and summon something outside of history and the traditional classes, convinced they could pick up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">God of Evil</a> to steamroll the competition. They actually got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDevilIsALoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDevilIsALoser">Angra Mainyu</a>, who was a random civilian condemned to death by a superstitious village for <em>supposedly</em> being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">God of Evil</a>. Needless to say, Angra had essentially no useful powers to speak of, and the Einzberns lost the Grail War almost immediately. This also had the unfortunate side effect of shoving an embodiment of evil and hatred (albeit a very weak one) inside a nigh-omnipotent wish-granting device, and screwing over just about everyone in the process (including leading indirectly to the Einzberns dying out).
</li><li> Players in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FallGuysUltimateKnockout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FallGuysUltimateKnockout">Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout</a></em> sometime behave like this in obstacle courses, stopping just before the finish line and trying to prevent people behind them from finishing the course by holding them down or throwing them off the platform. This often results in the trolling players' loss, as they wait too long to cross the finish line themselves before people running past them fill the quota of players qualified in the given round.

</li><li> Issue #4 of the Gold Key comic book (Aug. 1971) has <em>all</em> the racers employing a book entitled <em>How to Win a Race by Hook or Crook</em>, written by Dastardly himself. Penelope Pitstop would effectively eliminate Peter Perfect and Red Max by getting them to fight over her.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WackyRaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WackyRaces">Wacky Races Forever</a></em> pilot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> the hell out of this. He managed to get so far ahead of the other racers that he had time to take a nap, have a conversation with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IRejectYourReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IRejectYourReality">creatively reinterpret said executive's orders</a>, and opted to instead do some wacky scheme involving a giant cheese wedge. When Muttley tried to point out they were three feet from the finish line and could just win right then and there, Dastardly scolds and bonks Muttley, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">proudly declares they're villains</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualGenreBlindness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualGenreBlindness">therefore must cheat</a>.
</li><li> Dastardly and Muttley would later appear in <em>Fender Bender 500</em>, a series of short cartoons very similar to <em>Wacky Races</em> featuring other Hanna Barbera characters. This trope gets subverted in "The Russian Around 500" where Dick stops to cheat, ends up with his car encased in ice, and is subsequently blasted into the sky like a rocket. The out-of-control rocket finally comes a rest past the finish line in first place, handing Dastardly an accidental victory. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessTreasureTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessTreasureTwist">Alas, the prize for winning turned out to be absolutely nothing</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The same is true of the Really Rottens on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LaffALympics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LaffALympics">Laff-A-Lympics</a></em> and Phantom Phink, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardOfEvil">bearded</a> Dastardly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">expy</a>, on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YogiBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YogiBear">Yogi's Space Race</a></em>. When the Really Rottens won legitimately, they got angry when the announcers pointed it out. They're such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">Card-Carrying Villains</a> that they want to not just win, but win by cheating.
<ul><li> Issue #13 of the <em>Laff-a-Lympics</em> comic book (Marvel, Mar. 1979) shows that Really Rottens team co-captain Dread Baron is Dick Dastardly's brother.
</li><li> The most blatant evidence they care more about cheating than winning is the episode where the first half was in desert and the second in Scotland. After three of the four events, the Rottens were leading with 95 points while the other teams had 40 points each. Then the last event started: a three-legged kilt race. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">A three-legged race where the racers wear kilts</a>) The Rottens race on a threadmill attached to a car driven by Dread Baron, who produced a rulebook stating that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">for as long as they run in three-leg style</a>, that wasn't cheating. Also, Dirty and Dastardly Dalton disguised themselves as Snagglepuss and created a fake Finish Line to delay the Yogi Yahooeys. In the end, the Rottens lose 25 points for using the threadmill, 25 points for forging the rulebook that made the use of the threadmill seem legal, and 25 points for delaying the Yogis. (Who got 5 points of bonus in reparation, allowing them to beat the Scoobies for the gold medal)
</li><li> Dick Dastardly was supposed to be on the team himself, but he was cut.
</li></ul></li><li> Spike, the bulldog who opposed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TexAvery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TexAvery">Tex Avery</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Droopy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Droopy">Droopy</a></em> in various competitions, was practically built on this concept. The biggest evidence of this was the episode "Mutts About Racing", that featured Droopy and Spike as rival racecar drivers. One would think Spike and Dick were driving school buddies or something like that.
</li><li> This is parodied in the episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>, "Asspen", where Stan gets stuck in a crappy 1980s-style "win-the-race-to-save-the-old-rec-center" plot. In the final climactic race between Stan and the annoying jerk, the jerk takes a ridiculous amount of time sabotaging the course to keep Stan from winning. Of course, the jerk is an excellent skier, while Stan can barely ski faster than a crawl. He's so slow that the obstacles don't slow him down any further. He just climbs over them. Ultimately the villain is defeated by matters unrelated to the race anyway.
<ul><li> In yet another episode, Dick Dastardly and Muttley make an actual appearance, wherein they enter the Wacky Races in South Park (made up of various vehicles belonging to numerous transportation companies), and all of the adults remark how they're going to cheat like they always did. Sure enough, they do, and actually succeed in taking out two cars, although they still lose to Timmy and his Handi-Car.
</li></ul></li><li> Since Jack Spicer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown">Xiaolin Showdown</a></em> wants to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">as stereotypically evil as possible</a>, he tends to do this a lot, even when just playing by the rules will get him an easy victory. In fact, he does this in the very first showdown, where even though he could very easily just reach into the finish line, he apparently decides to summon Jack Bots to stop Omi <em>despite</em> being in the clear lead and Omi is currently using the Two-Ton Tunic, aka a Wu that weighs him down.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/COPSAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/COPSAnimatedSeries">C.O.P.S.</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassyCatBurglar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassyCatBurglar">Classy Cat-Burglar</a> Nightshade enters a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyContest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyContest">Beauty Contest</a> to get at the "fabulous prizes" offered (and to rub it in the faces of the C.O.P.S. that she hadn't done anything wrong). Naturally, she can't resist making off with the entire prize hoard. Equally naturally, once she's caught, she's informed that if she'd held off for five minutes, she would've won legitimately.

Mittens tries to tell Brain Freezer that they're already winning.

</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CowAndChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CowAndChicken">Cow and Chicken</a></em> episode featured Cow and Chicken's snail cousin, who entered a relay race because it was the only way Chicken's team would not be disqualified for not having enough members. Being a snail, he was quite slow but his opponent insisted on stopping to cheat despite the fact they could have easily won. (Even Chicken pointed it out to the cheaters. Snail crossed the finish line first <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and then revealed to have a normal set of legs and started running. He later admitted he didn't think about doing it during the race</span>.

Nonetheless, everyone else in the race took a commanding lead in their wizard-provided vehicles and robots, and only lost because they decided to hang back and kill their competition instead of, you know, just winning.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LippyTheLionAndHardyHarHar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LippyTheLionAndHardyHarHar">Lippy the Lion and Hardy Har Har</a></em> once applied for a job as truckers and, to get it, they had to defeat the other applicant in a truck race. Their opponent invoked the trope, which allowed them to take the lead, then <em>they</em> invoked the trope, which allowed the opponent to regain the lead.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> cartoon "Tortoise Wins by a Hare," Bugs Bunny's attempt to win the race against Cecil Turtle by cheating backfires gruesomely: he has his underground buddies wait near the track to beat up the turtle when he comes along, not having told them he's also putting on a turtle suit that supposedly makes him more aerodynamic. Meanwhile, Cecil is wearing a rabbit suit, so he isn't totally playing by the rules either, and he cheats more than Bugs in other cartoons where they race. Bugs' only case of the trope was stopping to put on the suit despite already being faster than Cecil. The ones beating him up only wanted to stop the turtle because they waged a lot of money. At no point was it stated that Bugs was even acquainted with any of them before the race.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SecretSquirrel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SecretSquirrel">Super Secret Secret Squirrel</a></em> was involved in a road race against a conceited Southern rooster named Hot Rodney, who hedged his bet by kidnapping Morocco Mole. Secret Squirrel rescues him but not before holding Rodney up at a staged red light. As the race resumes, the heroes are in the lead but Rodney is catching up. Morocco jettisons everything from Secret's car—including the engine, which allowed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamRocketWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamRocketWins">Rodney to win.</a> But the good guys get the last laugh as they give Rodney the booby-trapped belt Morocco was strapped to earlier.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget">Inspector Gadget</a></em> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyRacing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyRacing">Wacky Racing</a> episode called "Race to the Finish." At the end, Dr. Claw tries to win by converting his car into the MAD Jet... and <em>succeeds</em>, only to be disqualified when the announcer pointed out that his car wasn't touching the ground. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Gadget doesn't win either because he's on duty, so the win goes to one of the racers that Dr. Claw sabotaged earlier who crosses the finish line before his vehicle totals</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FilmationsGhostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FilmationsGhostbusters">Filmation's Ghostbusters</a></em> has a unique example in "The Beastly Buggy", another racing-themed episode. It's the end of the race, and the Ghostbuggy is neck-to-neck with Beastly Buggy. Mere yards before the finish, the ghostly Hot Rod decides to use the turbo boost... and <em>runs out of gas right at the finish line</em>, allowing the Ghostbusters to win the race. Unique in that Hot Rod wasn't technically <em>cheating</em> that time, even after he spent the whole episode using dirty tricks.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a></em> episode "Dexter's Wacky Races" has Mandark in the Dick Dastardly role with the show's other cast members (including Monkey, Agent Honeydew and the Justice Friends) as the other racers.

At the time Lightning Dust suggests this, she and Rainbow are not only winning, they're ahead seven-to-one to the next-closest pair. The resulting tornado nearly sends Rainbow's friends plummeting to their doom. When Captain Spitfire finds out the tornado nearly killed five civilians, Spitfire strips Lightning Dust of her rank and kicks her out of the Wonderbolts.

Beastly enters a race to determine who gets to be Leader For A Day of Care-A-Lot, and Swiftheart Rabbit has promised to give Beastly a giant head start. During the race, one of the obstacles is a hollow log they have to run through. When the Care Bears enter it, he spins it around, making them run back to the start without them noticing. At this point, he could dash to the finish. Nope; he spends time setting a trap for each bear (and given the mechanisms for some of them, they had to have taken a while to set up, even if he did prepare a little before the race as it's implied earlier), then gets lost after witnessing all of them work and ends up all the way back at the start line—just in time for Swiftheart Rabbit to start. He manages to lasso her, resulting in him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga">getting dragged through every other obstacle.</a> When Swiftheart fails to fall into the trap Beastly set up for her, Beastly crashes into it. Swiftheart stops to brag about how she's "unbeatable", runs off... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina">and promptly gets caught on a cactus.</a> Beastly, who can't believe his fortune with this, starts talking about everything he'll make the Care Bears do when he's king for a day right in front of her. While he's talking, Lotsa Heart Elephant - the only other racer remaining - passes him and is nearly at the finish by the time Beastly notices him. Upon realizing he's about to lose, Beastly runs flat out only to fall short right at the last moment. In short: He had three opportunities to win: after the trick with the spinning log, after the last trap, and after Swiftheart was caught. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">He blew them all.</a>

The Greytowers team is so much fitter than the Beanotown team (consisting of Dennis, Walter and Angel Face) that they could easily have won. Instead they cheat and, even though they initially win, they are exposed and disqualified.
</li><li> In episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DennisTheMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DennisTheMenace">Dennis the Menace</a></em>, Dennis competes in a bike race against a bully.

<ul><li> Averted in "The Great Continental Overland Cross-Country Race". Rattfink doesn't cheat at all throughout the race, but he didn't have to, because Roland's race car wouldn't even start at the starting line. By the time Roland finally fixed his car, Rattfink is just about to make it to the finish line, only to run out of gas. Then Roland speeds up, having managed to drive through the entire course in only a few seconds, and looked like he was about to win...except he accidentally pushed Rattfink's car through the finish line, making him the winner.

The henchmen actually want to sing and would just as soon do the whole thing fairly, but Two-Brains invents a gizmo to sabotage everyone else's voices. Naturally, WordGirl exposes them, but before she can cart them off, the henchmen beg to be able to sing their song, and they and Two-Brains get to perform their act.
