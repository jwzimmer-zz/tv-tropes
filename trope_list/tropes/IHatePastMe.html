The young Mendō hid in a jar until the older Mendō returned to his own time, but that experience was what gave him his claustrophobia and fear of the dark ("WAAAN!

Then she was outed as a Norma and treated as lower than trash by the Mana-using people that respected her before and then exiled. Then she came back anyway to save her sister Sylvia, only for her to betray Ange, whip her in public and said public continued to jeer on her and want her executed for existing as a Norma. Once she got out of there, Ange exclaimed that she was a complete fool for espousing such positive things for rotten people like the Mana community and if anything she feels like punching herself in the face when she remembered that past.
</li><li> Two of the Nakano sisters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheQuintessentialQuintuplets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheQuintessentialQuintuplets">The Quintessential Quintuplets</a></em> deal with this, albeit in different ways:

After she falls in love with him, she's deeply ashamed of the way she treated him and resolves to be as nice to him as possible.
</li><li> As the flashbacks reveal, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">Yotsuba</a> used to be the most selfish and competitive out of her sisters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeSpecial">wanting to stand out and be the best out of them</a>. When she started failing in academics, she turned to sport clubs, but her grades suffered for it and she was expelled from their school. Her sisters pretended to have cheated in their own exams to be expelled along with her so they could stick together, and this sacrifice made Yotsuba decide to prioritize her sisters' happiness, even in detriment of her own.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> This is a recurring theme in multi-Doctor stories, which inevitably end up with the various incarnations of the Doctor bickering with each other, such as the Third and Second Doctors in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS10E1TheThreeDoctors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS10E1TheThreeDoctors">The Three Doctors</a>" and the Sixth and Second Doctors in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS22E4TheTwoDoctors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS22E4TheTwoDoctors">The Two Doctors</a>". In the former it's suggested that the reason the Doctor seemingly can't stand himself is that he's actually more like his past/future selves than each self would care to admit.
</li><li> The First Doctor is often a notable exception, especially in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a>. Whenever a later incarnation interacts with him, they tend to see him as a voice of reason and hold him and his advice in high regard. He also has enough of a commanding presence to convince all of his later incarnations to put aside any differences they might have and focus on working together on the task at hand. An exception to this exception occurs in "Twice Upon a Time", with the Twelfth Doctor being <em>mortified</em> by his sexist former self.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho20thASTheFiveDoctors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho20thASTheFiveDoctors">The Five Doctors</a>", after the past Doctors return to their respective timelines, the present Doctor (the fifth one) says "I am not the man I was... thank goodness." This implies that while he might not exactly <em>hate</em> his past selves, he considers them phases he's since outgrown.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS21E7TheTwinDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS21E7TheTwinDilemma">The Twin Dilemma</a>", Six states that he hated having been Five, telling Peri that "he had a feckless charm that was never really (him)." In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BigFinishDoctorWho100" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BigFinishDoctorWho100">The 100 Days of the Doctor</a>", he did, however, grudgingly admit he had truly enjoyed his time as Five and compared it to "a holiday. A very wonderful holiday," and that his dislike of his fifth incarnation actually stemmed from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy">the way the universe was treating him at the time</a>.
</li><li> Likewise, Seven was not too fond of Five either, remarking that he was "bland, and not even one of the good ones".
</li><li> This is subverted in the short "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2007CiNSTimeCrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2007CiNSTimeCrash">Time Crash</a>", where the Fifth and Tenth Doctors briefly meet. Five doesn't recognize his future-self at first, and is mostly annoyed that this baffling stranger has broken into his ship and is babbling on about hair and celery. Finally, he works it out, and the two of them share a touching moment. Ten reveals that Five was <em>his</em> favorite Doctor, and he loved being him.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note01ev4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note01ev4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note01ev4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which is more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidTennant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidTennant">David Tennant</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanboy">geeking out over</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavison">Peter Davison</a>, who by the way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">is also now Tennant's father-in-law</a></span> Likewise, Five softens up and takes an immediate liking towards Ten, invested in becoming his future self one day. Unfortunately, Five doesn't learn the whole truth about Ten, and goes about his merry way thinking Ten will be a happy chapter in his future, without discovering that the chapters that precede him will be very dark, such as the inevitable Time War that will eventually scar his future incarnations, and the menacing side of Ten's personality hiding beneath the surface.
</li><li> However, in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E13JourneysEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E13JourneysEnd">Journey's End</a>", the Tenth Doctor pretty much states that he thinks he's "a better man" than the Ninth, and that his previous incarnation was more violent than him.
</li><li> Conversely, Ten shows an evident dislike for the actions he took in the Last Great Time War. Whether this is regret for being forced into these actions or outright disgust that he made so many foolish decisions in the Time War was never made clear. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This is likely due to Ten, by virtue of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox">Temporal Paradox</a>, not remembering the events of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor">"The Day of the Doctor"</a>, where he firsthand learns that neither the War or Ninth Doctor is responsible for the destruction of Gallifrey, and still views them as abhorrent.

</li><li> The Eleventh seemingly has no problem with the Ninth, however, as in the audio "Night of the Whisper" he leaves a lighthearted jest of an apology for the Ninth's ears. This may be due to the Eleventh <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">learning and remembering the War Doctor's role in the Time War, and being aware that neither he nor the Ninth did what was once thought, finally forgiving them, unlike his Tenth incarnation who harboured a dislike for his predecessor</span>.

The War Doctor is considered something of a traitor to the Doctor's legacy by subsequent regenerations, and when Eleven encountered him in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS33E13TheNameOfTheDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS33E13TheNameOfTheDoctor">The Name of the Doctor</a>", he expressed disgust.

The Doctor has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> been duplicated, making a replica exactly like the original. However, while still stabilizing, this ganger has to cope with all his memories, and starts being consumed by past regenerations. At one point he starts speaking with Ten's voice — before breaking out of it and shouting "We've moved on!"</span> It doesn't necessarily mean that Eleven hates Ten, but considering the low-point of the regeneration, there might be some hard feelings.
</li><li> Given what Eleven has said about himself <em>in general</em>, not any one specific version, it may be the fact that <em>every</em> other Doctor's face is the face of actions the Doctor detested having had to take.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/BigFinishDoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/BigFinishDoctorWho">Big Finish Doctor Who</a></em> audio drama "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BigFinishDoctorWhoSpecialsExcelisDawns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BigFinishDoctorWhoSpecialsExcelisDawns">Excelis Dawns</a>", the Fifth Doctor regards his past self as a careless freewheeler who thought he was invincible. His words strongly suggest that he was referring to the Fourth Doctor in particular. This is in response to Iris Wildthyme's remark that the Doctor isn't as fun as he used to be. The Doctor remarks that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Adric's death</span> came as a wakeup call. In the Doctor's personal timeline, Tegan's abrupt departure <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">due to her disgust at the violence plaguing the Doctor's travels</span> has yet to happen as of this story.

The reasons may be due to the Seventh's reputation as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">The Chessmaster</a>. Seven was prone to making cold, calculating decisions that would sometimes cross into greyer morality lines.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorWhoNewAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorWhoNewAdventures">Doctor Who New Adventures</a></em>, Seven in turn had issues with Five and Six. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoNewAdventuresTimewyrmRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoNewAdventuresTimewyrmRevelation">Timewyrm: Revelation</a></em>, Five represented the Doctor's conscience in his mental world, and Seven sealed him away out of what he thought to be necessity, until Ace freed him, reintegrating him into the Doctor's mind. In <em>Head Games</em>, Six represented Seven's guilt over his morally dubious actions; it took until <em>The Room With No Doors</em> for Seven to come to terms with himself on that score.

Ten and Eleven get along just fine most of the time, even moving in sync at times.

They then part on good terms with each other.</span> The War Doctor starts off unimpressed with them, thinking they are nothing more than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">Man Children</a>, and as soon as he figures out who they are (having assumed that they're future companions) demands to know if he's going through a midlife crisis. After seeing them in action, however, his opinion does a complete 180 and he considers them better than him, even to be great, remarking, "Great men are forged in fire. It is the privilege of lesser men to light the flame," with himself being the lesser man. That and their willingness to share the burden with him leads him to deciding his future is in good hands. As for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker">the Curator</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">he describes the Fourth Doctor</a> as one of his favorites, and seems amicable with Eleven</span>.

Eleven states he has nothing but contempt for One, even going so far as to glare at a psychic projection of his past self several times. When Ian tries to point out all the good things he did in his first regeneration, Eleven counters that it was he and Barbara that kept him doing the right thing.
</li><li> In the audio reconstruction of the Troughton story "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS4E3ThePowerOfTheDaleks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS4E3ThePowerOfTheDaleks">The Power of the Daleks</a>", narrated by the Fourth Doctor as if he's recounting a story from his life, he seems to regard his regeneration from the First Doctor into the Second Doctor as a significant downgrade, questioning his own decision to trade <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanAndAScholar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanAndAScholar">long white hair and cold dignity</a> for hyperkinesis, scruffiness and flamboyance. It should be observed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToHisOwnDescription" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToHisOwnDescription">the Fourth Doctor's personality is much closer to the latter type, and he also succeeded a coldly dignified, white-haired Doctor...</a> He also occasionally pauses the story to cringe about just how embarrassing his own actions are.
</li><li> Averted with the Eleventh Doctor in the Fourth Doctor audio story in which he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo">cameos</a> ("Babblesphere"), where both of them seem to like each other an awful lot  <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and the Curator, a far future Doctor who has taken on the Fourth Doctor's form and personality, seems immediately fond of and affectionate towards the Eleventh in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor">"The Day of the Doctor"</a>.</span>

And subverted with the Eighth and the Sixth  the Eighth finds him obnoxious and embarrassing as expected, but at the same time has a great deal of respect for him, moreso than any of the others do. He certainly prefers him to the Seventh.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BigFinishDoctorWho169TheWrongDoctors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BigFinishDoctorWho169TheWrongDoctors">The Wrong Doctors</a>" sees the Sixth Doctor teaming up with a younger version of himself. The older version of Six has by this point undergone quite a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterArc">Character Arc</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">has mellowed considerably out as a result</a>, and as such he finds his younger self's more unabashed and arrogant attitude absolutely intolerable.
</li><li> On the promotional site for the revived series, "Who Is Doctor Who?", a sighting of the Ninth Doctor states that he was in a heated argument with a "little man holding an umbrella", an obvious reference to the Seventh. In the novel <em>The Eight Doctors</em>, it's stated that the Seventh isn't much liked by any of his other incarnations.

However, Twelve averts this with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nine, who he describes as being nothing less than "fantastic".</span>
</li><li> In "Heralds of Destruction", a Titan Comics mini-series written by Paul Cornell, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonPertwee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonPertwee">the Third Doctor</a> meets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatrickTroughton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatrickTroughton">his immediate predecessor</a> and much bickering ensues, as it did <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS10E1TheThreeDoctors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS10E1TheThreeDoctors">when they first met</a>. Ultimately averted in that it turns out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E4TheEnemyOfTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E4TheEnemyOfTheWorld">would-be dictator Ramón Salamander</a> impersonating the Second Doctor to steal TARDIS technology.
</li><li> There is a series of three Big Finish stories featuring two incarnations of the Master, the decayed Geoffrey Beevers one and the bald Alex MacQueen one. They attempt to kill each other a few times (with the future Master having access to a device that would prevent killing his past self from also killing him) before they team up. But even when they do, they don't get along for reasons that are purely practical (as the Seventh Doctor points out, there can't be <em>two</em> Masters, it is in the name) as well as personal (twice Beevers!Master kills people before MacQueen can make a pun about their death, irritating him to no end). The MacQueen version states that if he has to be stuck with a past version of himself, he'd have preferred "the snake" (Eric Roberts), or "Mr. Velveteen" (the Ainley version) and talks about how fun it was when it was all 'pointy beards and Nehru jackets' (the original Delgado version).

<ul><li> Dr. Martin Stein meets his young self from 1975 and instantly starts to dislike him, calling him arrogant and complaining about him smoking pot and eating fatty foods. When Jax confronts him about it, Stein admits that he knows he's complaining about himself but can't help it. He also doesn't like his past self having the hots for Sara Lance, especially on the day he's supposed to meet his future wife. In a later episode, he berates his younger self (who has deduced who the older Martin is since their original meeting) for ignoring his wife in pursuit of science. That bit of advice has unexpected consequences when Stein returns to the present <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and finds he suddenly has a daughter in her thirties.</span>
</li><li> Mick Rory also isn't very fond of his teenage self when he's brought into protective custody on the ship. He doesn't try to hide his hostility - or his approval when Sara's younger self slaps the kid for trying to rather creepily hit on her.
</li><li> Inverted with Leonard Snart, who seems very fond of little Leo, still innocent before his father goes to prison and comes out bitter and abusive, forcing his son into a life of crime.

Future Ben himself doesn't seem to like his younger self either (at least before taking his advice) but this is less of an example of this trope and more of an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatesEveryoneEqually" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatesEveryoneEqually">Hates Everyone Equally</a> which, again is another reason why young Ben seems not to like his older self.
</li></ul></li><li> Dark Danny from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em>, being the psychotic evil ghost that he is, can't stand his heroic younger self or any part of his past life. He does admit at one point that he misses Tucker's sense of humor, though.
</li><li> Goes both ways in one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether">Drawn Together</a></em> episode where Captain Hero finds a way to communicate with his teenage self and decides that he is an absolute loser who deserves to be punished. He repeatedly tricks his past counterpart into performing depraved acts in public, until his younger self, realizing what a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> future Hero is, retaliates and arranges for him to be arrested. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">Played with</a> in that both versions of Hero are too dumb to quite understand the implications of them being the same character in different time periods (future hero remembers suffering similar abuse but opts for revenge by continuing the cycle instead of realising that he can break it).
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaffyDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaffyDuck">Daffy Duck</a> short <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckAmuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckAmuck">Duck Amuck</a></em>, the animator deliberately misaligns the tracking of the film so two frames of the film are temporarily visible. Daffy then proceeds to get into an argument and fist-fight with the version of himself from one frame (1/24th second) ago.
<div class="indent"><strong>Daffy 1:</strong> Listen bub, if you wasn't me, I'd smack you right in the puss! <br/><strong>Daffy 2:</strong> Don't let <em>that</em> bother you, jack!

Except Bender. Because if there's one thing Bender loves, it's Bender. Though there is one exception in "Bender's Big Score".
<div class="indent"><strong>Bender-2</strong>: Hey! Who are you?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Bender-3</strong>: <em>(dressed in a tuxedo)</em> I'm Bender from way at the end. I came back to put this rub-on time tattoo on Fry.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Bender-2</strong>: So, what are you? A butler now? "Spot of tea, please, jerkwad!"
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Bender-3</strong>: It's called class, you yokel. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a buttocks to tattoo.
</div></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> Avalon arc, the Archmage becomes quite irritated with his younger self for being impulsive and not thinking things through. He takes it upon himself to tutor the younger him, and frequently makes jabs about how incompetent he is. The difference in time between the two is a matter of <em>hours</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GeneratorRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GeneratorRex">Generator Rex</a></em>, the eponymous character, suffering from chronic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">Laser-Guided Amnesia</a>, finds out that he once sold out his best friends to a crime boss. Also, though he never mentions <em>hating</em> it, per se, Six was a cold-hearted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> and wannabe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">Casanova</a> before he met Rex, and reverts to this when he loses six years of memory. In an odd inversion of the trope, Six decides to try turning his life (back)around when he sees the admiration Rex had for his past "future" self.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VandalSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VandalSavage">Vandal Savage</a> in the episode "Hereafter". It took 30,000 years of self-imposed exile on the ruined Earth (which he ruined) as the last human being alive for him to give up his megalomania. As Savage prepares to send <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> back in time, Savage tells Superman that he must stop Savage's past self no matter what.
</li><li> In the <em>Unlimited</em> episode "The Once and Future Thing: Time Warped" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">old Bruce Wayne</a> meets his past self and, during a suspect's interrogation, comments that "I can't believe I was ever that green." Afterwards, Old Bruce teaches his past self how to properly interrogate a criminal, foregoing the traditional method of terrifying the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mook</a> and instead simply <em>beating</em> information out of him. This leads to an amusing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodCopBadCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodCopBadCop">Good Cop/Bad Cop</a> with Batman playing both roles, and past Batman's teammates expressing their disbelief at the Batman they know being able to pull off Good Cop.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeagueAction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeagueAction">Justice League Action</a></em>: Downplayed example in "Time Share". Blue Beetle and Batman travel to the past to prevent Chronos from causing havoc with Batman's past. The two end up encountering the past Batman, who is living out of his car, without his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrapplingHookGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrapplingHookGun">Grappling-Hook Gun</a> and saying cheesy lines and posing. Present Day Bats is clearly embarrassed by this phase of his career. Especially when the younger Batman does the classic 'I am the night' rooftop pose, mere minutes after Batman told Beetle that heroes do <em>not</em> pose. Blue Beetle makes sure Scarab took a picture.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> episode "It's About Time", while it isn't hate, Twilight is frustrated upon the realization that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a> she just created could have been avoided if her past self had just shut up for five seconds.

During a dream sequence in one episode, he even comes face to face with his younger self and they argue. Eventually a copy of his younger self joins the cast and Matrix treats him like an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling">Annoying Younger Sibling</a>. The relationship is eventually inverted. Despite initially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWorship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWorship">worshipping</a> his future self, copy Enzo grows to dislike Matrix's bitterness, while Matrix tries to regain some of the idealism of his youth.

However, Past!Cartman doesn't believe Future!Cartman, and just insults him. This leads to Future!Cartman calling his past self an asshole. Then at the end of the episode, when Cartman is clearly going to do the whole mess again, he gets a call from his future self and acts exactly the same way.
</li><li> In the Season 21 finale, Heidi reminisces about the early stages of her relationship with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cartman</span>, and is disgusted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecameTheirOwnAntithesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecameTheirOwnAntithesis">how nice and caring she was back then</a>.
