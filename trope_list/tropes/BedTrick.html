In short, "My God, Who Have I Done?"
</p><p>In the classic version which gave this trope its name, Carol accomplishes her coup by slipping into bed with Bob after dark; Bob is typically too sleepy to notice the difference. This can be justified in cases where Bob and Alice have never slept together before, but if Bob and Alice are married it strains the audience's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief">Willing Suspension of Disbelief</a> (he can't tell the difference between Carol and his wife of five years?). Historically, it was commonly used the other way round: Carol, as the wife that Bob rejected, took the place of Alice, who was desperate to escape Bob's wooing. Nowadays it's achieved by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshiftingSeducer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshiftingSeducer">shapeshifting</a> or some other device by which Carol could plausibly fool Bob into believing that she is Alice.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>This is one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestTricksInTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestTricksInTheBook">The Oldest Tricks in the Book</a> and a common origin story for mythological heroes (often with a god playing the role of Carol). As a general rule, the farther back you go in time, the more likely it is that the person you're sleeping with isn't who you think they are, though it's seen something of a revival in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">Soap Operas</a> (usually with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">added justification</a> that the person being fooled is drunk).
</p><p>For once, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfInverseFertility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfInverseFertility">Law of Inverse Fertility</a> is inverted: a woman who uses this to try to get pregnant is likely to pull it off, even after one time in bed.
</p><p>When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, expect Carol-as-Alice to be much better in bed than the real Alice. If it's Dan impersonating Bob, expect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetterInBed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetterInBed">Alice to notice "Bob" has grown a few inches</a>, especially if it's a parody. For cases when Bob suspects something, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotRightInTheBed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotRightInTheBed">Not Right in the Bed</a>. (A rather twisted case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotTheImposter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotTheImposter">Spot the Imposter</a> in both cases.) Basically, a sub-category for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedyRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedyRape">Black Comedy Rape</a>.

</p><p>This is basically the definition of <strong>rape by deception</strong> (or rape by fraud), though that crime can also include situations like doctors performing unnecessarily invasive sexual acts on patients while claiming that they're necessary for diagnosis or treatment. Most areas do not recognize this as a crime, but in the U.S. under expanding federal definitions of rape to include any non-consensual penetration, it may qualify and be prosecuted in the same vein as all other forms of rape. In other words, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotTryThisAtHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotTryThisAtHome">Do Not Try This at Home</a>. Seriously. We mean it.

</li><li> In the Spanish ballad "La Servana" the queen pulls this on the king to prevent him from sleeping with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest">their daughter</a> Servana. When the king notices that 'Servana' isn't a virgin, the queen says "off course I'm not, how could I be?" and promptly lists all her children,including the aforementioned daughter.

At one point, Xavin tried appearing as Nico because they thought that this was what Karolina really wanted and that it would help Karolina deal with her emotions. It did not work; Karolina thought it was "some kind of sick test". Xavin, not being from around here, is somewhat baffled.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SubMariner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SubMariner">Sub-Mariner</a></em>. Lemurian supervillainess Lyra tricked Namor into sleeping with her by disguising herself as Susan Richards.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em>, a Skrull secret agent named Lyja the Lazerfist fooled Johnny into first sleeping with and later marrying her by posing as the Thing's ex-girlfriend, Alicia Masters. The marriage lasted years.
</li><li> Also from Marvel, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHercules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHercules">Hercules</a>, as part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme">Zany Scheme</a> involving him pretending to be Thor, ended up sleeping with the queen of the Dark Elves. However, it's clear that Alflyse had sex with him because she was incredibly attracted to him and his macho mannerisms, rather than because he was posing as Thor. It's also not entirely clear whether or not she already knew he wasn't Thor and was just playing along—she certainly doesn't seem at all upset when the truth comes out, and happily sleeps with him again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> One of his enemies, the Chameleon, impersonated Spidey and slept with his roommate. Somewhat unusual in that this is being played up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem">as an inconvenience to Peter</a>.
</li><li> The Chameleon once attempted to do this to Mary Jane (as in the above case he was disguised as Peter), only to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">defied</a>. When he kisses her, she realizes it isn't him (with an extra spewing of information Peter should have known to be false to make sure), and then proceeded to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatterUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatterUp">beat him senseless with a baseball bat</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorOctopus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorOctopus">Doctor Octopus</a> did a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">Grand Theft Me</a> on Peter, and tried to get fresh with Mary Jane as well. She felt something was off because Peter wasn't himself (plus they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OneMoreDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OneMoreDay">no longer together</a>) and Doc Oc gave up his attempts. He tried again later with another woman, Anna Maria, who had no clue about anything. When Peter got back his body and let her in on everything, she was quite stunned by what had gone on. When Otto later on comes back from death (kinda, it's actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">a mental duplicate</a>) and tries to be a hero again, he even starts mentally kicking himself for denying her the full knowledge needed to make a consientous choice.
</li><li> The second Kraven the Hunter, Alyosha, had slept with Calypso—and only told her he wasn't Sergei while mocking her in the afterglow.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em>, Wolverine attempts this with Mary Jane after he and Peter are body-swapped. MJ declines to go through with it, however, wanting to wait.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans">Dick Grayson</a> was once seduced by the shape-shifting Mirage in the form of his girlfriend Koriand'r/Starfire. This was a large factor in them subsequently breaking up. Mirage even goes so far as to taunt Dick for not noticing the difference.
</li><li> Brazilian newspaper comic <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Aline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Aline">Aline</a></em> had one of the Aline's boyfriends disguising himself as her to trick a lesbian who had a crush on Aline.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TyphoidMaryMarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TyphoidMaryMarvelComics">Typhoid Mary</a> pulls this on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a> by disguising herself as Siryn. He does not take it well.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XFactor">X-Factor</a></em>, Multiple Man awakens one morning to find that one of his dupes got out accidentally and has been, uhm, enjoying himself. Later, Siryn and M separately tell him how wonderful the night before was, indicating that he slept with one while the dupe got with the other, pretending to be him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It later turns out they <em>both</em> slept with dupes, and that a dupe managed to get Siryn pregnant.</span> Sort of a borderline example; no one was tricking anyone else. Jamie and his dupes tend to get confused about who did what, since they're born with all his memories, and when he reabsorbs them, he remembers what they did as if he himself did it.
<ul><li> That hadn't even been the first time Siryn had slept with a duplicate of Jamie without realizing it. Seeing how mad she had gotten when he told her what had happened, the first time around, it's kind of frustrating that she fell for the exact same "trick" a second time.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Mystique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Mystique">Mystique</a> does this a lot, usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>:
<ul><li> She created a new identity in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> as a student known as Foxx, in order to seduce Gambit and break him and Rogue up. Later, when Gambit realizes who she is, she tries to seduce him again by taking Rogue's form and telling him that it wouldn't be cheating if they had sex while she appeared as Rogue.
</li><li> Mystique is fond of this trope. In a Nightcrawler backstory, Mystique shapeshifts into a frigid maid to sleep with the driver and convinces him to sneak into the castle later that night and asks him to wake her up with sex... all so she can watch the driver be thrown from the house after the maid screams rape when he crawls into her bed that night.

</li><li> Reversed in an old story. A fairy/magic/sorcerer-king needs an enemy defeated, and can't do it himself. He enlists the help of a human king/nobleman. The sorcerer-king uses his powers to make each look exactly like the other and gives the human king specific instructions on how to defeat the enemy, and specific permission to use anything and everything he owns as though it actually belongs to the human king—including the sorcerer-king's <em>wife</em>. The human king does as he's bid, but lays a sword or bolster down between him and the fairy queen. (In some tales, this happens for a <em>year</em>.) At the right time, the human king kicks the bad guy's tail, then rides back to the agreed-upon meeting spot and switches back with the other king. When the sorcerer-king gets home, his wife wants to know what the deal is with the not sleeping together and all. (Exactly what she says depends on the story.) The sorcerer-king is both shocked and impressed because the queen is described as a very beautiful woman. (And usually the human king has no wife of his own to remain faithful to.)

Just as the real Acrisius enters the bedchamber, Zeus changes back with a smirk, having done the deed, turns into an eagle and flies off. Danae <em>immediately</em> gives birth, and Acrisius kills her in a fit of rage. He's about to do the same to baby Perseus, but standing on a cliff in the middle of a storm and waving your sword around like a lightning rod (while screaming insults to the gods) is not a very good idea.

Only after they're done does she realize that it was actually Captain Haffron of the alien craft. Does she feel tricked? No, she thinks it's very romantic. For his part, Haffron didn't intend to have sex with her and simply got sidetracked. In another film, Emmanuelle is the one who plays a game on Haffron by telling him that she'll use the transmuter to disguise herself as any woman on the cruise ship. He ends up sleeping with a number of women assuming they're all Emmanuelle. Only later does he find out that only one of them was. The other three women are <em>not</em> amused.

He passes out in a darkened bedroom at a party and wakes up to find Caitlin in bed with him.

<ul><li> Back in the days when you needed a good reason to be issued a divorce, a man goes into court complaining how he had been tricked into committing adultery when his wife's twin sister would sneak into his bed and have sex with him. The judge is kind of wary of this argument, saying, "You've been married for ten years and couldn't tell that it wasn't your wife when you made love?" The man said, "Yeah, I could tell. That's why I want a divorce."
</li><li> An unusual variant is the joke where a very suspicious wife, convinced that her husband is cheating on her, allows him to attend a costume party in a devil costume. She then sneaks in wearing a costume of her own, finds her devil-suited husband on the dance floor, and convinces him to take her upstairs for a quick one. She then leaves, smugly certain about his infidelity. The next morning she asks him how the party went. "Kind of boring, really," he tells her. "I played cards all night in a back room. But the guy I loaned my costume to said he had a great time!"

</li><li> In Robertson Davies's <em>The Lyre of Orpheus</em>, a man takes the place of a woman's husband in the dark.

</li><li> In the romance novel <em>Midnight Waltz</em>, the canonical couple get together because the heroine's husband won't consummate their marriage, and so his mother, wanting an heir, persuades a cousin to sneak into the bed.

It's left ambiguous as to whether or not Cherijo knew (or, at least, suspected) the truth. It helps that they did it doggy-style, so she wasn't really able to see too many details up-close to figure out that he's wearing a disguise. And no, she doesn't mind when she finds out, just like she quickly forgave him for the rape in the first book. They end up getting married.

The original Thursday can't reveal the switch without admitting that she had broken a promise by returning to Bookworld. Instead, Thursday discreetly asks Landen what he thought of the sex last nightand he answers along the lines of, "Honestly? You're usually a lot better."
</li><li> In the romance novel <em>Taken By You</em>, the hero pulls this on the conniving woman trying to break up him and his wife, by sending in his best friend to bed her (it's dark and they look very much alike). She never finds out and since his friend is as good a lover as he is, she has no complaints about "his" performance either.

<ul><li> In "Small Potatoes", a shape-shifting man impregnates several women while impersonating their husbands, impregnates his ex-girlfriend by impersonating Luke Skywalker (no, not Mark Hamil, the character from the movie), and later transforms himself into Mulder first to avoid being arrested, and then uses his appearance to try to seduce Scully. She doesn't notice (to be fair, there was wine involved) and almost kisses the non-Mulder before the real Mulder bursts in. Scully, obviously, is not amused. Notably, this is <em>treated</em> as rape (unlike many examples here) with the man registered as a sex offender and behind bars at the end of the episode.
</li><li> In "Dreamland", Mulder switches bodies with an MIB, who decides to try and seduce Scully. This time, though, she <em>does</em> notice that it's not Mulder because the MIB acts nothing like Mulder—including slapping her butt, calling her "Dana", and <em>deferring to Skinner</em>. She tricks him into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainedToABed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainedToABed">handcuffing himself to Mulder's bed</a>, and warns him if he called her "baby" again, he'd be "peeing through a catheter."

After spending the day impersonating Sam while he was out on business, Sam's girlfriend Luna shows up to consummate their relationship. To Tommy's credit, he <em>does</em> resist her at first and says they shouldn't. But as soon as she took off her top, what little resolve he had died quickly. Nonetheless, Sam is <em>furious</em> when he finds out and kicks Tommy out of his home.

</li></ul></li><li> A borderline example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Crownies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Crownies">Crownies</a></em>: a woman dresses up very provocatively for a blind date set up by a friend, with someone whose been told is an attractive dentist called Phil. Around the time she's expecting him, an average-looking campaign worker who has been going door-to-door stops by. Before he can get a word in, she asks "Are you Phil?" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy">Distracted by the Sexy</a>, he impulsively answers "Yes." She proceeds to sleep with him, even though he's nowhere near as attractive as she was led to believe Phil is, and never makes an effort to pretend to be the man she was expecting beyond lying about his name - the implication is that she never gave him a chance to talk after that. When the real Phil shows up, she reports the campaigner to the police and then to the Crown Prosecution Service. Though Richard acknowledges the man's actions could constitute rape by fraud, most of the characters are just dumbfounded by the fact that the woman slept with him for no reason beyond "He said he was Phil." Whether or not the man was charged is left unrevealed by the end of the episode.

</li><li> In one of the few male on female examples on soaps, on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SunsetBeach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SunsetBeach">Sunset Beach</a></em> a man's evil twin seduce his unaware fiancee, all the while forcing the man to watch through a two-way mirror.

</li><li> Another example on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PortCharles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PortCharles">Port Charles</a></em>, where an amnesia-stricken Lucy is seduced by her boyfriend's archenemy. The man does this knowing full well that Lucy has no idea who <em>she</em> is, much less him, and convinces her that they're lovers, all for the purpose of humiliating her and taunting her boyfriend. After her memory returns, her enraged boyfriend calls him a rapist, but it's never taken any further (pressing charges, counseling, etc)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllMyChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllMyChildren">All My Children</a></em> has an example where the (drunk) man genuinely does not realize that the woman (doped up on pain medication) doesn't know she's with someone other than her husband and feels genuinely horrible at the realization of what's happened.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Neighbours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Neighbours">Neighbours</a></em>, con-artist Andrea Somers slept with Toadie while she was impersonating his presumed-dead wife Dee (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">later revealed to be her long-lost twin sister</span>). He realised the truth shortly afterward when he found her actual passport and was horrified, albeit less by the fact that she had raped him and more by the fact that he was losing Dee all over again.
</li><li> A rather strange example goes down in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em>. In the final season, Sylar makes love with Parkman's wife when she thinks it's Matt. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's Matt's <em>body</em>, but the one in charge is Sylar.</span>
</li><li> Borderline example in the final season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>. Winn Adami takes her new spiritual guide to her bed. Later, she discovers he is actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dukat, the architect of the Bajoran occupation and genocide, in disguise.</span> Borderline since Dukat wasn't impersonating a previously existing character, but had created a completely new false identity.

An 82-year-old woman is turned into her younger self by the storm that gave the Misfits their powers. She seduces Nathan and eventually sleeps with him. He realizes this when she begins to shapeshift back into her older self while they are having sex.

Nasedo is an acknowledged villain both in-show and out, but neither the aliens nor humans he reveals this to have any reaction one way or another.

This being a comedy, Arthur is too uninterested in his wife to recall any secret only the two of them would share, but it doesn't matter in the end because they never consummated. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCuckoolanderWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCuckoolanderWasRight">At the end of the episode, Lancelot is seen asking Merlin about the trick</a>, but gives up when Merlin asks him who he wants to impersonate.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis">Book of Genesis</a> has a few examples:
<ul><li> Laban substitutes his older daughter Leah for his younger daughter Rachel when Jacob <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrideAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrideAndSwitch">thinks he's marrying the latter</a>. After quite the "battle of wills" between both men, Jacob eventually marries them both.
</li><li> Tamar, a widow of Judah's sons, was due a marriage to another man of the family under the rules of levirate marriage. When it seemed Judah was not going to go through with this Tamar disguised herself as a prostitute and met him on the road, taking his staff and sigil as payment. She conceived twins and, when Judah realized what had happened and she explained her reasons, he was shamed into admitting his mistakes and, while he didn't marry her, he did acknowledge the twins as his children and heirs.
</li></ul></li><li> According to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Talmud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Talmud">Talmud</a></em>, King David was conceived this way. His father, Jesse, was the grandson of a Moabite convert woman, and eventually became concerned that this made his marriage to a full-blooded Hebrew improper (Moabites are forbidden to marry Hebrews, though there was debate on whether or not this applied to women).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10r13');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10r13" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10r13');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It should be noted that his grandmother, Ruth, was a convert (and therefore a Jewess under the Law) at the time his father Obed was conceived. She was legally recognized as a widow entitled to the law of levirate marriage, and her second husband (and Jesse's grandfather), Boaz, made sure that all the protocols were followed before marrying her. So probably no reason for Jesse not to marry Nitzevet.</span> He decided to forgo sexual relations with his wife, Nitzevet, but, wanting more sons, took his Canaanite servant as a concubine (since Canaanites are allowed to have relationships with Hebrews <em>and</em> Midianites). Nitzevet arranged to take the servant's place and conceived David, though Jesse and his sons spent years assuming that she had had an affair.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">Arthurian legend:</a>
<ul><li> Arthur is conceived when Uther Pendragon disguises himself as Gorlois of Cornwall to sleep with Ygraine. In the movie <em>Excalibur</em>, Morgana (Morgan Le Fey) who was about 8 or so, saw through the magic that Merlin was using to help Uther rape her mother. She later calls Merlin out on it when she has him immobilized in her cave.
</li><li> Also, Elaine magically disguises herself as Guinevere in order to sleep with Lancelot. Their liaison results in the birth of the sinless, pious Galahad who achieves the Grail Quest — but in some versions, it also causes Lancelot to fall from grace.
<ul><li> This is done in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOnceAndFutureKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOnceAndFutureKing">The Once and Future King</a></em> sans magic. Twice. While the first time has the excuse that Lancelot was incredibly drunk and thus mistook Elaine for Guinevere, the second time (during which he was perfectly sober and <em>knew</em> the queen wouldn't call him to her chambers as long as Elaine was in the castle) really didn't have much besides it being dark. Guinevere sure doesn't buy it.
</li></ul></li><li> Though the original Arthurian myths usually show the incest between Arthur and one of his sisters as being a case of unknowing incest, modern re-tellings often rework it as this trope. An example would be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMistsOfAvalon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMistsOfAvalon">The Mists of Avalon</a></em> where Viviane sets up a tryst between Arthur and Morgan, knowing full well who they are in relation to each other, and when called on it, she doesn't see what they're so upset about.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a>, Zeus does this several times in his bid to bed any attractive woman he lays his eyes on (besides his very frequent use of harmless-seeming animal disguises to get close to his victims, as well as taking the shape of Artemis to rape Callisto, one of her nymphs).
<ul><li> He disguises himself as Amphitryon, sleeps with Alcmene, and begets Herakles/Hercules. The real Amphitryon apparently took this pretty well—if Zeus wants to sleep with someone, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeDivineOnMortal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeDivineOnMortal">he will,</a> but at least his wife was faithful enough that Zeus had to trick her.
</li><li> With Persephone, he disguises himself as Hades (his own older brother) and seduces her, producing Melinoe, goddess of ghosts. Pre-Orphic Hymns argue that these were not originally the stories of Melinoe and Zagreus and that they were changed to fit that particular cult.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mabinogion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mabinogion">Mabinogion</a></em>:
<ul><li> The original contains an inversion: Pwyll spends a year disguised as Arawn, so that he can kill Arawn's enemy. Arawn <em>expects</em> Pwyll to sleep with his queen, but he refuses her.
</li><li> The Evangeline Walton retelling adds a straight example to counterbalance this. Pwyll is said to be infertile as the result of the time he spent in the underworld, and "his" son Pryderi is actually Manawyddan's son, conceived while Manawyddan is disguised as Pwyll.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VolsungaSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VolsungaSaga">Völsunga saga</a></em> gives us a double-whammy: Signy disguises herself as a witch and sleeps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">her brother Sigmund</a> in order to conceive a son who is strong enough to avenge her father and brothers. The result is the fearsome Sinfjotli.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nibelungenlied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nibelungenlied">Nibelungenlied</a></em>, Siegfried pretends to be King Gunther to get into bed with Brunhild, his wife. However the twist is that Siegfried did this on Gunther's orders since Brunhild is very protective of her virginity as her superhuman strength comes from it. Gunther needed Siegfried to get into her bed and beat her half to death before he consummated his marriage with her.
</li><li> In <em>Kathasaritsagara</em>, an multi-level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryWithinAStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryWithinAStory">Story Within a Story</a> Sanskrit poem written in the 11th century by Somadeva and based on Indian myths and folk tales, Madanavega, a vidyadhara (demigod), is infatuated with Kalingasena, a human princess who wants to marry King Udayana (who is quite happy with his two wives and doesnt want anyone else). With his magical powers, Madanavega disguises himself as Udayana to sleep with her. He believes its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">different from raping her</a>, because he would never do <em>that</em>. Unlike in many examples of the trope, he does beg her forgiveness when she finds out.

The game's protagonist, CJ, pulls a kinkier-than-normal version of this as part of the heist. They need a keycard from one of the casino staff in order to pull it off, so he decides to get one by seducing a female croupier who works there, Millie. Of course, she doesn't know him yet, so his plan to remedy this is to shadow her after she leaves work and look for an opportunity. Said opportunity comes when she visits a sex shop and buys some fetish wear. By eavesdropping on her making a phone call, CJ learns that she's buying the clothes for a BDSM play session with a guy. CJ buys a gimp suit that covers his entire body and face, and then trails Millie home, where he waits for the guy to show up. When the guy arrives, CJ ambushes him and enters the house in his place, wearing the gimp suit. Millie thinks that CJ is her boyfriend and is eager to be punished by him. (This is peculiar, since gimp suits are normally worn by submissives rather than dominants, but never mind.) He obliges. Afterwards, she finds out that the guy she did all that stuff with was CJ and not her usual partner. Astonishingly, she has no problem with any of what CJ did, and becomes his regular girlfriend. She's also willing to lend him her keycard after going out for a little while, in exchange for a share of the stolen money.

Tala is the one who initiates it, and she clearly enjoys it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodPeopleHaveGoodSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodPeopleHaveGoodSex">even remarking that Lex is being a far more sensitive and attentive lover than usual</a>, but she is having sex with a stranger and enemy who has fooled her into thinking that he's really her boyfriend. Flash most likely went along with it because otherwise he might have been discovered. At the end of the episode, Lex returns to his own body, and Tala is visibly disappointed to have him back.
