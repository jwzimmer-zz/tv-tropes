Extended social isolation that makes a person go crazy. People who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robinsonade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robinsonade">stranded alone</a> will usually be subject to this. A person <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OceanMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OceanMadness">on a ship</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMadness">in space</a> where it is months or years until they reach their destination are also at risk. Solitary confinement can be a way of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoking</a> this as punishment.

</p><p>Various techniques can be employed to deal with loneliness, such as maintaining a strict daily schedule or keeping a diary.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a>'s</em> Brook spent fifty-plus years in total isolation and flashbacks suggest he definitely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OceanMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OceanMadness">went at least a little crazy in that time</a>. This might also have caused a deterioration of social skills that has resulted in Brook being one of anime's few post-mortem <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan">Dirty Old Men</a>.
<ul><li> Made worse by his Devil Fruit powers, which resurrected his soul into his undying skeleton, so in his isolation he couldn't even look forward to dying of starvation or thirst before his second lifespan finally ran out at some unknown point in the future. Due to a promise he made he couldn't kill himself, either. So he was stuck there, alone, for fifty years, with only his instruments to keep him company — and the skeletal remains of his former crew, who <em>he</em> had been in charge of when they died.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RozenMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RozenMaiden">Rozen Maiden</a></em> manga has Kirakishou <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who's been isolated in the N-Field so long she begins to go insane.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> has Yami Yugi, isolated for 3,000 years in the manga within the Puzzle, being vengeful and employing dangerous games to deal with whoever's bullying Yuugi that week. He also has seemingly no presence or sense of identity outside of this judge role until later. This may be a side effect of the manga being originally planned to be a horror story, and thus some of the early art was...interesting. This is played down in the anime.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em>: Subverted by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mariko Kurama</span>. She was immobilized in a giant containment unit soon after she was born and stayed there for 5 years, with her only contact with the outside world being a lab assistant speaking to her via an intercom. She isn't exactly a poster child for mental health, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidsAreCruel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidsAreCruel">sadistic brat</a>, but she eventually reveals herself to be far more bitter than crazy. And realistically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">she should barely be able to talk, much less function on her own</a>.
</li><li> One of the reasons why <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Yugi</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiInTokyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiInTokyo">Tenchi in Tokyo</a></em> turned to a life of villainy.
</li><li> Likely the main reason Lucia from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster">Rave Master</a></em> is so screwed up. In general, locking a small child up in a <em>maximum security prison</em> and depriving them of contact with the rest of the world for ten years is bad for one's mental health.
</li><li> After an untold amount of time floating alone in space, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Cars, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the second arc</span> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>, is said to go so mad that his mind just <em>shuts off</em>.
<ul><li> The main villan, DIO, spends ONE-HUNDRED YEARS in a coffin before his return in Part 3. It's implied that didn't help his (already questionable) state of mind.
</li><li> The same thing happens to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Magenta Magenta</span> in Part 7, minus the space part.
</li><li> Same for Part 5 villain <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Diavolo</span>, who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is bound to an eternal cycle of suffering as each time he dies, his death is reseted by Gold Experience Requiem's power.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Almost happens to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Cyborg009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Cyborg009">Cyborg 009</a></em> in an episode of the 2001 series, when he spends a whole episode stuck in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> mode. What feels as mere seconds for the others, is for him <em>several days</em> spent unable to interact with anyone since he moves so fast that no one can see/hear/etc. him, and he can't touch them either as the smallest touch could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">set anything ablaze</a>. It truly is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">And I Must Scream</a> situation, and he almost crosses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a>.
</li><li> Averted with the old man in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SuicideIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SuicideIsland">Suicide Island</a></em>. He's far more concerned with survival than contact with others — going so far as to actively avoid contact with anyone — but his mental health is possibly the best on the entire island.
</li><li> Happens briefly to Hachimaki in episode 16 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Planetes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Planetes">Planetes</a></em>. After he's inadvertently isolated for a brief time in space, he develops Acute Spatial Disorder and has problems doing his job in space. He's treated by being put inside a sensory deprivation room. Once it goes dark inside, his mind starts to play tricks on him, and he's forced to overcome the problem.
</li><li> Comedic example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YugamiKunNiWaTomodachiGaInai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YugamiKunNiWaTomodachiGaInai">Yugami-kun ni wa Tomodachi ga Inai</a>:</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewTransferStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewTransferStudent">New Transfer Student</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends">Chihiro</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl">Watanuki</a> thinks being isolated by classmates and having no one to talk to at school could cause not just her, but <em>anybody</em> psychological damage. Not the case with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">Yuuji</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonersAreFreaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonersAreFreaks">Yugami</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveMeAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveMeAlone">loner</a> who sits beside her and averts this; despite being ignored by everyone in class, he's completely fine with it and has an optimistic, confident personality to boot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em>: Monev the Gale, first of the Gung-Ho Guns was raised from childhood in near total isolation, forced to do nothing except physical training and target shooting. His attack on Vash is his first real experience with the outside world, and it shows, from his utter and complete disregard for human life or collateral damage in the ensuing battle (in the anime, he seems to completely <em>ignore</em> the presence of anyone except Vash), to his blubbering breakdown when Vash finally overpowers him.
</li><li> One of the major themes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WelcomeToTheNHK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WelcomeToTheNHK">Welcome to the N.H.K.</a></em> is showing the mental issues and unhealthy behaviors Satou has picked up from becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hikikomori" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hikikomori">Hikikomori</a>, and Misaki's attempts to break him out of them. At one point in the story, Satou imagines himself in his fifties as the most extreme example of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasementDweller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasementDweller">Basement-Dweller</a>, and it's <em>scary</em>. While it's fun to joke about being this type of person, progressing to the height of this disorderly life and having an empty existence is a dark and sad future. Thankfully, Satou never reaches that point.
</li><li> A very disturbing example occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> with Mavis Vermillion after she casts an imperfect version of Fairy Law. She apparently angered the deity Ankhselam and received a curse that causes her to take life the more she cares about it. After accidentally stealing the life from Yuri Dreyar's wife, Mavis immediately flees from her guild and keeps herself secluded from society. This causes her to become very disturbed and dishevelled, and she only knows release when she encounters Zeref, who also has the curse and can comfort her and reveals he is in love with her.

NASA uses it for training astronauts to deal with the extreme quiet of space. The effects come on <em>extremely fast</em>, with people starting to have auditory hallucinations and asking to be let out in less than <em>forty-five minutes.</em>
<ul><li> However, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA">Veritasium<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, in his video: <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXVGIb3bzHI">Can Silence Actually Drive You Crazy?<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, stayed inside an anechoic chamber for a whole hour comfortably...
</li></ul></li><li> Felicity Aston, first woman to make a solo trek across Antarctica, took almost sixty days. She was not entirely out of contact with the world - she used Twitter the whole way - and "mad" is very much overstating it, but she didn't see anyone else for the whole time. Ashton wrote about Having to remind myself of the rules now Im not alone; no peeing wherever I stand, no talking to the sun, no snot or dribble on my face and was <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/9iYVKQDJak4">clearly affected<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> when she finished.
<ul><li> This is actually a nearly-universal problem for arctic and antarctic explorers, even when traveling in groups. The harsh conditions, constant danger, and exhausting labor make it very hard to keep up ordinary social conventions, and even close friends can turn on each other.
<ul><li> Astronauts qualify too. NASA understands, at least, that humans have social as well as physiological needs, and requires that astronauts on the ISS have at least one communal meal a day, which has the added bonus of keeping morale high.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> When highly social animals are kept alone in captivity, this can result. Most zoo accreditation organizations require that their members do not house such animals alone.
<ul><li> Most famously (and disturbingly) demonstrated by Harry Harlow's experiments on rhesus monkeys, beginning in the 1950s and continuing into the <em>1970s</em>. Harlow experimented with isolating monkeys from their mothers and peers - sometimes leaving them able to observe from afar, other times leaving them inside a completely dark, featureless metal container he dubbed "The Pit of Despair" in 1970. The experiments showed that after a few months of isolation, the monkeys were socially stunted and unable to properly function, even going so far as to harm themselves, kill their babies, or refuse to eat to the point of fatal malnutrition. Worth noting that Harlow's experiments (and his "colourful" depictions of them - the Pit of Despair was par for the course in terms of his naming conventions) were considered so disturbing, they helped kick-start the animal liberation movement and resulted in many new ethical regulations for the treatment of lab animals.
</li><li> German biologist Rudolph Schenkel formulated the first theory on hierarchy in wolf packs in 1947, describing certain wolves as "leader wolves", wolves who held the leadership in the pack. American biologist L. David Mech, would in 1970 build upon Schenkel's theories, describing certain wolves as "alpha males" who used their strength to intimidate the lower-ranking "beta males" into submission, and using this power to secure themselves the most food and best mate. There was a rather glaring problem with these studies, however; namely that they were conducted on wolves in captivity. Mech would later extensively study wild wolves in their natural habitat, and he came to discover that his findings from 1970 pretty much never occurred in nature; the wild wolves were on the whole much, much more cooperative and egalitarian in their behavior, only having a very loosely defined hierarchy at best. Mech eventually concluded that only wolves in captivity conform to the alpha-beta dynamic, presumably because of the stress they experience from the lack of free movement and being confined to a small space, and has since denounced the idea of "alpha wolves" as an outdated and disproven theory.
</li><li> As mentioned above, keeping rats (or other colony pets) in pairs or groups tends is most advised as they do better that way because they get mean or despondent, trying to socialize with any/everything if they can, if they aren't. However, there's some exceptions to this.
</li></ul></li><li> The original example of solitary confinement was instituted by the Quakers in the 1790s. The idea was that the criminal thus confined would have only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> and his own thoughts to keep him company, and thus the penitent would emerge from confinement born again and fully-reformed (thus the term "penitentiary", which they also created). In actual fact, such prisoners frequently killed or mutilated themselves, or became so violently paranoid that they were never able to rejoin society. It's a sad irony the Quakers meant this to be a <em>humane</em> treatment of prisoners...
<ul><li> Solitary confinement for extended periods of time is now recognized as a form of torture. US Senator John McCain, former POW held in North Vietnam, stated the physical torture caused far less suffering than the prolonged solitary confinement, breaking their spirits like nothing else could.

</li><li> A particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">sad example</a>: babies who are not touched and are left by themselves but are still given enough food and water to survive often suffer from <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_to_thrive">Failure to thrive<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which can have effects ranging from stunting growth to outright death.
<ul><li> In a similar vein, if no one comes when a baby cries, they don't cry anymore and they might not take being held, either.
</li></ul></li><li> The U.S Federal Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Security Prison Florence Colorado (informally known as ADX Florence). A supermax prison where all inmates are held in solitary confinement in small, sparse cells containing just a concrete bed (with a thin mattress), sink, toilet, shower, black-and-white television, small radio, and concrete desk. It holds mostly foreign and domestic terrorists; they're held in their cells for all but an hour a day and have little to no contact with the other inmates (the cells also have double doors for extra isolation and are concrete to prevent coded communication). Referred to by a former Warden as a "Clean version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell">Hell</a>". Many of the inmates have suffered various mental illnesses and have been known to spend their days wailing, just to try and find relief from the crushing, ever-present silence. There was even a class action lawsuit filed claiming that the prison didn't adequately diagnose or treat the inmates who were suffering duress due to the long periods of isolation, and a wing where prisoners never leave their cells, period.
</li><li> Even when the isolation isn't extremely harsh this can happen. When the underboss of the Philadelphia/Atlantic City mob Philip "Crazy Phil" Leonetti turned informant he was placed in a special cell at La Tuna Prison in Texas that's nicknamed the Vallachi Suite (named after mob informant Joe Vallachi). Though living in a relatively comfortable surroundings (including a large living room with a big television, stereo and exercise bike, a good size bathroom and kitchen) he was isolated from the other inmates at the prison and only had contact with the guards and investigators. After 2 years he started to go stir crazy from being isolated and requested a transfer.
</li><li> When filming <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbitAnUnexpectedJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbitAnUnexpectedJourney">The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey</a></em>, Sir <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanMcKellen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanMcKellen">Ian McKellen</a> found it surprisingly difficult to play group scenes entirely alone in a green screen room, with only an earpiece and pictures of the other actors mounted on poles to react to. Because of scale issues his co-stars playing the dwarves and Hobbit were playing the rest of the scene on a neighboring set, and he would be composited into their scene later. McKellen broke down into tears because of his loneliness and isolation, saying this wasn't why he became an actor. Luckily for McKellen, the crew listened to him and gave him a "Gandalf Appreciation Day", and he was able to regain his footing and continue filming.
</li><li> William F. Buckley (not the founder of <em>National Review</em> magazine) was a CIA station chief in Lebanon. In 1984, he was kidnapped by Hezbollah. The CIA later discovered that between drug-induced interrogations, he was kept blindfolded, handcuffed, and shackled in a cell the size of a coffin <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">for 15 months</a></em> until he died of a heart attack. A video of Buckley was sent to the CIA and he was described as such: "Buckley was close to a gibbering wretch. His words were often incoherent; he slobbered and drooled and, most unnerving of all, he would suddenly scream in terror, his eyes rolling helplessly and his body shaking".
<ul><li> And this is from someone <em>specifically trained</em> in how to survive torture and isolation.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/COVID19Pandemic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/COVID19Pandemic">COVID-19 Pandemic</a> led to many governments around the world to mandate lockdowns, with citizens not allowed to congregate or leave the house unless necessary. While the mental health blow was slightly lessened thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">modern technology allowing for greater virtual connectivity than before</a>, the impact has still been shown to be incredibly devastating, with reports of crisis centers receiving massive spikes in calls following the lockdown orders. Even people that were more or less well adjusted have experienced more stress and irritableness from not being able to socialize with others in person.
