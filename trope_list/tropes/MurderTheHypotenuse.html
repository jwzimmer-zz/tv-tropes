</p><p>It can get particularly twisted when some sides of the triangle are completely one-sided. Bob is in love with Alice, but Alice not only fails to realize it but is already in a relationship with Chris. This is a classic recipe for drama (or humor) but sometimes, it goes too far.

</p><p>Not always the best thought-out plan, no. Sometimes, Bob may not even consider what would happen if Alice ever found out. In fact, in a lot of these situations, Bob doesn't even make any effort to hide his actions from her and seems to be convinced that she'll somehow fall in love with him as soon as he kills Chris.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaHime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaHime">Kaguya Hime</a></em>: Mayu lets her mother die in front of her eyes for making both Akira model nude for her and coercing Akira into a same-sex relationship with her. She also threatens to kill anyone Akira gets involved with.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary">Future Diary</a></em>:
<ul><li> It's shown very clearly that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yuno Gasai</a> (pictured above) would be all too willing to kill ANYONE who got in the way of her "love" with Yukiteru (including his mother and father). In fact, Yuno is even willing to kill anyone who is less than ten feet away from Yukiteru simply because they are less than ten feet away from him. Heck, she's even willing to kill Yukiteru AND HERSELF just to be with Yukiteru. Essentially, if she doesn't kill him the world will end and they will both die. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> If she does kill him then she can go to a different world's timeline, kill that timeline's version of herself, and then be with that timeline's Yukiteru. She doesn't seem to really mind that each of the world's Yukiteru are technically different people since her "love" for him is just to satisfy herself, at least until the end of the story, and she herself admits this.</span>
</li><li> A less lethal version of this seems to be executed by Aru Akise, who has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">crush</a> on Yukiteru. He <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> goes through the trouble of researching everything about Yuno's background to try to dig up dirt on her, and exposes it to Yukiteru, telling Yukiteru to "get away from her."</span> Chapter 50 seems to have confirmed this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When Yuno shows up, Akise glares at her, declares "I won't hand over Yukiteru to you!", and forcefully kisses Yukiteru. This sends Yuno into a rage and she comes at Akise with a knife. Akise tries to kill Yuno, because he believes she's trying to kill Yukiteru, and destroy her diary but ends up failing, because it turns out Yuno had two diaries, and she ends up stabbing him</span>. In the following chapter <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> despite having just been stabbed by Yuno and sliced across the throat, Akise gets back up out of sheer determination (and love for Yukiteru) and texts an important message to Yukiteru even though Yuno ends up cutting off his head completely</span>. He also nearly kills Yuno earlier in the manga with the two grappling for each others diary phones and Akise trying to strangle Yuno.

</li><li> Also invoked by Al and Ann from the Makaiju <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FillerArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FillerArc">Filler Arc</a>, especially in the end when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Al orders the tree to kill Mamoru so he can have Usagi, then Ann retorts by ordering it to kill Usagi so she can have Mamoru.

They make a habit out of harassing/threatening her, once deliberately made sure she got separated from Kairi and was stranded during a class trip, <em>push her into the path of a campfire when she was holding cooking oil</em>, and, at one point, held her down, and told her that she has to sign a contract swearing that she'll stay away from Kairi or they'll burn all her hair off (while holding a lighter to her hair), and try to beat her up later on when she states that their selfish and cruel actions won't make Kairi fall in love with them, and when she tells them that her love for Kairi is genuine. In addition, they take the threat even further with "We'll burn your face so badly that Kairi won't ever look at you again," and "Don't worry, we'll push you into the pool before your whole body catches fire."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PeacemakerKurogane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PeacemakerKurogane">Peacemaker Kurogane</a></em>: In the manga, Suzu comes to this conclusion when Ryoma decides to take Tetsunosuke away from him. Some fans also theorize this is what Suzu has in mind when he pays Saya, Tetsunosuke's love interest, a surprise visit, given his obsession with Tetsu.
<ul><li> Yoshida, Suzu's master, also qualifies as it's implied he was jealous of Suzu's close friendship with Tetsu and many times tried to have Tetsu killed because he had feelings for his charge Suzu. He did this by trying to manipulate Suzu into doing so and then trying to do so himself out of frustration when that failed. He refused to give up in this endeavor even after having his arm cut off and held a sword in his mouth to Tetsu's throat. Only him suddenly being decapitated by Okita stopped him.

<ul><li> Tatewaki Kuno: Has never actually tried to kill Ranma for Akane or "the pigtailed girl's" hand, and doesn't even seem to want to kill Ranma in their fights. His attitude of "if I beat up Ranma, then the girls I want will naturally flock to me for proving my studliness" does fit under the general umbrella of this trope, but lethal force is not his intention. Though... there is the way he starts swinging around a live steel katana instead of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenKatanasAreEvenBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenKatanasAreEvenBetter">bokken</a> during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tanabata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tanabata">Tanabata</a> and Failed Wedding stories, which probably inspired his fanon reputation.
</li><li> Kodachi Kuno: Joined in with Ukyo and Shampoo in attacking Nabiki during the "Nabiki, Ranma's New Fiancee" manga arc, in hopes of killing her and taking him for herself. Similarly, teamed up with them to beat up Miss Hinako during the manga arc she was introduced in, as she suspected the teacher was trying to seduce Ranma. She did show at the Failed Wedding in a wedding gown of her own and planning to marry Ranma herself, but wasn't slinging bombs around like Ukyo and Shampoo.
</li><li> Ukyo Kuonji: Generally prefers more "nonviolent" approaches to trying to win Ranma, such as setting Akane up on a date with Ryoga, trying to lure Ranma &amp; Akane into a magical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kimodameshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kimodameshi">Kimodameshi</a> that will supposedly break them up irrevocably, or agreeing to let Ranma stay at her home after he is kicked out (and, later, to let him use her business as a wager on the condition he will join her in resuming her travels if he loses it) in hopes that this will make him "realise how perfect she is for him". However, she <em>can</em> go about it violently as well; she willingly joins in with Shampoo and Kodachi when they attack Nabiki with plans to kill her and then fight over who gets Ranma, and is the one who suggests Hinako might be trying to seduce Ranma and leads the other two girls in ambushes on her. She shows up at the Failed Wedding throwing bombs, though possibly at Ranma rather than Akane, and wonders why she didn't think of it herself when Kodachi reveals her plan to use this ceremony as a way to marry Ranma at last. In the anime, though the aforementioned attacks on Nabiki and Hinako are removed, Ukyo plots to herself about killing Akane when she asks for her help in the second of the "One to Carry On" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OAV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OAV">OAVs</a> and begins throwing random heavy objects at her, growing angry when Shampoo throws something at her and leaving a clear impression she thought that she and Shampoo would work together to kill Akane, and then finish fighting each other.
</li><li> Shampoo: Given she stated "obstacles are for killing" when Ranma tried to prevent her attacking Akane for Ranma's hand in her first story, it's understandable that she gets hit with this trope the most — in canon and in fanon. Fanon usually overstates her actually <em>trying</em> to kill her rivals, though. Canonically, while the idea doesn't seem to bother her in the slightest, it isn't something she tries all of the time. Notably, when she first thought Akane was an obstacle to pursuing Ranma's hand, she actually just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">wiped her memories of Ranma</a>. Then, when it looked like Akane might be breaking through the memory block, she tried to strengthen the block, only attacking after Akane did break through the block and kept interfering — and even then, she stopped attacking Akane the moment Ranma told her not to. After that, though, she tried to give Akane a Jusenkyo Duck curse in order to "pawn" Mousse off on her, plotted to murder Akane and pin the blame on Taro in the first Pantyhose Taro story, was the first to suggest attacking Nabiki during her stint as Ranma's fiancee in the manga, joined in Ukyo's plot to beat up Hinako in the manga, came up with the same plan as Ukyo in "The One To Carry On, Part 2" and wrecked the plan by attacking Ukyo first instead of Akane... the final manga story arcs, Jusendo and the Failed Wedding, had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed">Brainwashed</a> Shampoo (who, given she was obediently sent to murder Ranma, even if she did muster some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower">Villainous Willpower</a> to try and wriggle out of obeying, was arguably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a>) threaten to pop off the dollified Akane's head and a normal Shampoo attacked Akane &amp; Ranma with bombs at the wedding ceremony.
</li><li> Mousse: Introduced to the series specifically challenging Ranma for the right to Shampoo's hand, threatening to take Akane if Ranma couldn't beat him. On his return, attempted to murder Ranma by using him/her as the target in a knife-throwing act (Ranma managed to catch the knives in her teeth) and then chased him around the circus throwing daggers and water balloons full of Jusenkyo Duck water at him. Shortly after that, he kidnapped Akane and threatened to douse her with said Jusenkyo water, in reality planning to either murder or curse (whichever came first) Ranma when he raced to Akane's rescue. He then challenged Ranma to yet another duel to win a date with Shampoo. Repeatedly throughout the series, Mousse challenges Ranma to fights because, like Kuno, he thinks that beating Ranma will make Shampoo fall in love with him — unlike Kuno, Mousse doesn't seem bothered by the idea of killing Ranma if that's what it takes to win, though he has never actually "won" except in fights where he had other things on his mind and so passed over the opportunity to deliver the coup de grace.

<ul><li> Naoko Akagi was sexually involved with Gendo Ikari after the death of his wife Yui Ikari, though it is suggested that Naoko wanted Gendo before, as she described Yuis disappearance as being exactly what shed hoped for. Naoko still strangled the first Rei Ayanami when the child said that Gendo considered Naoko as an "old hag" and no longer useful (Reis resemblance to Yui might also have been a factor, as Yuis face appears superimposed over Rei 1s as she speaks to Naoko). She was later horrified that she had done so and committed suicide.
</li><li> Also, Ritsuko Akagi was romantically involved with Gendo, as her mother Naoko was before her. However, she eventually realizes that Gendo is using her in the same way that he used her mother, and that he cares about Rei more than her, so she likens Rei to that of a romantic rival. In the manga her disdain of Rei is more evident: at one point, during one of Rei's medical checkups, Ritsuko loses control after Rei rebukes her and tries to strangle Rei to death. Realizing that she was acting like her mother before her, she stops herself from killing Rei, but warns Rei against telling anyone what happened. She also destroys the Rei clones in a bid to get at Rei and Gendou.

Rhaenyra was already paranoid about the dragonseeds since two of them had already betrayed her. This pushed her over the edge and she demanded that Lord Manfryd Mooton, Nettles' and Daemons' host at the time, execute Nettles and deliver her head to Rhaenyra. Fortunately for Nettles, Lord Mooton ignored the order, not wanting to violate Guest Right. His maester then warned Daemon and Nettles of Rhaenyra's order — Nettles would then flee with her dragon, abandoning the Dance of Dragons entirely, while Daemon would go on to die fighting Aemond Tagaryen. Rhaenyra's jealousy and paranoia ultimately cost her two dragonriders along with their dragons and her most capable commander, paving the way for her eventual downfall. Even worse, it's not confirmed whether or not Daemon and Nettles were even having an affair in the first place — other records from that time strongly imply that Daemon saw Nettles as a surrogate daughter.

<ul><li> In the episode "Metamorphosis", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">squicky</a> example occurs when an extremely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverProtectiveDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverProtectiveDad">Over Protective Dad</a> (who loved his daughter maybe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest">a bit too much</a>) didn't like his daughter's fiancee so he tried to kill him. When that failed, he pretended that the one who told him to do it was the fiancee's old friend Green Lantern, while showing him a photo of Green Lantern and his fiancee embracing. The fiancee then invoked this trope himself as he went after Green Lantern in a rage.
</li><li> In "Starcrossed", Hro Talak insists on fighting Green Lantern / John Stewart <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveHimToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveHimToMe">one-on-one</a> so he can personally kill the man he views as having "taken" Shayera Hol (Hawkgirl) from him. In reality, Shayera dumping him had more to do with Talak's willingness to commit war crimes against Earth.
</li><li> Subverted in "Hunter's Moon": Shayera and Mari (Vixen) are caught in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> with John.

When Vixen is captured she immediately strikes a deal with the Thanagarians — spare her and she will deliver Hawkgirl to them. She even goes so far as to cite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> as the reason she will betray her superior so quickly. However, she does not go through with it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector">nor did she ever plan to</a>; once the Thanagarians let their guard down and bring her to their aircraft she hijacks the ship so she can get herself <em>and</em> Hawkgirl out of there safely. Later episodes play the trope for laughs as Shayera and Mari <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">begin to become close friends</a>, as Shayera comments that she is trying to learn proper Earth protocol for these situations and thusly can not just poison Mari's water like she would on Thanagar.
</li><li> The relationship eventually evolves into a quadrilateral by introducing Carter "Hawkman" Hall as a rival for Shayera's affection and the story wastes no time in getting to hypotenuse murdering: in Hawkman's second appearance, a physical manifestation of his dark side kidnaps John Stewart and orders Hawkman to kill him. Hawkman, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">being a hero</a>, does not comply.

In truth, the dog had spent the rest of its life waiting in vain for Fry to come home. This ending was so depressing that it was retconned in <em>Bender's Big Score</em>.
</li><li> In <em>Bender's Big Score</em> Zapp Brannigan is all too keen on sending Leela's boyfriend Lars on a suicide mission to get him out of the way. Then again, Zapp is ALWAYS sending every single one of his crew members on suicide missions, so this is business as usual even if you discount his interest in banging a freshly grieving Leela.
</li></ul></li><li> Wendy, Stan's love interest/girlfriend in the early seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>, went so far as to have a substitute teacher arrested on false charges and locked inside a rocket that's launched directly at the sun, for the crime of having been the object of a brief crush from Stan. Don't get on <em>her</em> bad side! (The thing is, the teacher was a <em>lesbian</em> and Wendy didn't know that, so there's also a dose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">Poor Communication Kills</a> involved.)
<ul><li> What makes it either better or worse (depending on how you feel of said twist) was that the episode originally intended to have Ms. Ellen <em>actually</em> be a spy and be sent to the sun for her crimes. Parker and Stone tacked on the ending with Wendy paying off the Iraqis, as they felt the original ending was too much of a downer and that it'd be funnier if Wendy conspired to kill her.
</li><li> Happens in another episode when Satan gets caught in a love triangle between his old boyfriend, Saddam Hussein, and his new boyfriend, Chris. Satan can't decide who he wants to stay with when Saddam decides for him and kills Chris. It's ultimately subverted. Since they were all already in Hell, Chris only comes back. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Where was he gonna go? Detroit?</a>

She's very effective, but Jimmy falls in love with it. As you might expect, the robot didn't last the episode.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt">Sadira</a>, from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AladdinTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AladdinTheSeries">Aladdin: The Series</a></em>, subverts this; she wanted Jasmine out of the way,<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> before she eventually got over Aladdin,</span> but did not want her dead or seriously hurt, even explaining it in detail to a grunt.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em> in the episode "Suddenly Suzy", where we find out Candace is very aware of this trope and hides anything she thinks could be used to kill her before Suzy arrives. Suzy herself isn't a <em>romantic</em> rival but certainly sees Candace as a rival for her older brother Jeremy's attention.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GeneratorRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GeneratorRex">Generator Rex</a></em> features that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">Creepy Child</a> minion of Breach's. She's never named, but she's absolutely obsessed with making Breach happy and tries to kill Rex when she realizes Breach likes Rex more.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KidVsKat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KidVsKat">Kid vs. Kat</a></em> featured Coop going on a hike with a group of his friends, including his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedLoveInterest">Implied Love Interest</a> Fiona and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> Phoebe. Being a rather terrifying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a>, Phoebe spends the entire hike trying to get rid of Fiona, even locking her in an abandoned cabin and then leading the others further along the trail so that they wouldn't hear her calling for help.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the episode "Arnold Visits Arnie", at the end of Arnold's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareSequence">Nightmare Sequence</a>, Arnie goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> when he thinks Arnold is stealing his girl and tries to attack him.

Berry is initially sweet and polite, but once she develops a crush on Bloo, she turns into a psychotic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> who continually tries to get rid of Bloo's best friend Mac so that she can have Bloo to herself. Worst of all, Bloo barely even notices her and constantly forgets her name.

<ul><li> Cesare and Lucrezia Borgia were widely rumored to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">have been lovers</a> in an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidTheyOrDidntThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidTheyOrDidntThey">Did They or Didn't They?</a> of epic proportions. Cesare was believed to be extremely jealous of Lucrezia's second husband, Alfonso of Aragon, both for Alfonso's good looks (Cesare's face had been scarred by syphilis) and because Lucrezia seemed genuinely happy with her husband. Cesare had Alfonso attacked by his men in the middle of the night, but Alfonso survived. His men retaliated by shooting arrows at Cesare one day while he was in his garden. Cesare shortly thereafter had Alfonso strangled in his recovery room. Lucrezia was said to be devastated. It should be noted that Lucrezia and Alfonso's marriage was quickly becoming a useless alliance, which also probably had something to do with Cesare's motives.
</li><li> According to some sources, Peter the Great infamously had the man he thought was his wife, Catherine I's, lover beheaded. He was rumored to have had the head preserved in a jar of alcohol which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">he forced Catherine to keep in her bedroom until his death</a>.
</li><li> Isabella of France and her lover Roger Mortimer led an invasion against Isabella's incompetent husband, Edward II of England, who was eventually forced to abdicate in favor of his and Isabella's son. During their coup, she made sure that Edward's favorite and rumored lover Hugh Despenser was brutally executed as payback for trying to drive a wedge between husband and wife. And when Edward died in the Tower of London, Isabella and Mortimer were thought to be responsible. Once Isabella's son came of age and became King Edward III, he had Mortimer executed on fourteen counts of treason, including the murder of Edward's father. It's not proven whether they actually murdered Edward or not; some scholars hold that Edward's death was not murder at all.
</li><li> Henry Stuart aka Lord Darnley, the cousin and consort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaryOfScotland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaryOfScotland">Mary of Scotland</a>, thought that his wife was just <em>too</em> close to her secretary, David Rizzio. So he and other nobles interrupted a reunion between them and stabbed Rizzio <em>56 times</em> in front of the pregnant Queen, despite her pleas and a failed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoThroughMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoThroughMe">Go Through Me</a>.
</li><li> Rachel Wade, an American woman and former Applebee's waitress currently incarcerated in a Florida female correction center, was arrested and charged with killing a woman who dated her ex-boyfriend Joshua Camacho. Rachel's victim was Sarah Ludemann. Sarah began dating Camacho shortly after Rachel broke up with him. Sarah even sometimes showed up at the Applebee's Rachel worked at to taunt her. Rachel violently made many attempts to separate them including punching Sarah in the face. Rachel broke into Camacho's house and stabbed Sarah in the heart with a steak knife, leading to Rachel being charged with second-degree murder and a $500,000 bond before being sentenced to 27 years in prison.
