<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Belgariad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Belgariad">Belgariad</a></em> series, Sendaria chose its first king like this, and <em>everyone</em> could vote. Also, the winning candidate had to have a <em>majority</em> of the votes rather than simply the <em>most</em> votes. It took six years and twenty-two ballots to winnow the 724 candidates down to a single winner, a rutabaga farmer named Fundor. As a result, nobody takes the monarchy all that seriously—not even the monarch. Also, the Empire of Tolnedra elects a new Emperor if the old one dies without an heir.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em>:
<ul><li> The royalty of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros is normally hereditary, but a hundred years before the series takes place, the Blackfyre Rebellion occurred because the king legitimized his bastard sons on his deathbed and in so doing created a <em>massive</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a> (there were rumors that the trueborn brother, who was also the eldest, was actually the king's brother's son, and the eldest bastard, Daemon Blackfyre, believing them, rose up against him). Several years and a few thousand bodies later, the only Targaryen heirs left were either children or mentally unstable. A Great Council was formed from many of the ruling lords to choose the next king. They passed through many candidates in the Targaryen family tree before settling on Aegon V, a fourth son of a fourth son, hereafter known as Aegon "The Unlikely". After choosing the next king, the Great Council dissolved and the crown passed on through the family, though in the prelude to the War of the Five Kings, the possibility of another Great Council being formed is brought up due to the disputed heritage and validity of nearly all the contenders' claims to the throne.
</li><li> The First Great Council was called by Jaehaerys I after the deaths of his two eldest sons to decide who would be his heir. The lords, with a vast majority, voted for the male-line candidate, Jaehaerys' 24-year old grandson Viserys, rather than a female or the female-line candidate, Jaehaerys 7-year old great-grandson Laenor Velaryon. This apparently codified that Targaryen rule had to happen through the male line.
</li><li> The Ironborn thousands of years ago elected their kings through a kingsmoot, which could sometimes go on for days and would occasionally be used to depose unworthy kings. This practice ended when Urron "Redhand" Greyiron, the great-nephew of the previous king, murdered many of his opponents at the kingsmoot, beginning hereditary rule. After House Greyiron ended, the Ironborn chose House Hoare, and when House Hoare was destroyed almost three centuries before the series starts, Aegon the Conqueror allowed the Iron Islands to choose their new ruler, and they chose the Greyjoys. Ironborn ostensibly follow the same agnatic-cognatic primogeniture as five of the other six kingdoms, but in practice, there is enough resistance when a woman is next in line to inherit that they revive their centuries-dead tradition of a kingsmoot instead. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The crown winds up going to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Euron Greyjoy</a>, the man who <em>would</em> have been heir in an agnatic (male-only) primogeniture system. Ironically the kingsmoot was called by his youngest brother Aeron partially to prevent Euron becoming king of the Isles, who hoped his other brother Victarian Greyjoy would be chosen instead. No word yet on if they'll codify this or stick with an elective monarchy.</span>
</li><li> The Wildlings occasionally elect a "king beyond the wall", which is simply a title given to whichever one of them manages to unite sufficiently many wildlings to follow his leadership. Mance Rayder is king beyond the wall during the events of the book, and holds it entirely on merit.
</li><li> The Prince of Pentos is chosen by the magisters. He has a mostly ceremonial role, charged with justice, trade and war, while the magisters largely run the city. If he fails in his duties, he's sacrificed to appease the gods and another prince is selected. The candidates are selected from the "forty families" and seem to have no say in the manner. One of them liked the idea of being chosen so little he fled the city and is known as the Tattered Prince (he now heads a company of mercenaries).
</li><li> The Sealord of Braavos is also elected, though it's unclear if it's this or a republic. However considering Braavos is based on Italian Renaissance city-states (especially Venice) it is likely the latter.
</li><li> Lorath has <em>three</em> princes, each of them elected by a different group — the Harvest Prince is elected by vote amongst all landowners, the Fisher Prince by all shipowners, and the Prince of the Streets by all free men. All three offices serve for life, but have long since been reduced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing">Puppet Kings</a> of the city's magisters.
</li><li> The Archon of Tyrosh, like the Prince of Pentos, is chosen by the council of magisters, in this case from among their own number. How much actual authority he really has is unknown.

The Ironborn are the <em>only</em> one of the Seven Kingdoms that, back when they were independent, chose their own rulers through a form of limited democracy. The wildlings also elect their king, however he only holds power so long as the wildlings choose to follow him, and there are always holdouts like Craster. There is no sign yet of whether Pentos elects a prince too. In regards to the Ironborn, all of the lords and ship captains gather together at an assembly known as a "kingsmoot", where anyone can present themself as a candidate, not just the previous king's family. Candidates give stump speeches, and whoever wins over the crowd to get the most votes becomes the new king. They revive this after declaring independence again during the War of the Five Kings (though according to the "Histories and Lore" extras of Season 6, in the intervening period when their ruler was just a "lord paramount" under the Targaryens and Baratheons, the kingsmoot still existed but only as a formality, always "choosing" the eldest Greyjoy heir). The only other group in Westeros that has formal elections like this is the Night's Watch. The Watch is even more democratic, with literally <em>every</em> member getting to cast a vote  though that isn't really a fair comparison, given that while the Watch does control territory and castles they're not really a "kingdom" but a monastic knightly order.

<ul><li> The Empire elects their emperors in essentially the same way as the Holy Roman Empire, with the provincial nobles and the high priests selecting one of their number. This system was put in place after the first emperor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">died and was deified</a> without designating an heir. That said, it is a rare occurrence indeed that the Elector of Reikland does not win the election. The Elector of Reikland and the Grand Theogonist and Arch-Lectors of the cult of Sigmar always vote for Reikland, The Ar-Ulric and Elector of Middenheim always vote for Middenheim and the Elder of the Moot always votes for the eldest son of the incumbent (unless said son <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp">wears his pants on his head</a>), meaning that the Elector of Reikland more often than not has five of fifteen votes by default, the Elector of Middenheim has two, and eight are up for grabs.
</li><li> The High Elves have a similar arrangement for the position of Phoenix King, who is elected by the great Princes of Ulthuan. That said, the King's consort, the Everqueen is a hereditary monarch, falling to the daughter of the previous Everqueen and the King. Their system is probably the setting's most stable, as their past with power struggles mean the elves have a series of both spoken and unspoken rules about the process, and lines they know never to cross. For example, Caledor II, son of Caledor the Conqueror, left the elves with such a distaste for nepotistic Phoenix Kings that they have <em>never</em> appointed the son of the previous king since then.
</li><li> The dukes of Bretonnia elect a king from amongst themselves (with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChooserOfTheOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChooserOfTheOne">Grail Enchantress</a> having the final word) whenever an old king dies. This is because the king of Bretonnia <em>must</em> be a Grail Knight (a duke, meanwhile, must only be a knight). However, if the king's hereditary heir already <em>is</em> a Grail Knight he's all but certain to be the next king.
</li><li> The Dwarfs do something a bit different. Each individual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateUndergroundBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateUndergroundBase">Hold</a>has a hereditary monarchy, passed down the royal line of the ruling clan. The position of High King, however, is available to all royalty. Instead of merely voting on a successor, though, they compete for it. When a Council of Kings is called, powerful Thanes and the entire royal families of every clan convene in the capital of Karaz-a-Karak. The candidates have one year to perform heroic feets and great deeds, and a Council of Elders chooses the High King based on who they believe accomplished the most.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller">Traveller</a></em> one of the two main <em>official</em> powers the Imperial Moot (all the nobles in the Imperium who have the time to show up) is to veto or confirm the Emperor's choice of succession. The other is to dissolve the Imperium. The second power was given as a "mutual assured destruction" should one noble house become too overbearing. The first makes the Third Imperium a sort of hereditary/elective monarchy. In practice the moot has a lot of other powers because they have the interests of eleven thousand planets to juggle and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">The Emperor</a>'s exalted status does not give him more than twenty four hours a day to go through all that paperwork.
<ul><li> In practice the power of veto over succession was never exercised in the official timeline, and the Imperium is closer to a hereditary monarchy with the Moot just rubber-stamping whoever the last Emperor picked as heir. All this convoluted political tangle is realistic and shows just how complicated such things can be.
</li><li> One of the few instances in which the Moot does have an active hand in selecting the Emperor is when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">Right of Assassination</a> is invoked, in which case the Moot has to decide, usually after the fact, whether the assassin's claim is legit. Of course the first time someone claimed the throne that way the Moot had selected the assassin and planned her ascension to the throne before hand after realizing how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">insane</a> Cleon III was. During the Civil War the Moot generally just accepted whoever had done the deed as long as they also had control of the largest fleet.
</li><li> Notably during the Rebellion the Moot was dissolved by Lucan, the most legitimate surviving heir, soon after he was declared Emperor. Officially the suspension was temporary, "for one year". He didn't want them looking too closely into what had happened to his older twin brother Varian during Dulinor's attempted coup, and he didn't want them selecting a replacement through the Right of Assassination when he proved rather inept in his leadership. The Moot never officially met again and was unable to take any organized action to prevent the destruction of the Imperium as it descended into civil war.

<ul><li> The Rasalhague Principality/Free Republic/Dominion had their ruling Princes elected by parliament for up to two ten-year terms, from among members of the royal family and usually the previous Prince's son. When the Free Republic was conquered by the Clans the Elected Prince's son Ragnar Magnusson was taken as a bondsman by first Clan Wolf and then Clan Ghost Bear, where he earned freedom and rose to the rank of Star Colonel. Surprisingly the remnants of the Republic elected him Prince, enabling him to negotiate the merger of Clan Ghost Bear and the Free Rasalhague Republic into the Rasalhague Dominion.
</li><li> The Clans themselves also use elections to determine who will be their Khan. The Clan Council (made up of several hundred bloodnamed warriors) chooses a Khan from amongst themselves.

A Khan can also be removed at any time with a simple majority vote, again likely to be contested by trial.
</li><li> The High Lord/Lady of the Aurigan Coalition is elected by the Coalition's council of nobles and their decisions are subject to review (and potentially a veto) by a council majority. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleTech">This led to a brief civil war in the 3020s</a> as a pro-centralization faction briefly took power in the Coalition following a coup.

These candidates are voted on by Parliament, and even in the case of only one candidate for the post, the Parliament actually does have a confirmation process, even if that is largely a formality.

There is no requirement that any of the three be blood relatives, and traditionally one is chosen from each the military, the bureaucratic government structure, and industry. When it is time for a new Emperor, the Grand Council then elects one of those three, often choosing the career path that would best serve the Empire at the time.

This is the reason why Claudius is king instead of Hamlet himself. Hamlet describes his uncle as having "popp'd in between the election and my hopes", and later says that he foresees that "the election lights on Fortinbras" as he himself is dying (and the Danish royal line with him), giving his nod to Prince Fortinbras of Norway, whose leadership he had soliloquized approvingly about earlier.

<ul><li> This is one of the succession options available to feudal rulers of kingdoms and empires. Under elective succession, all of the dukes of the realm, plus the sovereign, get to vote on the heir to the crown. Used properly, it's extremely powerful, as it allows the player to select the most suitable heir, rather than the doddering idiot who just happened to be born first. Used improperly, it can result in your hard-earned imperial crown being wrested from your dynasty entirely. Appropriately, it's the default succession style of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire">Holy Roman Empire</a>—see below.
</li><li> A later patch added the 'Tanistry' succession law to the game which can be chosen by Celtic rulers (Irishmen, Picts, Scots, Welshmen, and Bretons).

This obviously doesn't affect counts since they only have one tier below them, and feudal elective has a special rule for empires where both kings and dukes get the vote.</span>, <em>every</em> landed noble in the realm gets a vote, not just the dukes, so getting the winner you actually want becomes near-impossible. Additionally, NPC voters in tanistry tend to prefer older candidates from other branches of the dynasty than your direct line of descent, which can complicate things further.
</li><li> Most unreformed pagans are restricted to elective gavelkind succession. On the one hand the successor has to be of the ruling dynasty, but if the decedent has multiple secondary heirs (i.e. the ruler has two sons and elects one), any same-tier title that the ruler controls enough land to create will be created for them automatically, dividing the realm. Unsurprisingly players prefer to ditch elective gavelkind as soon as possible, which means changing to an organized religion, or reforming your pagan faith into one.
</li><li> Eldership, a succession exclusive to Romuva and West African pagans, and any pagan that reform with the "Ancestor Veneration" doctrine. Here, the electing is done by a council of elders, with only dynasty members as candidates. If an elder is pleased, they will elect either the current monarch's choice or, at least, someone they consider competent and fit to rule. If they are not pleased, they will deliberately undermine the ruling dynasty by selecting incompetent candidates.

<ul><li> As a general rule, most monarchies were a combination of Elective and Hereditary whenever nobles had any usable degree of power; in a legally elective monarchy, the family of the previous King was often influential, and stood to gain prestige and favors (and thus votes). In a legally hereditary monarchy, rightful successors were known to be passed over for a more effective or popular family member, as an inability to control their vassals would result in the dynasty losing control of the monarchy. The end result of this was that certain nobles would make their wishes for the succession known directly to the king, who often had to balance the legal succession laws with the reality of the situation for the sake of a stable realm. While not legally elective monarchies, they had similar effects and political dynamics.
<ul><li> A peculiar attitude towards this is the British monarchy, where said nobles—plus some rich commoners—had formed themselves into a Parliament early on and had repeated disputes with the monarchs about who got to "settle the succession": that is, determine the law of who got to be King. After a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar">big war</a>, Parliament came out on top; to this day, the British succession is governed solely by statutory law passed by Parliament, and the will of the monarch is more or less only given weight as a practical consideration.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2p41l');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2p41l" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2p41l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"More or less", because—this being Britain—it's not quite that simple. The monarch is <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown-in-Parliament">at least nominally kind-of-sort-of part of Parliament<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> inasmuch as the monarch must <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Assent">approve bills and formally retains the right not to do so<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Therefore, at least in theory, a monarch could withhold Royal Assent for any bill altering the succession, and constitutionally this would be acceptable because the monarch would be acting in her/his capacity as the kind-of-sort-of third chamber of Parliament, and so "Parliament" would have rejected the change. That also being said, there are very strong conventions that monarchs will not use a "reserve power" like withholding Royal Assent to a bill that has passed the Lords and Commons, so (as happens so often) the force of tradition serves in place of formal legal barriers to keep the British system making sense.</span> Thus although the British monarchy <em>is</em> hereditary, it is indirectly elective, because Parliament decided to set down a predetermined hereditary succession law rather than elect a new monarch each time the monarch died or elect a designated successor while the monarch lives (both of which Parliament is legally entitled to do). So in a way, Britain is an elective monarchy where the electing body has decided that doing the actual elections would be too much work (and that it was desirable to continue with the French-derived system of the heir instantly taking the throne upon the monarch's death, avoiding any interregnum period in which the throne is empty) and simply set down a law that "automatically" elects the monarch's heir by primogeniture as the new monarch. Under the United Kingdom's system of parliamentary supremacy, the exact mechanism for succession can be and has been changed at will by a new vote of Parliament, most recently in 2013 to change from male-preference to absolute primogeniture and to remove the ban on those in line to the throne from marrying Catholics. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCommonwealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCommonwealth">The Commonwealth</a> adds the further wrinkle that at least some of the various Commonwealth Realms—the former colonies which retained constitutional monarchy on independence and remain in personal union with Britain—<em>also</em> have to approve the change, but on the two occasions it might have been a problem in 1936 and 2013, they did so with relatively little fuss.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3i3wo');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3i3wo" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3i3wo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In 1936, the Republican-led government of the Irish Free State made a point of symbolically dragging its feet, but only for a day.

However, while the electors were always some combination of secular rulers and prince-archbishops (i.e. archbishops who were also the secular rulers of some or all of their ecclesiastical province), <em>which</em> of the secular and clerical greats of the Empire would have the privilege was a frequent source of contention.
<ul><li> The original configuration of the electoral college is lost to history. The most likely configuration in the early period was that it was composed of some senior churchmen plus the secular rulers of the four "stem duchies" of Franconia, Saxony, Swabia, and Bavaria (the so-called "four tribes" of Germany). There's no direct documention of this, however, and a system based on the "stem duchies" can't have lasted long, as they were abolished in 1180 by Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa.
</li><li> The first document laying out a list of imperial electors is a 1265 letter by Pope Urban IV. The Pope, commenting on the election of 1257, said that, following "immemorial custom", the college had been composed of seven princes of the Empire. Four were secular rulers: the King of Bohemia, the Margrave of Brandenburg, the Count Palantine of the Rhine (who at the time was also the Duke of Bavaria) and the Duke of Saxony. The remaining three were the Archbishop-Electors of Mainz, Cologne, and Trier. This also maintained balance among the most major noble houses of the empire, as it gave only one electorate (the Palatinate) to the rising House of Wittelsbach while giving two (Brandenburg and Saxony) to the relatively neutral and pliant House of Ascania, and a fourth (Bohemia) to the Přemyslid dynasty, which didn't really consider itself a player in imperial politics. It also gave no electorates at all to the Houses of Hohenstaufen, Welf, and Habsburg (unless one of their junior members joined the clergy and became a prince-archbishop) which had been trading off being Emperor for the previous century, forcing them to rely more heavily on the lesser houses to win the crown.
</li><li> By the reign of Emperor Charles IV, the composition of the electoral college had become a point of contention, largely because of the rising ambitions and problems of three houses: the Wittelsbachs, the Luxembourgs, and the Habsburgs. Charles, a Luxembourg, had snagged Bohemia himself and was scheming more broadly to enhance his territory. Meanwhile, the Wittelsbachs had split the County Palatine from Bavaria under separate branches, and still a third Wittelsbach line had taken over in Brandenburg. On top of that, the Dukes of Austria under the House of Habsburg were gaining prominence, having been elected King but not crowned Emperor twice between the election of 1257 and Charles IV's day. <br/><br/>Each of these developments caused issues. The Wittelsbach rulers of Bavaria complained that they should have gotten an elctorate on the grounds that Bavaria (a major part of the Empire) was now unrepresented in the college, when before it had been. They were also annoyed that Bohemia got to vote, even though Bohemia wasn't German. Also, neither of the last two members of the Brandenburg Wittelsbach line had any heirs, so there was a risk that another Wittelsbach line might get it. Meanwhile, Austria was campaigning to be added to the college for nakedly political reasons. <br/><br/>Charles wasn't interested in having two or even three Wittelsbach electors if he could help it. He also saw Austria as a threat and kind of hated the Habsburgs' guts. Thus to silence the debate, he issued the Golden Bull of 1356, the first official, legal statement of who was an elector. The Bull legally confirmed the traditional configuration of Bohemia, Brandenburg, County Palatine, Saxony, Mainz, Cologne, and Trier. This would keep the Bavarian Wittelsbachs at the throats of their Palatinate cousins, while continuing to empower the Ascanias (whom Charles had in his pocket). A few years later, he was also successful in putting his own son on the throne of Brandenburg after forcing the last, childless Wittelsbach out. The Golden Bull would remain in effect for the rest of the Empire's existence—albeit not without modification.
</li><li> After the Golden Bull but before the Reformation, the electors generally gave the imperial title to the Luxembourgs, Wittelsbachs, and Habsburgs in alternation. During this period, Bavaria still sometimes stepped in anyway for the Palatinate (when the Bavarian Wittlesbachs' scheming against their Palatinate cousins was particularly successful) or for Bohemia (when the rival Wittelsbach branches took a break from messing with each other and instead conspired with each other to exclude Bohemia on the grounds that he wasn't German). The House of Ascania also died out in the 15th century, and was replaced in Saxony by the similarly neutral and pliant House of Wettin. After the Reformation, the Palatinate Wittelsbachs were Protestants and the Bavarian ones Catholics, so early in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThirtyYearsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThirtyYearsWar">Thirty Years' War</a> the (Catholic Habsburg) Emperor (who held his electorate as King of Bohemia) ganged up with the bishops to give the Wittelsbach electorate to the Bavarian branch. (The Emperor needed to rely on the bishops for this because at this point Saxony and Brandenburg were the leaders of the Protestant coalition within the Empire.) At the end of the war, the Peace of Westphalia gave a new, eighth electorate to the Protestant Palatinate Wittelsbachs in the interest of religious peace.
</li><li> At the end of the 17th century a ninth electorate was added for the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg (who became known as the Elector of Hanover). The Palatinate had passed to a Catholic junior branch of the territory's Wittelsbach line, and a new Protestant elector was needed to restore the religious balance. The House of Hanover was a junior branch of the Welfs, which had largely stopped being relevant in the 12th century and was thus seen as a safe choice for that role. Later, in the 1770s, the Bavarian Wittelsbachs died out, which in the end led to the Catholic Counts Palatine ruling Bavaria, as well; however, it was agreed that he would only have one vote (not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">that it</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars">ended up</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AllTheLittleGermanies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AllTheLittleGermanies">mattering</a>). The Electors of Hanover, incidentally, became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfHanover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfHanover">The House of Hanover</a> in Great Britain, meaning that the British monarch had a nominal hand in choosing the Emperor for about 100 years.
</li><li> The Imperial title became <em>de facto</em> hereditary within the House of Habsburg towards the end of the 15th century, when the Luxembourgs petered out—leaving much of their territory (most significantly Bohemia and its juicy electorate) to a Habsburg who had married a Luxembourg princess. (Meanwhile, Brandenburg went to the previously insignificant and Wettinesquely pliant House of Hohenzollern—though they wouldn't be insignificant or pliant for very long.) With the Wittelsbach branches at each other's throats about religion, the Imperial throne went to the Habsburgs time and time again basically by default. After this pattern settled in, the Electors generally did not keep the "obvious" heir from the throne until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOfTheAustrianSuccession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOfTheAustrianSuccession">War of the Austrian Succession</a> (although even before then the "obvious" heir would usually make a point of doing favors for the electors to keep them from holding up the vote when the time came).
<ul><li> The War of the Austrian Succession is an instructive example of how this worked in practice. The war came about because the male-line Habsburgs were dying out, and the last two agnatic Habsburgs, Joseph I and his brother Charles VI, had expended a lot of political capital getting the other electors to secure a Habsburg succession through their daughters should both of them die without male issue. The problem was that the deals they secured were contradictory: Joseph's deal put his daughters ahead of any Charles might have, but in 1713 Charles (by that point Emperor) flipped that and got the electors to agree. This <em>should</em> have secured the succession for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MariaTheresa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MariaTheresa">his daughter</a>, but when Charles VI died, the Duke of Bavaria successfully nobbled all the other electors<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5lc2z');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5lc2z" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5lc2z');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This included Hanover; as the election happened two years into the war and Britain—in personal union with Hanover—was <em>fighting on Austria's side</em>, this seems to have come as a bit of a shock to the Austrians. The Duke of Bavaria's brother, the Archbishop-Elector of Cologne, also voted for him, even though he had allied Cologne with Austria and favored the Habsburg succession.</span> and they backed him on the grounds that Charles VI's deal was improper and preference should have been given to the claims of his wife—one of Joseph I's daughters.
</li></ul></li><li> Incidentally all German kings/emperors can be placed into a single <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_tree_of_the_German_monarchs">family tree<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, not that it is a particularly readable or simple one, but still all of them from Charlemagne to Wilhelm II were more or less related to each other. This includes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoleon</a>, who married a Habsburg princess.
</li></ul></li><li> The United Arab Emirates, in theory at any rate: although the President is supposedly elected by the rulers of the seven emirates of the UAE, it's always the Emir of Abu Dhabi who holds the position of President, and the President always appoints the Emir of Dubai Prime Minister (unless the Emir of Dubai doesn't want/can't take the job, in which case his heir apparent takes it).
</li><li> In Denmark, the kings were elected from at least the Viking age until 1660. With a single exception all kings (and one woman, Queen Margrethe I, titled "Principal Lady and Husband of the North") came from the same family though, even if some spring around in the family tree were needed now and then. But it kept on, so today ruling queen Margrethe II can look back on a millennium-old family tree of Danish kings.
</li><li> In the same vein, Sweden elected its kings until the end of the 15th century, and all free men could vote. Of course, vote for the wrong candidate and you get your teeth kicked in, but hey, it's the thought that counts.
<ul><li> While every free man (or at least everyone belonging to the higher estates plus landowning farmers) technically could vote, the electorate usually consisted of the nobles, the bishops, their private armies, and assorted peasant revolts with a grudge.
</li><li> Sweden did it again in 1809, when the unpopular king Gustav IV Adolf and his descendants were forcibly removed and the parliament elected his uncle as Charles XIII. It is a bit unclear whether they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough">then realized the new king was 61 and childless</a> or did so <em>deliberately</em> as an interim solution while they looked for an actual new king to elect crown prince, and elected a Danish prince, Charles August, as crown prince in 1810. Then Charles August died of a stroke later that year, and they had to elect a new crown prince, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass">Marshall of the (French) Empire Jean Bernadotte</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note634bp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note634bp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note634bp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Who ironically had been very anti-monarchist in his youth, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingTattoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingTattoo">was rumored to have tattooed the radical republican slogan "death to all kings" on his chest</a>.</span>, thus starting the current dynasty of Swedish kings.
</li></ul></li><li> The medieval kings of Norway were likewise elected. The kings had to be recognized by the ruling body of nobles (Riksrådet) before being crowned. Before that, the commons, most often the farmers, had to recognize the kings at an open assembly. Historians are at odds on how this exactly worked when Denmark and Norway became a union, as Norwegians claim that <em>they</em> elected their kings, while Denmark was hereditary. The status for the union kings until 1660 was therefore: Crowned in Denmark and "elected" in Norway. Absolutism made an end to that mess.
<ul><li> To make things even more interesting: The founder of the modern royal family in Norway, Haakon VII/Prince Carl of Denmark, actually insisted on a referendum before taking position as king. Thus, he was actually originally elected by the Norwegian politicians. The referendum stated the support for monarchy, confirming to Prince Carl that the Norwegian people really did want him to become their new king.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note71fkr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note71fkr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note71fkr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though Danish by birth, he was <em>also</em> a direct descendant of 13th century Haakon V (the last king of an independent Norway until Haakon VII; all intervening Norwegian kings had also been king of either Denmark, Sweden or both), through both his father and his mother. Given the widespread intermarriage between European royal families, this is extremely common and thus few nations in Europe thought twice about inviting a "foreign" prince to be their king when the royal line dies out..</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The King of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VaticanCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VaticanCity">Vatican City</a>, better known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope">The Roman Catholic Pope</a>. Aside from being the head of the Catholic Church, he is the last absolute monarch in Europe and one of the last in the world. He is elected by a group of cardinals from among their number,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8vkdd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8vkdd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8vkdd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Technically they can choose any celibate Catholic man as Pope (though a layman would have to be elevated to deacon, then priest before enthronement). In practice, but for rare exceptions, only cardinals have been elected for over a thousand years.</span> hereditary monarchy being a rather difficult proposition for celibate Catholic clergy.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9vmv7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9vmv7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9vmv7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Not that it stopped some from trying by arranging for their nephews to succeed them. That's how the Catholic Church became the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism">Nepotism</a>. There's also at least one suspected case of a Pope being succeeded by his illegitimate son, since the requirement of celibacy wasn't always actually obeyed.</span> And in 2013, the Pope Emeritus Ratzinger (formerly Pope Benedict XVI) proved that the office isn't necessarily for life. While papal resignation had been on the books of Catholic Canon Law for as long as the records go back, it had been nearly 600 years since the last time a Pope had done so and over 700 years since a Pope had resigned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoup">willingly rather than at the point of a sword</a>.
<ul><li> While there hasn't been a Pope elected who wasn't currently a Cardinal in over six hundred years (Urban VI was the last, an archbishop before election), the only qualifications are that the person is a baptized, male practicing Catholic, of which there are over 600 million. That gives the Papacy the largest amount of possible candidates out of any elected office in the world.
</li></ul></li><li> France and its predecessor, the kingdom of the Franks, was at times, but the Carolingians and the Capetians both eventually overcame this by kings having sons crowned (nominally as co-regents) while they were still alive<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10zjz2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10zjz2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10zjz2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> On a few occasion these sons died before their fathers — it is not without significance that when this happened they were not included in the official numbering of kings of France.</span> as a form of multilayered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a>. Eventually, after several generations of doing this, the monarchy became hereditary (again). But the process was not totally irreversible, there was a period when the great lords of France alternated between making a Carolingian and a Capetian (then called Robertinian) king of France. Also, in Germany and Italy, the other successors state to the Frankish kingdom, attempts by various kings and emperors to do the same thing did not prevent their monarchy from becoming elective, with the Italic one eventually collapsing and being attached to the German one.
</li><li> The Most Serene Republic of Venice was one for all intents and purposes, given that the head of state (dux/doge/duke) was elected for life by the Great Council. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace">Venetians being Venetians</a>, the procedure was made <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge_of_Venice#Selection_of_the_Doge">an absurdly complex set of elections and lotteries to choose the actual electors<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to make sure it couldn't be fixed, with the doge being then presented to the people with the words "This is your doge, <em>if it please you</em>", as the people of Venice had the power to reject him and restart the whole mess (this ended in 1423 with the election of Francesco Foscari, as he and his successors were presented to the people with the words "This is your doge"). <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marino_Faliero">There was an attempt to give up with the election and turn it into a hereditary monarchy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, but the plot was discovered and the offending doge and his co-conspirators were executed. Faliero was then subject to a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson">damnatio memoriae</a></em> treatment, with his official portrait displayed in the Doge's Palace being removed. In its place was painted a black shroud and an inscription listing this why this was done.
</li><li> The King of Cambodia is elected by a council, even if there is a successor available, though the succession is limited to the two royal families.
</li><li> The Grand Master of the Order of Malta is elected for life.
</li><li> The King of Saudi Arabia is also technically elected. Technically, because of two caveats:
<ol><li> When the electors (the most senior princes of the House of Saud) vote, the King is generally still alive, and they thus usually elect a <em>Crown Prince</em>, to succeed the current King when he dies. Theoretically, if the King and Crown Prince die within a very short span of time, the princes might have to elect a King, but this has never happened.
</li><li> Until 2015, the prince-electors always elected the most-senior male member of the House of Saud deemed qualified for the job (some princes are ill, uninterested, or otherwise under suspicion, and thus aren't candidates in the first place). From <em>1953</em> until the custom ended in the 2015, this meant, basically, the oldest surviving son of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbdulAzizIbnSaud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbdulAzizIbnSaud">Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud</a>. That's right—it's been over sixty years since the man died, and until 2015, none of his grandsons were even close to the throne. However, in 2015, the decision was made to skip the last few sons of Abdul Aziz and hand the Crown Prince position to one of the grandsons, Muhammad bin Nayef. Then, in 2017, the family surprised everyone again by electing a younger grandson, Muhammad bin Salman, who (significantly) is a son of the reigning king, Salman bin Abdul Aziz.
</li></ol></li><li> The Mongols traditionally elected a Great Khan by and from among the Khans, who were more-or-less lords without landed estates because of the whole "nomad" thing. This is in fact what "Genghis" means-that "Great Khan"'s real name was Temujin.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AngloSaxons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AngloSaxons">Anglo-Saxons</a> were this, sort of. The Witenagemot: "council of wise men" (chief VIPs of the kingdom basically) chose who the king would be among the royal family. This has been exaggerated by patriotic Englishmen who wanted to emphasize Saxon's democratic virtues; all sorts of criteria could interfere, including the will of the previous monarch and sometimes simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">Asskicking Equals Authority</a>. Nonetheless it was something of an elective monarchy.
</li><li> A variation among various Celtic clans was called "Tanistry" in which the elders elected the <em>heir</em> to the chiefdom rather than the chief. Among other things, this would make it less likely that an election needed to be held during a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a>: if the old chief was suddenly killed in battle before his clan had time to discuss an impending succession the successor was ready. This custom carried on for a long time and was brought to America by Scots-Irish. It is notable though perhaps coincidental that the election for President of the United States always finishes several months before the previous one leaves office. The last vestige of this tradition may be found in the title of Ireland's deputy prime minister... <em>tanaiste</em>.
<ul><li> The period when Scotland was switching from this system to the more common primogeniture approach is the scene of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScottishTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScottishTrope">one of Shakespeare's more famous plays</a>-the title character of which is visibly shocked when the king names one of his sons as "Prince of Cumberland" (i.e., heir apparent). Following Duncan's murder, he's elected king, due to being a popular war hero who just saved them from a Norwegian invasion. In reality, Tanistry in Scotland had, by Macbeth's time, become a system where the succession alternated routinely between different branches of the MacAlpine family. This was why Macbeth believed he had a right to take the throne: it was his branch's turn.
</li></ul></li><li> The Crown of Aragon. Even though the elected king was almost invariably his predecessor's heir, the electors had little trouble reminding the candidate that they, in theory, could choose anyone, as this quotation from a 14th-century knight shows:
<div class="indent">[E]ach of us is as much as thou, but [we] all put together are much more than thou.
</div></li><li> The Visigothic Kingdom took this to its logical extreme with a ridiculously powerful noble council that not only had the power to elect kings (with at least one king, Wamba, allegedly being elected <em>against his will and <strong>at swordpoint</strong></em>), but also to depose them almost as they pleased. This made civil wars common, since rival factions often just denounced previous elections as invalid and chose their own king as the real one. Of 37 kings that reigned between the sack of Rome (410) and the death of the last one (721),<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1187z0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1187z0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1187z0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This doesn't count rebels who failed to take control of the capital and are thus not counted in official lists, yet styled themselves as kings.</span> 11 were murdered for sure, three more were deposed but not killed, and quite a handful more died in circumstances that are deemed suspicious.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire">The Roman Empire</a> effectively practiced this, the emperors being elected by the will of the Senate, the Army, and the people. Its inability to formalize the matter helped contribute to its fall. The Byzantine/ Eastern Roman Empire managed to make it mostly dynastic, which stabilized it from the situation where anyone could be emperor.
<ul><li> The Romans did it even when they were ruled by kings, in a rather complicated way: once the reigning king was dead, the Senate would nominate an <em>interrex</em> (king ad interim) for five days (after which he had to name a successor with the Senate's approval), who would choose a candidate for kingship and present it to the Senate for approval; if the Senate approved, the nominee would be brought before the Curiate Assembly (the assembly of <em>all</em> Roman citizens, even if only patricians could actually vote), presided over by the <em>interrex</em> for the occasion, for approval; if the Curiate Assembly approved, the nominee became king, but, the king also being the high priest, an augur (a priest tasked with interpreting the will of the gods by observing the flight of birds) would have to give his own approval; <em>if</em> the augur announced that the gods approved, the king was finally king, but to actually have the power he would have to summon the Curiate Assembly and propose a law in which he was given the <em>imperium</em> (absolute power), and if the bill passed he would <em>finally</em> be the king.
<ul><li> According to legend, they <em>still</em> managed to screw this up (first the sixth legendary king Servius Tullius skipped part of the process and, in spite of being a good king, was murdered in the Senate by his son-in-law for this, and then said son-in-law, Tarquinius Superbus, seized the throne but managed to piss off the people and barely escaped Rome with his life), so at one point they took away all power but <em>part</em> of the religious one, with the annual ceremony <em>Regifugum</em> (Flight of the King) having the king (now called <em>rex sacrorum</em>, king of sacrifices) interpreting Tarquinius Superbus' part as he was deposed and forced to run for his life to make sure he won't have funny ideas.
</li></ul></li><li> The Roman Empire effectively transitioned from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereditaryRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereditaryRepublic">Hereditary Republic</a> into this trope from the reign of Augustus onwards with no clear point in time during which a contemporary could say the transition had taken place. Only very few emperors were "born to the purple" (i.e. presumptive heir upon birth or childhood) as the Julio-Claudian dynasty never had a straightforward father-son transition, the Flavian dynasty came to power when Vespasian's sons were already men and the "five good emperors" Nerva to Marcus Aurelius had no biological children bar the last one. It says a lot for the little regard the Romans held for the dynastic principle that the fact Marcus Auerlius made his son emperor (who did turn out a terrible ruler) is often seen as an incredible faux-pas and the beginning of the end. Most Emperors did however make their desired heir "co-emperor" during their lifetime and the savier ones tried to get them a military command and have the senate rubber stamp the appointment to have two of the three bases of power (the third being the urban masses in Rome) in their corner from the get-go.
</li></ul></li><li> Andorra is an odd example. It is ruled by two co-princes (technically making it a diarchy rather than a monarchy). One of them used to be the King of France but after the French Revolution the position has been held by the President of France, an elected official, though elected by citizens of France rather than Andorra. The other, the Bishop of Urgell (in Spain) is (being a Catholic bishop) ultimately appointed by the Pope (in a complicated process also involving the local archbishop, the Roman Curia, and the Apostolic Nuncio—i.e. Vatican Ambassador—to the country).
</li><li> The King of the Belgians nominates his heir, but Parliament must confirm, and may choose another member of the royal family.
</li><li> In Kuwait, the Emir appoints with the advice and consent of the National Assembly, a "Crown Prince and Deputy Emir", who is a member of the Al Sabah Clan, but not someone in his immediate family. The last Emir hadn't bothered to appoint anyone else after his successor fell ill—too ill to become Emir—so when he died the Assembly passed him over for another relative.
</li><li> The Kingdom of Hawai'i had the king's choice of heir confirmed by a council of nobles and later parliament. When the House of Kamahameha failed, the noble chosen by parliament called for a referendum to confirm it.
</li><li> Malaysia:
<ul><li> Nine out of the thirteen states have hereditary rulers. Every five years, they choose among themselves a Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King), the head of state of the country. In practice, the position rotates among the nine rulers based on the seniority of the rulers when the system was created.
</li><li> One of the states, Negeri Sembilan <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12g6en');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12g6en" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12g6en');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Coincidentally, the name means "Nine States", as it is traditionally divided into nine chiefdoms</span> is an elective monarchy itself. The ruler is chosen from the princes of the royal family by a council of chiefs.
</li></ul></li><li> While it is hard to know for sure (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">one of the few written sources</a> on the matter is not always reliable or all that detailed when it comes to that matter), some historians suppose this is what happened with the kingdoms of Israel and Judah in biblical times. During the reign of Kings Saul, David and Solomon the king was strong/convincing/charismatic enough to convince the nobles in the part where being king wasn't hereditary to support the same candidate where it was. The whole system broke down when they could not agree on a successor to King Solomon and hence the two states split.
</li><li> Many Native American tribes had elected rulers (who Europeans invariably called "kings" though in many cases they probably didn't qualify), such as the Iroquois, where chiefs were chosen by clan elders (both male and female). However, the position was still mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMale">always male</a>. The Aztec emperors (<em>Huey Tlatoque</em>) were not hereditary, but elected by a consensus of the elites.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam">Islamic</a> World the Caliphs, successors to Muhammad, were originally elected by consensus of the community. The first four Caliphs, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashidun_Caliphate">Rashidun Caliphate<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> were elected in this fashion as Sunni Muslims believed Muhammad had originally intended before Muawiyah, the sixth caliph, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averted</a> this trope and turned the Caliphate into what is known as the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_Caliphate">Umayyad Dynasty<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a hereditary monarchy.
</li><li> Historically done by the various monarchies that had claimed rulership over Italy, though in different manners every time. Aside for the Roman Empire, we have:
<ul><li> Odoacer's <em>Regnum Italicum</em> (Italic Kingdom) was nominally elective, with the Roman Senate electing the king. In actual practice this didn't happen, as Zeno, Eastern Roman Emperor, saw him as a potential rival and had Italy conquered by the Ostrogoths.
</li><li> In the Ostrogothic <em>Regnum Italiae</em> the nobles had the power to elect and <em>depose</em> the king as they pleased, similar to their relatives the Visigoths. In practive, however, the nobles exercised the right to depose the king only during the war with the Eastern Roman Empire, when the elder Theodahad proved himself unable to stop the invasion, his successor Witiges was captured in battle and carried off to Constantinople, and Eraric tried to surrender for money.
</li><li> The Lombards' <em>Regnum Totius Italiae</em> (Kingdom of All Italy) was a more traditional elected monarchy, with the king elected among the Dukes.
</li><li> The Carolingian <em>Regnum Italiae</em> (or <em>Regnum Italicum</em>) was a Frankish-style elective monarchy, that for a while continued keeping the Imperial Crown. Eventually that was abandoned, and disputes among the nobles led to the Kings of Germany to overwhelm the Italic Kingdom and attach its (eventually largely nominal) crown to the German one as part of the Holy Roman Empire.
</li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfItalianIndependence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfItalianIndependence">Wars of Italian Independence</a>, most of Italy had been conquered by the Kingdom of Sardinia led by the House of Savoy, that legitized the conquests through plebiscites and then used the same means to elect Victor Emmanuel II as King of Italy.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, one of the demands of the Italian patriots to continue supporting the monarchy was for a referendum to either confirm or remove the monarchic regime to be held after victory. Due king Victor Emmanuel III abdicating about a month before the referendum, thus reminding everyone <em>why</em> they were holding it in the first place, the referendum resulted in 54% in favor of a republic, with the new king Umberto II, who had already proved himself an exceptional ruler as a regent, choosing exile rather than pointing out the possibility of a fraud and causing a civil war.
</li><li> In the current Italian constitution, the President of the Republic has effectively all the powers the king used to have (up to include being protected by a <em>lèse-majesté</em> law) but is elected by the Parliament in a joint session, plus the delegates of the regions, for a seven years term. There's no legal limit to the number of terms a President can serve, but in practice they traditionally serve only one.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13jjc4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13jjc4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13jjc4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The eleventh, Giorgio Napolitano, is the only one who has ever served twice, but had to be candidated by others that feared the political instability at the time would deadlock the election of any other candidate, and he only accepted to run, and was promptly elected, after the <em>fifth</em> ballot failed to produce a President. He would then resign in 2015 due to his advanced age.</span>
