<div class="indent">— <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">1 Corinthians 13:11</a></em>
</div></div><p>Some items, such as photographs, jewellery, stuffed toys and family heirlooms, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MementoMacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MementoMacGuffin">are imbued with more worth than money can buy.</a> They have sentimental value, and are a powerful link with a person or a memory. They can't be replaced on an insurance policy if they get stolen, because even if the replacement is identical, it doesn't have the same value as the original—it lacks the same connotations.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>As such, these items are protected zealously, both in real life and in fiction. Sometimes they act as comfort blankets, when the protagonist is far from home and missing his mother. Sometimes, they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicKeepsake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicKeepsake">all they have to remind them</a> of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown">Doomed Hometown</a>. Either way, the audience is usually informed of these items' deep significance.
</p><p>But occasionally, there comes a time when you decide that whatever that trinket represents is no longer important, or, more drastically, you come to realize that the person or memory it binds you to are not people or memories you want to be associated with any more. Maybe the boyfriend who gave the heroine her heart-shaped pendant has been two-timing her for the past year, or an ice skater finally realizes that they're too badly injured to make it as a champion, making their favourite skating boots a painful reminder of their lost dream. Either way, it's time to get rid of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Usually, the item is an innocent scapegoat—the pendant itself didn't betray its owner, and the ice skates weren't driving the car that hit the protagonist. It's just that the hero(ine) can't actually get their hands on the person that's caused the problem, <em>especially</em> if the change or misfortune is down to nothing more than luck or time. Characters who can get their revenge, and have no qualms about doing so, don't tend to bother with destroying jewelry—they just go and punch the offender's face in. It's the gentler, less violent characters, or those who really have no actual person they can blame, who decide It's All Junk and get rid of a fairly innocuous item. Their destruction is purely symbolic, to show that the character is finishing a chapter of their lives and starting a new one.
</p><p>It is quite rare for these objects to be sold, even if they are actually quite valuable. They're either destroyed (often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnBabyBurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnBabyBurn">with fire</a>) or discarded (if the hero is getting rid of them because they want nothing more to do with what they symbolise) or passed on to someone else (if the hero is acknowledging that their time in a particular role has passed and wants to hand the item down to someone who can make better use of it). By not even claiming the money they would make from a sale, the character further acknowledges that they reject their trinket and everything it stands for.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Sometimes it's not even a trinket—it can be something as big as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetThePastBurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetThePastBurn">a house</a> or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereIWasBornAndRazed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereIWasBornAndRazed">a home town.</a> Rarely, it might be a pet, though this has to be dealt with sensitively. A potentially callous example would be to discard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveNoSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveNoSon">one's own child</a> if said child either fails to meet expectations, or for the child to be a painful reminder of a spouse who had left or betrayed the parent in some way and the child who is the product of the two parents ends up as a scapegoat for the bitter feelings toward the spouse.
</p><p>Broadly speaking, the destruction of an item in a fit of It's All Junk can be quite sad; chances are, the audience will feel much the same about what the thing represents as the character does. If it's something established to have a personality (a pet or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon">Empathic Weapon</a>) it can be downright heartbreaking.
</p><p>Certain significant items, however, may <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyMacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyMacGuffin">refuse to be discarded...</a>

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HaibaneRenmei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HaibaneRenmei">Haibane Renmei</a></em>, Kuu, the smallest of the Haibane, gives a large winter coat to Rakka, the newest Haibane. Rakka appreciates the gift, but only fully realizes its significance when the others explain to her that Kuu had kept the coat, which was too big for her, in the hope that she would eventually grow into it. By passing it over to Rakka, Kuu accepts that she will never grow to be as big as the other members of her group. This is a major turning point in the series - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> shortly afterwards, Kuu ascends in her "Day of Flight," which the Haibane can only achieve after dealing with their personal issues. In Kuu's case, this seems to have been disappointment in her status as a small, "unimportant" member of their society - which Rakka helps her overcome, by accepting Kuu's guidance and acknowledging the little Haibane as her senior/sempai.</span> By giving the coat to Rakka, Kuu showed that she was content with who she was, and prepared to move on rather than chase the impossible.
</li><li> Juri, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em>, has a locket with a picture of her unrequited crush, Shiori. She throws it into the lake in an attempt to distance herself from the manipulative Shiori (water seems to be a popular method of disposal for such items...) only to have it return to her later in what seems to be a case of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyMacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyMacGuffin">Clingy MacGuffin</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's not really - the locket doesn't make its own way back to Juri, someone plants it where Shiori will find it, and she then uses it to taunt Juri</span>. When Utena finally destroys the locket in a duel, Juri finally begins to move on with her life rather than mourn her unrequited love.
</li><li> Manga angstfest <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MARS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MARS">MARS</a></em> sees the painting that brought the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a> together in the first place incinerated, when the two lovers begin to doubt whether they can stay together.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em> Jet keeps a broken pocket watch as a memento of his former lover Alyssa, who had walked out on him one day and left only the watch and a goodbye note without an explanation. Eventually Jet returns to Ganymede and meets up with Alyssa, now running a failing bar and having hooked up with a former criminal. She explains that she left Jet because she was tired of being taken care of and controlled, and prefers to try living on her own merits even if it means failing. Having obtained the closure of an explanation and realizing he's been unhealthily hung up on his own past (symbolized by the 'frozen time'), Jet tosses the broken watch into a canal and moves on.
</li><li> Although it wasn't entirely Sara's <em>choice</em> to have her musical necklace stolen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrainStrategicArmoredInfantry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrainStrategicArmoredInfantry">Str.A.In.: Strategic Armored Infantry</a></em>, nor was it Ralph's to have his crayon drawing blown to bits later on, it still strongly symbolizes that their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel">connection</a> has been severed and one of them will have to kill the other, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherWorship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherWorship">Big Brother Worship</a> or not.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Planetes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Planetes">Planetes</a></em>, Yuri loses his wife in a spaceship accident in the opening seconds of the series. Her antique compass was in her hand, and it contained a message Yuri never got to read. He passes up lucrative opportunities in space industry to be an orbital garbage collector, secretly hoping against phenomenal odds to find that watch. By a small miracle, he manages to collect it; the message was "Please Save Yuri". However, as he finally comes to terms with his loss, he gives the watch to his co-workers brother, an amateur rocket builder, and tells him to put it back in space.
</li><li> Throughout the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, Suzaku hangs onto his father's pocketwatch despite the fact that it was broken a long time ago; later on, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lelouch shoots Euphemia dead, he leaves the watch with her corpse. Rather than marking the point where he leaves the past and looks towards the future, however, this serves to further reinforce his being tied to the past, but now by his rage over Euphy's death rather than his own guilt over killing his father</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveFreak">America</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em> tries to do this with all the gifts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor">England</a> gave him when he was a child during the colonial period, but in the end can't bring himself to do it.
</li><li> The house of the Elric Brothers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> serves as this. After Ed got his state alchemist license, they burned the house where they had lived with their mother and the same place where they tried to revive her through human transmutation before going on their quest to find the Philosopher's Stone. According to Pinako Rockbell, the Elric brothers think if they do not have a home to return to, then the could continue moving forward and not have to turn back. Hoemheim however states the <em>real</em> reason they burned the house was because they didn't want to face the reality of their mistake and were running away from the problems they should have faced instead.
</li><li> A variation occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiYoriAoshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiYoriAoshi">Ai Yori Aoshi</a></em>. When Aoi wants to know why Kaoru ran away from home, thus annulling their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyArrangedMarriage">Happily Arranged Marriage</a>, he explains that he was the product of an affair between the son the head of the powerful Hanabishi family, and a common woman. When Kaoru's father died, his mother was forced by the Hanbishi family to hand him over to them to be groomed to be heir to Hanabishi name, and he was ordered to have as little contact with his mother as possible. When she died, he went to their old home to get some mementos, only to find that his grandfather had burned anything that had belonged to his mother. When he takes a birth charm, the last thing that held a connection to his mother, Kaoru's grandfather orders him to burn it so that his mother can be wiped out from memory. When he refuses, Karou's grandfather beats him, and shortly after that, he runs away from home and renounces the Hanabishi name.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HaruAndMidori" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HaruAndMidori">Haru and Midori</a></em>, the eponymous duo visits Haru's house to collect her late mother(Midori's best friend)'s belongings. Haru says she'd like to throw the belongings away, since they only serve to remind her that her mother's gone for good.

Which would have been a bit more plausible if the story introducing the costume hadn't had as a plot point that it was extremely fire-resistant.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GothamCityGarage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GothamCityGarage">Gotham City Garage</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl">Barbara Gordon</a> is tricked into believing her sister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl">Kara</a> murdered their father. At one point she rips up Kara's comics. Then she remembers they were their father's and feels even worse.
<div class="indent"><strong>Barbara:</strong> I tried hating you. On one particularly bad night, I tore up your illegal comics. It was only afterward I remembered they were Dad's. I tried hating him, too. That didn't work either.
</div></li><li> An especially poignant example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Preacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Preacher">Preacher</a></em>, where the "junk" is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">Saint</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGunslinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGunslinger">of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">Killers</a>' <em>corpse,</em> the skeleton of his mortal body before he became Heaven's hit man. Jesse Custer digs it up to get the Saint's attention; the Saint says "This ain't but bones" and smashes it.
<ul><li> On the other hand, Jesse <em>did</em> get the Saint's undivided-and-pissed-off attention with that stunt, so he may Protest Too Much.
</li></ul></li><li> An interesting example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em>, Dr. Manhattan had always treasured a picture he has of himself when he was normal and his ex-wife. He just went ahead and dropped it on the ground showing him disregarding his last ties to humanity.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield">Garfield</a> picture book <em>Garfield's Judgement Day</em>, Garfield convinces the pets of his hometown to break their taboo against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingAnimal">talking</a> so they can warn their owners of an approaching natural disaster. One of these animals, an old dog, is unable to convince his elderly owner to leave their house. The man explains that he has no life outside of the house anymore since all of his memories are in it and at his age memories are all he has. The dog refuses to abandon his owner and waits for the oncoming storm. After the storm passes, the old man's house is wrecked and the dog is apparently dead, though the man himself is unhurt. The old man grieves over his friend, declaring that his memories and the house don't mean anything to him anymore since his dog is more important. Fortunately the old dog was just playing dead.

Turns out the actual family fortune doesn't exist in some cartoonish Scrooge McDuckian vault, but like any sane wealthy family, is tied up in investments. The Riches firmly believe that A) sentimental value is much more important than fiscal value and B) the best place for money is in a bank, where it'll make some interest. The antagonist, predictably, is annoyed by this healthy and fiscally responsible outlook.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SawIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SawIII">Saw III</a></em> has a brutal <em>forced</em> example of this trope.

This is epitomized by the climactic scene after his second wife walks out on him, Kane totally trashes her room like a mindlessly destructive machine rebelling against the superficial materialism that has helped ruin having any real meaning in his life. In a morbid turn of this trope, maybe the only one of his thousands of material objects that might've meant something to him, Rosebud, is burned up at the end of the film by the managers of his estate, with the order of "Throw that junk out!" There's a reason for why this movie became the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">It Was His Sled</a>.

Grace realizes that the two of them were merely chosen as the "students who caused the least problems for teachers," and is so disappointed that she not only gets rid of the ring, but forbids her proud parents from even mentioning it.
<ul><li> Come to think of it, Grace's entire life is a series of It's All Junk moments.

Ben points this out and takes it as evidence that the man cannot be the Doctor.
</li><li> The Fourth Doctor regenerates with a tamed, tidy, well-combed, dandyish hairstyle that is almost identical to the one worn by the Third Doctor.

</li><li> When the Fifth Doctor is wandering through the TARDIS in a delirious state after regenerating, he unravels the Fourth Doctor's signature super-long scarf as he goes, eventually working it down to nothing.
</li><li> The Fifth Doctor's 'death' storyline leads to him - and his pristine white and cream outfit - getting progressively more tattered and dirty, eventually being filthy rags by the time of his demise.
</li><li> The Seventh Doctor begins his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CostumeTestMontage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CostumeTestMontage">Costume-Test Montage</a> with an emphasised shot of him <em>very firmly</em> tossing the Sixth Doctor's coat into a trunk.

</li><li> The Eleventh Doctor's regeneration from the Tenth, which also signified a new showrunner taking over, leads to him destroying the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies">Russell T Davies</a>-era TARDIS (which changes into a new version) and shredding the Tenth Doctor's clothes to ragged ribbons.
</li><li> Just before the Eleventh Doctor regenerates into the Twelfth, he takes off his bowtie and there is a significant shot of it falling to the floor before the Twelfth Doctor suddenly bursts into existence.
</li><li> At one point in the Twelfth Doctor's first episode, he is disguising himself with a mask made out of human skin. The face of the mask looks just like the Eleventh Doctor's.

One of the books happens to be a copy of <em>Daring Do and the Sapphire Stone</em>, which she gives to Rainbow Dash in consolation for her failed trade for a first edition copy. Double subverted when the books are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTheSet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTheSet">destroyed along with the library</a> at the climax of the season finale.

After betraying Discord and draining him of his magic, he uses this to explain that giving the medallion to Discord as a symbol of gratitude was an empty gesture. However, when Discord gives the medallion to Twilight after his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">Heel Realization</a>, it becomes the final key to the Chest of Harmony.

Timmy is a little reluctant to get rid of his talking Crimson Chin action figure because, even though he's outgrown it, he had a lot of fun with it. After the plot of the episode is over (which revolved around how miserable Tooty's life as Vicky's sister is), he ends up wishing for the toy to become indestructible, for its catchphrases to insult Vicky, and gives it to Tooty as a memento that Vicky can't ruin for her.

It turns out that the culprit is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Cartman himself, pretending that it was one of his dolls who was murdering the others because it "understood" that it was time for Cartman to grow up and get rid of his dolls.
