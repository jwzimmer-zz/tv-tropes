<p>Someone is accused of a crime they did not commit, and must haul ass to prove their innocence.
</p><p>Sometimes, the person accused of the crime is someone else, who is incapable of proving their own innocence. Maybe they've already been arrested or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiscarriageOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiscarriageOfJustice">convicted</a>, and had the key thrown away long ago. Maybe the evidence is stacked up against them and almost nobody believes them. Maybe they're just not badass enough to do it themselves. Either way, it's up to the hero to buck the odds and naysayers, find the evidence and Clear Their Name.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>The poor sap locked up will usually have one person â€” often a beloved relative or a best friend (who's actually in love with them, hence their fixated devotion) â€” who remains committed to their cause, and who brings in the often-initially skeptical heroes to investigate the case. In some cases, the loved one's devotion to the wrongfully accused will persist even if the wrongfully accused has given up hope of being exonerated. If the hero's good enough, they may learn of the case independently and offer their services to the skeptical police, who are convinced they've got the right person locked up. In some cases, the police might be corrupt and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Frameup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Frameup">actively perpetuating</a> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiscarriageOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiscarriageOfJustice">Miscarriage of Justice</a> in order to obscure the true culprit or another crime.
</p><p>Given the nature of the trope, it usually occurs in media which involves defense attorneys or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateDetective">Private Detectives</a> unaffiliated by the police, although particularly conscientious police officers may find themselves also working to clear some innocent's name.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Occasionally the person who's locked will up be guilty after all. Another popular twist is to have the guilty party be the one who wants the accused cleared (often because of feelings of guilt) but doesn't have the guts (or in some odd cases can't prove it as it looks like they're just taking the fall for them) to confess.

</li><li> Takes place more than once in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>, with people hiring Kogoro to prove that they didn't do something they've been accused of.

</li><li> It's not really a <em>crime</em>, but it would count into this trope: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KotouraSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KotouraSan">Kotoura-san</a></em>, Yuriko's mother was falsely accused of having faked her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses">Super Senses</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and was eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a></span>, an accusation that existed up to this day.

</li><li> Variation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster">Monster</a></em>: the hero, Dr. Tenma, <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WronglyAccused" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WronglyAccused">Wrongly Accused</a>. However, he doesn't really care about clearing his name, considering stopping Johan, the actual culprit, much more important. However, some of his friends <em>do</em> care, and spend their time piecing together information in the interests of proving Tenma innocent.
</li><li> In an arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom">Assassination Classroom</a></em>, planted evidence makes everyone believe Koro-sensei is an underwear thief, causing his students' trust in him to dwindle. However, some of those students eventually catch on that while Koro-sensei <em>is</em> a pervert, there's no way he'd do something so low as stealing underwear, as losing his students' trust would be worse to him than dying. So they decide to investigate in order to find the real culprit and clear their teacher's name.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> An old story revealed that Spidey's parents Richard and Mary had been secret agents who had been killed in action by a supervillain, then framed as traitors as a final insult. Spidey then went on a quest to clear his parents' names.
</li><li> Betty Brant cleared the name of his dead husband, Ned Leeds, when she revealed that Roderick Kingsley was the real Hobgoblin (Ned was brainwashed in believe to be Hobglobin by Kingsley).
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGwen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGwen">Spider-Gwen</a></em>. When Gwen reveals her identity as Spider-Woman to her father, he tries to stop the NYPD from targeting her for the death of Peter Parker. When he's removed from the case, he begins looking into the true story privately in order to clear her daughter's name. However, not only <em>is</em> Gwen technically responsible for Peter's death, as her fight with the Lizard-fied Peter Parker only worsened the effects of the poisonous serum, but Captain Stacy is eventually forced to admit that no one actually cares about what really happened. All people care about is having a scapegoat to blame all their problems on, and Peter's death gave them an excuse to use Spider-Woman as one. Captain Stacy quits his job and burns all evidence that Peter was the Lizard as a result.

Jimmy Stewart is <em>Chicago Times</em> reporter P.J. MacNeil trying to find evidence that two men in prison for killing a policeman 11 years ago are innocent. This superbly acted, suspenseful picture was made in 1948, and showcased all sorts of post-WWII shiny new technology, like miniature cameras and photograph wire transfers. Venturing repeatedly into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/OlderThanTheyThink/Technology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/OlderThanTheyThink/Technology">Older Than They Think - Technology</a> territory, it was like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em> of its time.

<ul><li> Needless to say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> did this on multiple occasions:
<ul><li> <em>The Blue Carbuncle</em>; in this one, Holmes enters this plot independently of the main investigation, having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingTheSameCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingTheSameCase">entered the case following a seemingly unrelated and trivial matter elsewhere</a>.
</li><li> As is <em>The Boscombe Valley Mystery</em>. Although he's brought in by Lestrade originally, Holmes becomes convinced that the suspect is innocent early on and is encouraged to investigate further by said young man's childhood friend, who'd very much like to be his girlfriend, actually.
</li><li> <em>The Norwood Builder</em> is another example, in which a young man was accused of murdering a wealthy old curmudgeon who had recently named him his heir.
</li><li> <em>The Man With The Twisted Lip</em>. While not his primary objective, Holmes does prove that the titular man did not abscond with the missing man while figuring out what happened to him.
</li><li> <em>The Beryl Coronet</em>. Holmes was mainly concerned with finding the missing part of the coronet, but he did prove that the banker's son was not the one who stole it in the process.
</li><li> <em>Silver Blaze</em>. Holmes' primary concern was finding the missing horse, not proving that the man arrested for stealing it (and killing the stable master) wasn't responsible, even though he ultimately did both.
</li><li> <em>Thor Bridge</em>. Holmes proved the governess had not murdered the client's wife.
</li><li> <em>Sussex Vampire</em>. Holmes proved that the wife's apparent sucking of her child's blood was not malicious and had absolutely nothing to do with vampirism. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She was trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuckOutThePoison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuckOutThePoison">Suck Out the Poison</a>, as the baby boy had been cut with a poisoned dart <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">his jealous, hunchbacked older half-brother used on him</a>.</span>
</li><li> <em>Lion's Mane</em>. Holmes proves that Murdoch was not responsible for McPherson's death (not that there was sufficient evidence to arrest in this case).
</li><li> <em>Dancing Men</em>. Holmes was hired to investigate some strange drawings by a man who is later killed. He cracks the code and proves that the man sending the coded messages was the killer, not the client's wife, who not only was wrongfully accused of killing the man but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> had been seriously injured <em>and</em> quite at risk of being hanged if she ever recovered.</span>
</li><li> <em>A Study in Scarlet</em>. Inspector Gregson arrested a suspect for the first murder, and Holmes later found the man who committed both murders (to be fair, Gregson's suspect <em>did</em> have a plausible motive).
</li><li> <em>The Sign of the Four</em>. Athelney Jones arrests virtually everyone present at the murder scene for complicity in the murder. After Holmes tracked down the parties responsible it turned out that <em>one</em> of the people Jones had arrested really was involved, which doesn't change the fact that Holmes had cleared the names of everyone else in that household.
</li><li> <em>Noble Bachelor</em>. At one point the missing woman's maid was suspected of either kidnapping her or working with an unidentified kidnapper. Holmes proved that no kidnapping had taken place.
</li><li> <em>Black Peter</em>. While Neligan was caught red-handed in attempted burglary (of stock certificates stolen from his murdered father, and thus were arguably his property to begin with), he did not kill Black Peter, and Holmes was able to find the true killer.
</li><li> <em>Abbey Grange</em> has a unique version. An unidentified American police officer clears the Randall gang of a murder in Kent by arresting them for their other crimes in New York the morning after the murder (overnight travel from England to America being impossible in 1897).
</li><li> <em>The Bruce-Partington Plans</em>. A state secret has been stolen, and suspicion falls on a clerk who was murdered the same night (some of the papers, but not the most important, were found in his pocket). The dead man's fiancee appeals to Holmes to save his honor, as she puts it. He was already on the case for a different reason - figuring out what had happened to the missing papers.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Wicked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Wicked">Wicked</a></em>. Glinda volunteers to tell the Ozians that Elphaba isn't a wicked witch - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">but Elphaba makes her promise not to, so the government won't do the same to her to keep her quiet.</a>
</li><li> This happens to pilot Tycho Celchu in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">X-Wing Series</a></em> - he was briefly held by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>'s mistress of brainwashing, so he's suspected of having been turned, they dumped thousands of credits into his bank accounts, he was seen with someone who from behind looked liked one of the prominent Imperials, and he was in position to kill Corran Horn. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Who did not actually die</span>. All the Rogues indicate that they think he's innocent, but not a lot of others share that opinion. It's mentioned that most of the evidence is circumstantial, but there's a mountain of it, so it looks like he's either guilty and made to look innocent through a clumsy frame, or innocent made to look guilty clumsily made to look innocent. This is what the bad guys intend, since his trial adds to the New Republic's problems-it's planned that evidence will be released to prove him innocent after he's been found guilty and put to death. Wedge Antilles eventually does find evidence of the <em>real</em> traitor <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Erisi Dlarit. It helps that just a few minutes prior, the "victim" had entered the courtroom (nullifying the murder charge in the process, but not the other charges), and had figured out not only the identity of the traitor, but also that one of the investigatorsâ€”General Cracken, Intelligence chiefâ€”already knew that Tycho was innocent (but he did not if he wasn't a real Imperial agent, just framed in this case for some plot). Cracken, however, deliberately let the trial continue in hopes of flushing out the real traitor, and after the trial took steps to make sure that Tycho's good name was restored.</span>

Luckily, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> Nat finds the child who can verify that she hasn't done anything wrong, and brings her to the courthouse in time to save Kit from conviction.
</li><li> In the 1925 novel <em>Not Under the Law</em>, protagonist Joyce Radway leaves home after a fight with her cousin and takes up residence in a city some miles away. No one knows what's become of her, but several months later she happens to see her hometown newspaper and discovers that a close childhood friend has been accused of her murder. She heads home in time to interrupt the trial and prove that she's still alive.
</li><li> This is the plot of Sarah Caudwell's mystery <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HilaryTamar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HilaryTamar">Thus Was Adonis Murdered</a></em>: Julia gets arrested for murder while on holiday in Venice, and Hilary has to remotely solve the murder so as to get her off.

Said brother-in-law, Max, was accused of having bribed several witnesses no falsely acuse two men so he could have them hung.
</li><li> This is most of the plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Iorich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Iorich">Iorich</a></em>. Aliera was arrested on a very stupid, transparent charge and she refuses to talk to a lawyer or put up a decent defense. Vlad decides that even if she is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a>, he'd still prefer she didn't get executed, and he finds the idea of her owing him her life hilarious.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeistSociety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeistSociety">Heist Society</a></em>, Kat is dragged back into the family business when her father is accused of stealing from a very dangerous man. The only way to keep her father and the rest of her family safe is to steal the paintings back.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/APassageToIndia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/APassageToIndia">A Passage to India</a></em>, set in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRaj" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRaj">British Raj</a>, Dr. Aziz is falsely accused of attempted rape by Englishwoman Adela Quested, prompting his friends Cyril Fielding, Vikram Hamidullah, and Mahmoud Ali to rally around him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Adela ultimately withdraws her accusation</span>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TommyAndTuppence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TommyAndTuppence">Tommy and Tuppence</a></em> story "Finessing the King/The Gentleman Dressed In Newspaper", Inspector Marriot arrests the victim's lover, and tells Tommy and Tuppence repeatedly that it's an open-and-shut case. Tuppence realises that he's trying to wind them up, since his instincts tell him the man is innocent, but is constrained by the evidence.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HerculePoirot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HerculePoirot">Hercule Poirot</a></em>
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiveLittlePigs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiveLittlePigs">Five Little Pigs</a></em>, Carla Lemarchant hires Poirot to clear her mother of her father's murder, even though her mother died in prison sixteen years earlier.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SadCypress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SadCypress">Sad Cypress</a></em>, Dr. Peter Lord hires Poirot to clear Elinor Carlisle of the murder of Laura Welman and Mary Gerrard, despite the fact that there's no other suspect, and the evidence seem to overwhelmingly point to Elinor.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TowardsZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TowardsZero">Towards Zero</a></em>, Poirot's friend, Superintendent Battle must deal with this a few times. First, his daughter is accused of stealing from other girls in her school after being pressured to confess to the crime. This comes into play in the actual investigation, where the evidences seem to strongly implicate a particular suspect, whose mannerism in their eventual confession mirrors Battle's own daughter. This convinces Battle that the suspect is actually innocent.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MrsMcGintysDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MrsMcGintysDead">Mrs. McGinty's Dead</a></em>, Superintendent Spence gets Poirot involved because the murder victim's lodger has already been convicted, but Spence isn't convinced. Apparently, his sullen, diffident demeanour during the trial was guaranteed to look unsympathetic to the jury, but in the Super's experience is entirely unlike how real murderers behave in court.

The book was written and set in the early 1930s and suicide was illegal for several centuries in England and Wales (until it ceased to be an offence with the passing of the Suicide Act of 1961).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1zs8s');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1zs8s" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1zs8s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A person who successfully committed suicide might be beyond the law's reach, but the dead person's corpse and property were not.

Evidence quickly amasses which point in Tony's direction, including his fingerprint found on the legs and a bite mark on one of the legs being an exact match to his teeth. Once Tony is thrown in jail, Abby throws herself into proving him innocent. She is finally able to trace the legs to a Jane Doe who died in a car accident, after which another plot becomes clear. Several years earlier, Tony had alerted authorities after a medical examiner had contaminated evidence which resulted in a convicted killer going free, and that same medical examiner was found to be in charge of the morgue where the unidentified young woman's body was found. The examiner is arrested, and Tony is released from jail and cleared of all charges. However, the storyline takes another turn when it is revealed that both Tony and the medical examiner had been targeted by none other than Charles, or Chip as commonly referred to, Abby's lab assistant. Apparently he had been working for the same lab as the medical examiner and it had actually been him all along who had contaminated the evidence from the past case, the discovery of which also clears the medical examiner. Charles reveals all this to Abby just as she is about to stumble upon evidence that will implicate him, after which he tries to attack her with a knife. Almost simultaneously, the team upstairs discovers Charles' connection to the case and realizing Abby is in danger, they race down to save her. They enter the lab, finding a struggle having taken place, but are relieved to find Abby unharmed and Charles hogtied in duct tape. The episode ends with Abby asking, "Now can I work alone?"

Huey, Dewey and Louie believe in his innocence, however, and ultimately uncover the proof that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it was really Flintheart Glomgold in an Uncle Scrooge costume</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> The very first Sideshow Bob episode had Bart trying to clear Krusty the Clown of committing armed robbery. Bob pulled it off with a very convincing disguise, but was foiled when Bart pointed out that the real culprit (Bob), unlike the real Krusty, had really big feet. Bob and Bart have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch Enemies</a> ever since.
</li><li> Bart himself was suspected of having Principal Skinner murdered by gangsters after Skinner's keeping him in detention prevented him from getting to work at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate">Fat Tony</a>'s club and caused Fat Tony a lot of trouble with a fellow crime boss. The mobsters do everything they can to make Bart look like the mastermind and make themselves look innocent, and it looks like Bart is going to go to jail until Skinner himself interrupts the trial and proves Bart's innocence. As it turns out, the reason Skinner disappeared was because he became trapped under a large pile of newspapers while cleaning out his garage. He was stuck for several days before he managed to free himself.
</li><li> And the episode where Mayor Quimby's nephew is accused of assaulting a waiter, and Bart witnesses the fact that he is innocent. Bart struggles with the fact that if he doesn't testify, an innocent (if still a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>) man will go to prison, but if he does testify, he'll be confessing that he was truant from school at the time in question.

When Mr. Anybody comes downstairs after hearing the racket and sees Kevin with the piece of the broken watch band in his mouth, he assumes that Kevin stole his watch, calls him a bad dog, then takes him outside as punishment. Bogus then works hard to see if he can solve the mystery and prove Kevin's innocence. The next night, when the thief returns, Bogus sics Kevin on the thief, who, this time, fails in trying to escape as Kevin catches him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After the thief is unmasked, he is actually revealed to be Ratty in disguise the whole time. When Mr. Anybody shows up again and sees that Kevin caught Ratty and got the watch back, he realizes that it was actually Ratty who stole the watch, thereby vindicating Kevin.</span>
