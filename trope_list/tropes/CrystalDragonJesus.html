Often there will be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> analog and/or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a> analog but not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a> one, although this is somewhat excusable as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodInHumanForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodInHumanForm">Jesus himself is also God</a> according to the precept of the Trinity.
</p><p>In numerous cases, in order to finalize the separation, the deity worshipped <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineRaceLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineRaceLift">is a goddess</a>. In these cases, she is usually just called "the Goddess." (This may be based off the common use by neo-pagan religions of this term to denote the main female deity.)

Western productions typically don't engage in this trope since they have to worry about offending someone; however, they may use Crystal Dragon Jesus as a satire on Christianity, in which case the offense is intended. They may also use it simply to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges">Middle Ages</a> tropes without having to deal with Christianity directly. Also if one wants to use a religion that most people get the gist of, but want the setting to take place in a different world that isn't directly Earth (and thus it wouldn't make sense for the real Christianity, or any other of the Earth religions to exist), this trope is useful. For some, Crystal Dragon Jesus can be interpreted as a certain universe's projection of the omnipresent God Himself, if done right.

Turns out Eneru is just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoElectro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoElectro">out of his gourd</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>: The sun-worshipping false religion practiced by Father Cornello incorporates many aspects of Roman Catholicism. Later in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">2003 anime</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rose</span> (who has a young baby) begins wearing a veil and is worshipped as the "Holy Mother", similarly to the Virgin Mary. This is especially noteworthy because, in later episodes of the 2003 anime version, it is revealed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that Christianity itself is a <em>dead</em> religion; the show implies the timelines of the fictional universe and "our" universe split about a millennium in the past, around the time alchemy was discovered</span>. This doesn't apply to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">the manga</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em>:
<ul><li> There is a character, Wolfwood, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodShepherd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodShepherd">who certainly dresses the way we'd expect a Protestant pastor to dress, and he does things like listen to confessions.</a> There is a fair amount of analysis of the conflict between pacifist ideals and the obligation he feels to protect the innocent even if he must kill in order to do so. The major departure is the standard ludicrous weapon given to most characters; in Wolfwood's case, a portable pistol armory in the shape of a <em>7-foot tall cross</em> (which also has a rocket launcher and machine gun built into it), which he jokes is heavy because it's "full of mercy".
</li><li> In the anime version, it's revealed that the various Christian/Protestant trappings are more a disguise/mockery than anything else, as Wolfwood is intended to be the next <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Chapel of the Church of the Gung-ho Guns, implicitly a cult religion created by Knives for the purpose of paying homage to him. Given this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Knives</a> we're talking about, it wouldn't be that out of character.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The church of Mauser in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ScrappedPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ScrappedPrincess">Scrapped Princess</a></em> has many of the Christian trappings, with a fair amount of local color.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/RecordOfLodossWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/RecordOfLodossWar">Record of Lodoss War</a></em>, the archetypal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy">High Fantasy</a> anime, priests and paladins can be seen wearing crosses on their vestments/armor — even if they worship separate gods.
</li><li> The loosely-connected spinoff <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RuneSoldierLouie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RuneSoldierLouie">Rune Soldier Louie</a></em> heavily features the Church of Mylee, which closely resembles a crusader order, except that it's exclusively female. (Male priests of Mylee play an important part in Lodoss War as well, it's possible that there are separate orders for men and women, though there is no rule of celibacy.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThoseWhoHuntElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThoseWhoHuntElves">Those Who Hunt Elves</a>,</em> the holy symbol of Elvish priests looks an awful lot like a Greek Orthodox cross. There are also at least a few small, rather Christian-esque churches (including stained glass windows!) which may have only a single Roman Catholic-ish-looking priest and/or nun as staff, though the holy symbol seems to be more of a capital X in a circle for these. As of episode 9, there's not a whole lot of theology being discussed, though.
</li><li> The Saint Church of Ancient Belka in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em> even has Jesus and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudOfTurin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudOfTurin">Shroud of Turin</a> analogues. Some of the reformed S3 villains end up joining the Church. Nanoha adopts a clone of their Jesus figure (Vivio) as her daughter. For their part, the Saint Church officially considers Vivio a "descendant of the Saint King", rather than a reincarnation or a Second Coming, and do not worship her (though they do refer to her as "Your Majesty").
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Holy See religious order is a full on Catholic Church approximation, complete with the Pope, bishops, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Inquisition</span>. It is also strongly hinted at that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they actually worship the Godhand instead of the Four Elemental Kings, with shots of branded skeletons and Mozgus' story suggesting that the dungeon-cum-inquisition tower was rebuilt as an homage to Void's rise to the Godhand, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope">The Pope</a> recognizing Griffith as the "Risen Savior"</span>.
</li><li> Chapter 83, the so-called "Lost Chapter," was never reprinted at the author's request because it supposedly gave too much of the story away too quickly. If you accept it as canon, you'll see that the symbol used by the Holy See wherever you would normally see a cross or crucifix in Catholicism is actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a stylized representation of the Idea of Evil, also known as the God of the Abyss and the "ungodly god born of man", a powerful creation of mankind's collective unconscious whose sole purpose is to cause pain and suffering so that humanity has someone else to blame for their problems.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em>, there's a literal dragon-worshiping church with suspiciously cross-like sunburst symbols and temples that tend to look rather Catholic. Their god Ceiphed sacrificed himself to save the world, too, and left behind four elemental dragon gods. Large factions of the church tend to have extremist policies about what's right in saving the world.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HauntedJunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HauntedJunction">Haunted Junction</a></em>, Haruto Hojo is selected to be one of the three members of the Holy Student Council (the others being a Shinto miko and the son of a Buddhist monk) because his father is a Christian priest. The denomination is <em>extremely</em> vague... the priest's vestments are similar to a Jesuit's robes but in all white, he can marry and have a family, has the icons in his church that bear a strong resemblance to the Virgin Mary, and is skilled in the ways of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HermeticMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HermeticMagic">Hermetic Magic</a> with no qualms about teaching his son enough to make a spirit trapping spell. (Note that some rites in the Catholic Church allow priests to marry; just not the Latin rite, which is the largest.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZeroSevenGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZeroSevenGhost">07-Ghost</a></em>, the Church is identical to the Roman Catholic church (pre-schisms), right down to its relationship with the secular government, except that in addition to God, they worship seven 'ghosts' that are more like crosses between saints and <em>angels</em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SpaceAdventureCobra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SpaceAdventureCobra">Space Adventure Cobra</a></em>: The signature character (Cobra himself) goes to church to pray for the life of a badly wounded ally. He delivers a rather half-assed personal talk with God, professes that it's completely out of his character and ends by telling the holy image that he leaves the rest up to him (God), since He is clearly more qualified in the whole causing miracles department. What makes it qualify for this trope in a somewhat hilarious fashion is that the obviously Christian crucifix is mounted upside-down.
</li><li> The world of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymore</a></em> has a dominate religious order that resembles Catholicism, with priests, nuns, and even an entire holy city called Rabona, which forbids the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">Amazon Brigade</a> from entering since they are half demon, though it doesn't stop the actual full-blooded demons from entering the city.
</li><li> The Church in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SpiceAndWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SpiceAndWolf">Spice and Wolf</a></em> is heavily reminiscent of pre-Reformation Catholicism, complete with indulgences.

</li><li> The Church in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero">The Familiar of Zero</a></em> is pretty much the Middle Ages Catholic Church complete with a Pope (residing in Romalia) and Christ-figure (Brimnir).

</li><li> Beyond the Walls there's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the cult of Ymir, the Progenitor/Original Titan and Patron-Saint of the Eldian people; Ymir herself, like Andraste from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em> mentioned below, seems to be a combination of a female Jesus with Joan of Arc with the ability to turn into a Titan to boot. Interestingly, for the Eldians she is revered as a goddess-savior, while for the Marleyans she is portrayed as a devil, in the opinion of Eren Kruger the truth must be somewhere in between</span>.

<ul><li> The Church of Tal held an inquisition against magic and were, perhaps, the single most cohesive political entity in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArc">the story arc</a> covered by <em>The Dark</em>.

</li><li> Serra is also a Crystal Dragon Jesus, as a planeswalker. Serra is first introduced via Serra Angel. <em>Homelands</em> gives us Serra Inquisitors. But the big point for Serra is <em>Urza's Saga</em>, with cards like Worship, Pariah, and a buttload of angels for Serra. The <em>Urza's Saga</em> editions of plains are all from Serra's Realm, and they feature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyCloudHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyCloudHeaven">floating continents</a>. Storyline-wise, Serra's Realm is attacked by Phyrexians (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> for hell), leading to Planar Collapse. A year later, the flavor text for Copper-Leaf Angel says "When Serra made angels, people called her a goddess. My angels are superior to hers." (Unless it's late in the game and you've got land to spare, they aren't). This only became more intense in the return to Dominaria set, where serran forces put church stained glass on <em>everything</em> from armor to weapons and celebrate her as a saviour figure.
</li><li> Avacyn from the <em>Innistrad</em> block is a curious example. Her church is clearly modeled after medieval Christianity, but the dogma is vastly different (for starters, afterlife is a blessed sleep, and both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent">angels</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">demons</a> are physical beings rather than otherworldly ones), and Avacyn herself is mankind's savior in a more direct sense, since she kills the monsters. In addition, she is essentially a moon goddess, like the Greek Selene. And a goth.
</li><li> The polytheistic settings of Theros and Amonkhet are based off historical Greek and Egyptian religions, respectively.
</li><li> The Legion of Dusk in Ixalan is based off Catholicism, as to be expected from conquistador analogues. The twist being that they are also <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligiousVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligiousVampire">vampires</a></em>; in particular, their tradition of Blood Fasts, holding off blood consumption for a while, is reminiscent of Lent and similar traditions. The Sun Empire from the same setting is based off Aztec sun-worship, but it is fairly unique in being a form of monotheism in which the sun is perceived in three distinct aspects (distinctively separated from Trinity theology by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>), which if anything is more similar to Egyptian perceptions on Khepri, Ra and Atum.
</li><li> The Orzhov from Ravnica are aesthetically based on the roman catholic church and follow a similar clerical hierarchy. Naturally, they play up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch">Corrupt Church</a> angle for all its worth, being scammers of the highest order that bind their devotees into servitude. Their theology is deliberately kept vague, though it is heavily implied to be ancestor worship, and at any rate they don't deny the religious legitimacy of other religious groups like the Selesnya (aside from pointing out that they're hippies).

</li><li> The theological framework in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKaturranOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKaturranOdyssey">The Katurran Odyssey</a></em> by David Michael Wiegeris is pretty straightforwardly pseudo-Christian: the Fossah is basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia">Aslan</a> as a, well, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossa_(animal)">fossa<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and is worshiped by the lemurs as their single "lord of light and dark". Katook is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChosenOne">Chosen One</a>, and redeems his people's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch">Corrupt Church</a>. There is an indication that other gods were worshiped in this world, but the story makes no claim to disclaim the apparent monotheism, and all magic that does not come directly from the Fossah is evidently fake.
</li><li> Thorarinn Gunnarsson's "Dragonlord of Mystara" includes one of the few literal examples: the protagonist grows up as a human orphan, but is secretly <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a polymorphed gold dragon, son of the only dragon god and his chief cleric. In book 2, the crystal dragons of D&amp;D are described as</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranshumanTreachery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranshumanTreachery">transdragonists</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who enhanced themselves magically and tried to conquer the word; they had been trying to achieve</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">godhood</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">; in book 3, the protagonist - once again, the literal son of a god - apotheoses into a crystal dragon to save all mortal life from a soul-enslaving alien evil.</span> However, in spite of there being a <em>literal</em> crystal dragon Jesus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">expy</a> involved, it subverts every other defining aspect of the trope.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a>'' series by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>:
<ul><li> The Discworld contains demons of various descriptions, in the earlier books they might be regarded as Crystal Dragon Jesus version of Dantes Inferno (<em>Faust/Eric</em>).
</li><li> Omnianism is more of a <em>parody</em> of aspects of Christianity, but does worship Om as a bull or an eagle (or, later, a tortoise). Later on Omnians use an image of the prophet Brutha strapped to a torture device (an iron turtle that was filled with flame) in place of a crucifix. More obliquely, in the novel <em>Feet of Clay</em>, Pratchett writes about a conflicting dead religion from the same region as Omnianism, which, given the fact that its "priests" make Golems, might be the Crystal Dragon Jesus version of Judaism. Omnians in later books have also picked up similar habits to Jehovah's Witnesses and the Salvation Army. Note that "Omnianism" could mean "Everythingism" (Latin, <em>omnia</em>) and the name of the Great God could be a back formation. So what? Well, since "catholic" means "universal", "catholicism" might be parsed as "everythingism" too.
</li><li> Omnianism parodies different aspects of evangelical Christianity, specifically; in <em>Small Gods</em>, which (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">possibly</a>) takes place some considerable time before the rest of the series, it's very much parallel to the Crusades, being inclined to spread the good word by the sword and dealing rather harshly with heretics (and occasionally taking incredibly liberal definitions of "heresy"). Omnians who are chronologically post-<em>Small Gods</em> are much less violent, and superficially resemble Jehovah's Witnesses; the City Watch books frequently mention that Constable "Washpot" Visit-The-Ungodly-With-Explanatory-Pamphlets spends all his off hours trooping door-to-door through Ankh-Morpork trying to win converts.
</li><li> The transition between the two states, changing from a singular evangelical state with autocratic rule to a constantly-schisming hodgepodge of different sects who all disagree on minor points of dogma and decorum, approximately references the breakoff of Protestant Christianity from Catholicism and its aftermath. On the Discworld, however, the expected centuries of persecution and religious civil war were prevented thanks to the reasonable approach of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">Brutha</a> and the meddling of a time-traveler.
</li><li> Interestingly, although the series' Klatchians are clearly Arabs, they are not explicitly linked with Islam other than through a few throwaway references to houris. This is because "Klatch" is both a country (that's half the mythical Araby and half the modern Middle East) and a continent which is basically a stand-in for Asia. The polytheistic religion of Klatch-the-country, complete with temples covered in erotic carvings, is closer to a Crystal Dragon Jesus version of Hinduism. The Klatchians, especially in earlier books, correspond more to old portrayals of Araby, where the religion was something that encompassed paganism, satanism and (sometimes) the beliefs of pre-Islamic Arabs (these were usually made from the point of view that the Crusaders were absolutely right, of course).
</li><li> And the History Monks are Crystal Dragon Buddhism.
</li><li> The church of Blind Io (a sort of Odin/Zeus expy) fills the spot of Church of England as the religion most pay lip service to, but no one gets all that excited about, including the priests. Illustrations of Hugonon Ridcully (Chief Priest of Blind Io in Ahnk-Morpork) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastHero">The Last Hero</a></em> depict him in vestments that look very Bishop-y, and include plenty of crosses (which is especially odd as his god's symbol is a hammer).
</li><li> Offlerism (despite Offler being a crocodile god who fits thematically with Egyptian gods) has some elements of Christianity, such as showing one temple having a collection for fixing the roof, a common phenomenon in old English churches, but the religion also has elements of Islam. It's particularly common in some parts of Klatch, and there's a throwaway reference to devout Offlerians avoiding alcohol. Riffing on Muslim and Jewish dietary laws, Offler forbids his followers from eating broccoli — which is easy to follow, since no-one wants to eat broccoli anyway.
</li><li> There is also a rather tongue-in-cheek practice of offering sacrifice to Offler in the form of frying sausages (this is ALSO a very English joke, referring to the traditional Punch and Judy show, in which a crocodile steals a string of sausages). The priests fry the sausages, by which the essence of sausagidity ascends to Offler; this achieved, they EAT the sausages, claiming that the empty husks... turn to ashes in their mouths.
</li><li> The deity Nuggan is basically intended to represent all that can be bad about a religion, and is an egomaniac who constantly imposes new prohibitions on his followers/declares new things to be abominations (in contrast to Offler, he prohibits things people would actually want to do). Nugganism was the state religion of Borogravia, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania">Ruritania</a> with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalMorons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalMorons">Medieval Morons</a> feel, although some readers have interpreted Borogravia under Nuggan is comparable to Afghanistan under the Taliban. Among Nuggan's abominations are <em>chocolate and garlic.</em> A later book in the series seems to suggest Nuggan is now a small god, or a wisp of divine essence with little power or consciousness due to lack of worshipers. It's not that there are no Nugganites, but that their faith is now centered on the abominations rather than the god; it's likely he hasn't actually issued any of the recent abominations.
</li><li> An older religion still, which still appears to have adherents in modern Ankh-Morpork, is the Cenotine faith. This is the one part of the theocratic set-up that preserves the secret of making <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Golem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Golem">Golems</a></em> and which uses a script not unlike the Hebrew alphabet. Elsewhere it is hinted that Cenotism is a parent faith of Omnianism, or at least closely related. And Ankh-Morpork is expressly described as having <em>kosher butchers</em>. So <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveToHaveJews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveToHaveJews">somebody must follow kashrut dietary law</a>, or something like it...
</li></ul></li><li> Fiona Patton's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfTheBranionRealm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfTheBranionRealm">Tales of the Branion Realm</a></em> historical fantasy series, set in an alternate Europe in like manner to Guy Gavriel Kay's works, has two fictional faiths which very loosely parallel the conflict between Catholicism and Protestantism and have many deliberate similarities to Christianity:
<ul><li> The Triarctic faith worships the Living Flame, which is literally present in the body of a human avatar who doubles as the alternate Britain's monarch. It also worships the Holy Triarchy, the minor aspects of Wind, Sea and Oaks. There is a sign of the Triarchy drawn across the breast by worshipers. One of the prayers is Sabbat Mass.
</li><li> Essussiatism is a faith centered on a Pontiff, who lives in Tiberia (the equivalent of Italy). It also has abbots, saints, churches and crusades. The alternate France and Spain are staunchly Essussiate, although Fenland (the Lowlands) is Reformist. There are numbered Tenets of Essus.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSevenRealmsSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSevenRealmsSeries">The Seven Realms Series</a></em> gives us the Church of Mathus, which forbids the use of magic and considers wizards to be heretics, and two briefly mentioned beings known as the Maker and the Breaker. However, the Church doesn't generally play a major role in the series. They're essentially the by-product of ill-will towards wizards brought about by the Demon King, a wizard that nearly destroyed the world a thousand years before the start of the series.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WaxAndWayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WaxAndWayne">Wax and Wayne</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrandonSanderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrandonSanderson">Brandon Sanderson</a>:
<ul><li> Survivorism has some pretty clear parallels to Christianity. It worships a messianic figure who died and (apparently) rose again, and it's symbol is the object that killed their savior, Kelsier (a spear instead of a cross). However, in this case it is a deconstruction of this trope, as the prequel trilogy shows that Survivorism's savior was simply a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">Guile Hero</a> who planned his own death, used it to establish a religion in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit">Thanatos Gambit</a>, where he hoped that by dying and faking his return, he could help to defeat an evil tyrant. What he didn't realize was that his religion might last for centuries.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MistbornSecretHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MistbornSecretHistory">Mistborn: Secret History</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BandsOfMourning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BandsOfMourning">Bands of Mourning</a></em> reveal that it's even closer <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">since Kelsier did, in fact, survive and gain divine power with the aid of another benevolent god</span>. To be fair, even Kelsier didn't see that part coming. The Author's interpretation also adds a Mormon twist <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kelsier left to another continent to teach the people there</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BandsOfMourning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BandsOfMourning">Bands of Mourning</a></em>, we see a Survivorist wedding, and it becomes clear it's no exception. They have pendants instead of rings, girls spreading ash instead of flowers, and the guests are segregated into bride and groom sections. Even their wedding clothes are very similar, though there doesn't appear to be any superstition about seeing the bride before the ceremony.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemorySorrowAndThorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemorySorrowAndThorn">Memory, Sorrow and Thorn</a></em> novels by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TadWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TadWilliams">Tad Williams</a>, in which the religion of Usires Aedon is clearly Christianity with the proper names search-and-replaced (he was the avatar of God, he died nailed to a tree and arose, etc.), in keeping with the books' setting of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Fantasy Counterpart Culture</a> version of Medieval Europe.
</li><li> In Lindsay Buroker's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FallenEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FallenEmpire">Fallen Empire</a></em> series, the dominant faith of the Tribus Solis System is the worship of the Suns Trinity, which includes robed monks and ten commandments.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NoGodsOnlyDaimons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NoGodsOnlyDaimons">No Gods, Only Daimons</a></em> by Kai Wai Cheah contains thinly-disguised versions of both Christianity and Islam. Their respective cultures are... not getting along at the moment.
</li><li> An interesting version in <em>In High Places</em>, one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove">Harry Turtledove</a> 's Crosstime Traffic books, where the religion is an alternate universe version of Christianity. In the alternate universe the Black Death lasted longer, and in the aftermath Christians began worshiping Henri, God's Second Son. Just like with Jesus, Henri's followers use the device that killed him as their symbol (a wheel, as Henri was stretched on a large wooden wheel and rolled down a hill, crushing him).
<ul><li> In his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Videssos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Videssos">Videssos</a></em> which features a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Fantasy Counterpart Culture</a> version of Byzantine history, Turtledove excels in creating an in-depth fantasy version of Medieval Eastern Orthodox Christianity, along with multiple heresies that are pretty much just people going to war over the small print. Later in the prequels, he creates a Crystal Dragon Zoroaster for his fantasy version of the Persians.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a> series:
<ul><li> The Faith of the Seven is modeled after Roman Catholicism, except they worship the seven aspects known as the Father, Mother, Warrior, Maid, Smith, Crone, and Stranger. The faith has monastic orders, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">dormant military orders</a>, Cardinals (the Most Devout) and a Pope (the High Septon). It's the dominant religion of the Seven Kingdoms, supplanting the pagan religion of the "old gods", much like Christianity did throughout Europe, the difference being that worship of the old gods is still permitted (and still prevails in the Kingdom of the North) and several oaths refer to "the old gods and the new". The Faith is also the only religion invested in chivalry and knightly traditions.
</li><li> The faith of the Drowned God in the Iron Islands is very much akin to Christianity in different ways than the Faith of the Seven, being based around a god who died and came back to life, with the most important ritual being immersion in water (literal drowning and resuscitation, at least for those entering the priesthood). It's a strictly monotheistic religion that features a Satan-like adversary called the Storm God, with a dash of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos">Cthulhu Mythos</a> added for extra creepiness, and the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Viking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Viking">Viking</a> customs of raiding everyone else traditionally.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune">Dune</a></em> and sequels by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankHerbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankHerbert">Frank Herbert</a>:
<ul><li> Located in a distant future of our own universe, the Orange Catholic (generally referred to as the OC) is an echo of what used to be Christianity. The O.C. Bible was a conglomeration of various historical religious texts, created in order to end religious disputes.
</li><li> Paul would seem to be the Fremen's Crystal Dragon Muhammed... which is all the Bene Gesserit's fault for grafting their Kwizatz Haderach bits onto the Zensunni religion. Then he becomes everybody else's Crystal Dragon Muhammed via jihad.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Inverted</em> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>'s book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em>. Eru (God) has a lot of similarities to the Christian deity (as to be expected from a Catholic author), but the way in which his creations worship him is very different from traditional Christian practice-if you want to technical about it, he <strong>is</strong> the Christian deity. There are very few ceremonies, only a couple per year. And worship is never carried out in buildings; indeed, temples and churches are associated with evil by worshipers of Eru. In Númenórean worship, only the King or Queen could speak to Eru directly and make (bloodless) offerings, and most prayers or hymns seen in the mythology are addressed to one of the Valar (who roughly correspond to archangels or pagan gods). With them, there is something of a hierarchy of Crystal-Dragon Angels and saints, in a rather Catholic way. And only few mortals having the line to god and the majority having to go through them is quite a Catholic understanding of prayer.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis">C. S. Lewis</a>:
<ul><li> Averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia">The Chronicles of Narnia</a></em>. Aslan literally <em>is</em> Jesus. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> (unavoidable pun) is that just as God the Son became incarnate as Jesus in our world, so he became incarnate as Aslan in Narnia. In one book the characters ask Aslan how they can continue to believe in him if he doesn't exist in their own world, but Aslan replies that he does, under a different name. This also means that the "Emperor Beyond the Sea", mentioned to be Aslan's father, would be God the Father. Tash, on the other hand, clearly represents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a>, with Shift as the false prophet and Puzzle the (unwitting) Antichrist. Aslan's Country, of course, would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heaven">Heaven</a>, and is further based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Plato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Plato">Plato</a>'s ideas of it being more real than our world (or Narnia, here), which Lewis liked.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSpaceTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSpaceTrilogy">The Space Trilogy</a></em> averts this in a similar way. The protagonist initially thinks "Oyarsa" is the name of the Martians' pagan god; as the first book progresses, he comes to understand that it's the title of the spiritual being that governs Mars, under the authority of God, called "Maleldil" in the Martian language. The second book contains a reference to both "Maleldil" and "Maleldil the Young", presumably God the Father and God the Son.)

It's even got inquisitors, known as "Viral Cleansers", and heretics for them to hunt.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NickPerumov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NickPerumov">Nick Perumov</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KeeperOfTheSwords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KeeperOfTheSwords">Keeper of the Swords</a></em> series of fantasy novels, there is an evil Crystal Dragon Jesus called "The Saviour", who resembles actual Jesus very much. Creepy.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertJordan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertJordan">Robert Jordan</a>:
<ul><li> The organization of the Aes Sedai is pretty much a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">gender flipped</a> version of the Catholic Church, with novices, habits (white dresses and shawls), solemn oaths, a Pope expy complete with Great Schism, and various claims of working in the name of the Creator. There's little hint aside from all this of an organized religion however, with houses of worship, prayers or even doctrines absent.
</li><li> The Children of the Light, on the other hand, resemble both the Knights Templar and the Inquisition.
</li><li> And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructiveSavior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructiveSavior">Rand himself</a> is born to a Maiden (though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoManOfWomanBorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoManOfWomanBorn">not a virgin</a>), suffers wounds to his palms, takes a wound in the side from a staff (according to Tarot symbolism, iconographically the same as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLanceOfLonginus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLanceOfLonginus">the Spear of Longinus</a>), and is crowned king with the Crown of Swords aka the Laurel Crown (plants + sharp points = crown of thorns).

The two disciples of the long-dead wizard Juvens have a running feud that has shaped most of the contemporary world. Bayaz built the secular Union as his proxy, while Khalul used his magic to craft the theocracy of Gerkhul, with him as its everlasting Prophet. Khalul and his religion bear many striking similarities to Islam, particularly in roughly Crusades era that the setting exists in.

It gets even more confusing, though. Belief in the Jaddite Christ figure, named Heladikos, is actually a <em>heresy</em> of Jaddism, being the rough fantasy counterpart of Arianism. Heladikos's story resembles that of Phaeton, the son of the Greek sun god Helios, who lost control of the chariot of the sun. Jad is more of a conflation of Helios and Jehovah, then, instead of a direct Christian analogue (and maybe some Apollo, too). Off to the side, you also have the Kindath (Jews) who worship the moons, and the Asharites (Muslims) who worship the stars. Everyone thinks everyone else's choice of veneration is insane, for various reasons. And unlike the real world Abrahamic faiths that share some stories, prophets, etc; there doesn't seem to be any common basis between Jaddites, Asharites, and Kindath.

This time, he gets Mary and Joseph to adopt the one baby to survive the massacre. He becomes the Redeemer (no name is ever given) with the power to put any object or living being into another dimension (apparently, Hell). The resulting religion shares much with Christianity but has differences as well. For example, there's no Devil, and to speak of him is heresy of the highest kind. Hell is a frozen wasteland (making the well-known phrase irrelevant). The symbol of the Churches (there are two with one leader) is the Holy Pillar, to which the Redeemer tied himself before disappearing. There are bishops, monks, priests, cardinals, paladins, nuns, large cathedrals, holy wars, etc. Vatican is called Urbis for some reason. Judas was the only loyal disciple of the original twelve. Murder is not a sin unless done more than twelve times (except if involving children and the elderly). Mary is hardly ever mentioned; instead, the adopted Sister of the Redeemer is as revered as him. The Antichrist is scheduled to appear before the Second Coming of the Redeemer, except he is called the Tempter.

The church in question has many of the trappings of Medieval Christianity — worship of a "Sacrificed God", monks and nuns, soaring cathedrals, rampant corruption with some good eggs. Specifically believers under duress whip out a "Sign of the Flame," presumably analogous to the Christian "Sign of the Cross."

At least according to the Tehlin church, who we can be pretty sure are mostly wrong. We are led to believe that Tehlu does exist, but is probably something completely different. That doesn't stop the church from wearing iron wheels like crosses, arresting people for heresy, having a mysterious secret society of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKnightsTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKnightsTemplar">The Knights Templar</a>, and holding a midwinter festival that is sort of like a cross between Christmas and Halloween.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFoldingKnife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFoldingKnife">The Folding Knife</a></em>, it is indicated that worshipers will carry a rosary that includes beads and jewelry representing "Lady Moon [perhaps a Virgin Mary analog], seven silver stars and the Invincible Sun".

The prophet Inrithi shook up the pre-existing religion much like a Jesus figure, and he is worshiped as holy. Inrithi people are at war with a rival, more fiercely monotheistic and desert-dwelling religion obviously analogous to Islam. During the story, the main character pretends to be the messiah of the Inrithi while on a crusade against the religion's rivals. He becomes their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">Messianic Archetype</a> when the Inrithi lords attempt to execute him by "circumfixion," but he survives, and his image on the "circumfix" (a circle instead of a cross) becomes the symbol of his movement.

</li><li> David Weber's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Safehold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Safehold">Safehold</a></em> series features the Church of God Awaiting, a technophobic world church which is so prevalent that the concept of atheism literally doesn't exist in the planetary society. Played with in that the audience knows from the start that the teachings and holy scripture are all lies, deliberately crafted by members of the colonization mission in order to prevent the population from advancing to the point that they might be noticed by the aliens that destroyed the rest of humanity. The protagonist's mission is to break the Church's power and reveal the truth, leading to the beginning of the first-ever schism in the thousand-year history of Safehold in the second novel.

Good warriors go to StarClan while warriors that break the Warrior Code go to the Dark Forest. Medicine cats are both Clan healers and religious leaders. Medicine cats are not allowed to take mates, have kits, or fight (though at least one medicine cat has a family because he became a medicine cat later in life than usual).

It's the main religion in Oz and has supplanted the traditionan pagan worship of the fairy goddess Lurline (Lurlinism). Unionists worship the Unnamed God and their religious text is the Oziad. Elphaba's father Frexspar is a minister and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist">fundamentalist</a> sister Nessarose later becomes a sort-of faith healer.

There are a few differences from Christianity, such as Unionists being less conservative about sex (for example, Frex is bisexual and was in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Polyamory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Polyamory">triad</a> with his wife when she was alive).
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall">Redwall</a></em> series by Brian Jacques, the Redwallers have Martin the Warrior, a figure in Redwall's history. In the books, he is depicted as a saint (appearing in visions or dreams which provide guidance, etc.) while the TV series flip-flops between depicting him as either a saint (he appears in visions as with the books) or as close to a god as he could be (the characters ask Martin for help, in and in the Season 3 premiere the Redwallers sing a song thanking him for the season's harvest). Redwall itself is a Catholic-like abbey with monks and nuns, and aside from this however there's no explicit religion, with only a vague "Dark Forest" as the afterlife. The Devil is mentioned in the first book, but religious references are made progressively less frequent. Vulpuz is mentioned in <em>The Taggerung</em>, who seems to be a Satan-like being (it was said he rules Hellgates and created the foxes) though it only comes up once.

The Church is more powerful than the secular king and maintains a holy order of paladins, and even has a Pope—with the absurd name of Godot Deus—who was responsible for placing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Geas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Geas">geas</a> on Elisabeth (the eponymous Torture Princess).

There's even a curse used, "God's noose", matching our world's "God's wounds", or "zounds". The physical prayer motion is a circular hand movement evocative of a looped noose, instead of crossing themselves in the shape of a crucifix. The monks in the orphanage even wear a rope tied into a noose around their necks instead of a crucifix. Curiously, in one episode a Pact soldier is still shown crossing himself before injecting himself with the werewolf serum, implying that they have a more explicit Christian counterpart.

<ul><li> The Faith of the Seven, the official religion of Westeros, is reminiscent of the Catholic Church. In addition to supplanting the pagan religion of the "old gods", the Faith worships a single god with seven aspects similar to the Holy Trinity and has a hierarchy of celibate clergy including septons (priests/monks) and septas (nuns), begging brothers (friars), and elite of Most Devout (cardinals), and a single High Septon (pope) at the top. Membership, or at least lip service, is mandatory to become a knight. However, the Faith is much more subservient to the crown than the Church was in most of medieval Europe. With few exceptions, the religion is rare in both the North and the Iron Islands; the former still follows pagan rituals of the Old Gods and the latter worships "the Drowned God."
</li><li> Mirri Maz Duur mentions the religion of the Lhazareen, in which all men are one flock, watched over by the Great Shepherd. This makes them reluctant to fight others, and easy pickings for Dothraki raids, resembling pacifist Christians.

First of all, the Three (a trio of people-two male, one female) are believed to be holy, and wear robes very similar to the ones Catholic bishops have, along with miters. They have many powers, including an ability to raise the dead. Not only that, but they even appear to have a cross symbol (although it may just be the design of the window slits in one room). Given they are villains, the darker side is also present-they conduct purges of Blackbloods (whom they believe to be inherently evil) plus people who know a language they use, since it might cast doubt upon their teaching. Also, the sect appears to have Inquisition-like members, plus having strict bans on drinking, gambling or extramarital sex, as some conservative Christians have enforced.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>:
<ul><li> Origin is, like the rest of the villains in it, a dark alien parody of an Earth religion, in this case, the conservative fundamentalist Christianity, with a few touches of Mormonism. Not only do they have their own priests and missionaries, they have their own Jesus figure (Adria) and a distinctly King James-styled holy book. The only difference: the religion's "gods" are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Sufficiently Advanced Alien</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings">Energy Beings</a> with a fire-and-brimstone motif. Notably, though, the main characters are quick to bring up the similarities. Mitchell, in particular, often compares the Priors and their preaching to his Bible-thumping grandmother. On the other hand, in one episode, they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JesusTaboo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JesusTaboo">oddly hesitant</a> to liken Vala's pregnancy to that of Mary's, instead comparing it to the births of King Arthur and Darth Vader. This particular case may be at least partly attributed to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>. Everyone <em>expects</em> the cast to point out Jesus (especially with the aforementioned parallels between Origin and fundamentalist Christianity), so it's funnier when Teal'c answers with Darth Vader (a callback to Teal'c having watched <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> nine times since coming to Earth) instead. If you watch the rest of the cast's faces, it's clearly unexpected to them, too. As well, Mitchell suggesting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">King Arthur</a> is probably partly influenced by the fact that the legend of King Arthur got them into the whole Ori mess in the first place, so it would be on his mind. Carter's reaction to Mitchell clearly show she was about to say Jesus herself. This is compounded by the fact that Mitchell has repeatedly mentioned how often he went to church with his grandma as a kid.
<div class="indent"><strong>Vala:</strong> <em>[about her spontaneous pregnancy]</em> Have you ever heard of anything like that? <em>[the rest of the team looks around hesitantly]</em> <br/><strong>Teal'c:</strong> Darth Vader. <br/><strong>Vala:</strong> Really?

</div></li><li> Mind you that Daniel also mentions how the Ancients, the good, shiny, all in white heaven like counterpart to the Ori (and creators of Humanity) changed human outlook from Fire = Good to Fire = Bad. Essentially, the Ancients showed themselves as God/Angels in shiny white armor, and depicted the Ori as the Devil/Demons with fire and brimstone hell.
</li><li> The show tended to shy away from making ANY connection to modern religion in the first few seasons. The first "gods" were either ancient Egyptian (Ra, Apophis, Seth, Heru'ur, Hathor), Greek (Chronos) or Norse (Thor). As more system lords were introduced, this rule began to waver, such as with the introduction of a Goa'uld masquerading as Satan — and they even tried to give that one trappings of Egyptian myth (with of course, the completely wrong Goa'uld). Later we even got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Taoism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Taoism">Yu the Jade Emperor</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Shinto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Shinto">Amatherasu</a>, but Abrahamic religions remained mostly absent.

They also have demon like figures, the Pah-Wraiths, who were cast out of the Celestial Temple. There's also a council of cardinals, the Vedek Assembly, who elect a pope, the Kai, from among their own number.

</li><li> The polytheistic religions of the various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> settings usually have a lawful good deity whose religion is a direct parallel of Christianity. In particular, the church of Paladine (an almost literal Crystal Dragon Jesus who takes the form of a platinum dragon) in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em> setting has many direct parallels to Roman Catholicism, including having formerly wielded an incredible amount of political power, and having had an inquisition-like purge against wizards, non-humans, and worshipers of non-Good deities (or, more accurately, non-Paladine deities). Of course, said inquisition was rather on the extreme side, and lead directly to the "departure" of the Gods in the Cataclysm, where they "dropped a mountain on the city of Istar". The Gods themselves spent quite a bit of time attempting to avoid such things. Also notable is that Paladine is Dragonlance's direct parallel to the ubiquitous dragon deity Bahamut, also a Platinum Dragon Jesus, who also takes Tyr's place in post Spellplague <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a>.
<ul><li> Despite each setting having what is described as a pantheon, in many of them the idea of actual polytheism (worshipping more than one god) is treated as eccentric and indecisive at best, or blasphemous at worst. The default assumption seems to be some form of henotheism (believing in all gods of the setting, but worshipping only one) - if a worshipper of the god of fire is about to set off on a dangerous sea voyage, he either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer">prays to the god of fire to calm the sea</a>, or asks a follower of the sea god to pray for him.
</li><li> Setting-specific religions aside, plenty of early D&amp;D products' artwork depicted clerics or paladins using crosses as holy symbols, or as insignia on their shields. Yes, even in comic strips where the same characters call upon "the gods" for aid in battle.
</li><li> D&amp;D in general, especially the earlier editions, practically codified this trope. It's explicitly stated the Cleric class was based on militant medieval Catholic orders, and many of the cleric's spells were based on the miracles of Jesus and the prophets and apostles from the Old and New Testaments, but the gods of the setting materials were always a mish-mash of real-world and fictional polytheist pantheons.
</li><li> D&amp;D has also produced an occasional Crystal Dragon Muhammad, as with the Loregiver of Zhakara or Al-Kalim of Ylaruam.

It's worth noting that Keith Baker, the setting's author, designed Eberron so that clerics of a given god do not have to share that god's alignment, allowing for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> villains among the ranks of good churches as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">anti heroes</a> among the darker faiths.

</li><li> The Triad of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em> — Tyr, being the oldest, ruling over the other two, despising evil and injustice, and having the most power at his command, is analogous to the Father. Ilmater, being a selfless and highly merciful god, whose clergy are encouraged to sacrifice themselves to aid those in misfortune, and whose message of hope appeals greatly to the poor and oppressed, is similar to the Son. Torm, with his inspiring courage, his sense of duty and obedience to Tyr, and his conviction in combating or destroying undead and evil forces, is much like the Holy Spirit. And then there are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">paladin orders</a>, most prominently Tyr's.
<ul><li> Note that Tyr is literally an aspect of the Tyr of Norse mythology. In the 4th Edition version <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a>, the Triad is broken. Tyr leaves the Realms after killing the god Helm in a duel over Tymora(!!) (then is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">killed in action</a> fending off a demonic invasion), Ilmater leaves the House of the Triad for Brightwater (the home of Sune, Lliira, Sharess, and Waukeen), and Torm steps up to fill Tyr's place (assuming most of his portfolios) in the Pantheon.
</li><li> Still, "The Triad" veneration is limited. It appears when they have to present an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">united front against a threat</a>, e.g. as patrons of hard-pressed folk. Janessar, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a> in corrupt Calimshan, venerate them along with Mielikki. In recently shattered Tethyr their main feature is united Knights Kuldar order based in one combined abbey, lots of people venerate them separately. Otherwise, Tyr is <em>by far</em> more important than the two others. Of course, Ilmater became well-known only after joining Tyr in his first years on Toril and they complement each other well ("Tyr, X suffers greatly!"), so remain close allies. Both Lathander and Helm (though he has a setback over Time of Troubles) being about as prominent and all five of their churches frequently band together in any combinations, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Tempus</a> grabs at least as much of the spotlight as any of them effortlessly. Other chaotic and neutral deities are more active than their churches, but most <em>powerful</em> are, probably, the ladies: Mystra (has so much power that she <em>must</em> lend about half to mortal "co-pilots"), Selune (one planetar per temple, <em>functional or not</em>, is a whole celestial army on Prime), Shar (has the Shadow Weave) and Chauntea (main agricultural deity plus joined Earthmother aspect). And another "Triad" <a class="urllink" href="http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/The_Three">bundle-venerated<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on Faerun is more from Wiccan History.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a></em>:
<ul><li> The setting features the Church of Ezra, which, despite centering on a female founder, is a faith in many ways very closely mimicking Christianity, the Catholic Church in particular. Apart from a generally very similar hierarchy, its history includes internal schisms, a branch sect mirroring the Anglican Church in the in-world version of England, and possibly very corrupt ties with an in-world version of the historical Borgias. Fanon takes this further, with devoted fan-made documentation describing the Church of Ezra's impact on the "faith of the loa" (an analogue of real-world Vodun practices) in the Southern-Gothic themed domain of the setting. Faiths in Ravenloft tend to be more inclined toward actual monotheism than is common in many other fantasy settings where, while gods may rival each other or war outright, it is common that the majority still acknowledge that the others exist. Ezra herself is a martyred <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a> Jesus, albeit a Jesus-figure without a Yahweh rather than vice versa.
</li><li> Also, the Ravenloft setting's Church of Hala has been depicted as having chaste nuns living in convents. The Order of the Guardians, though ostensibly non-denominational, also closely resembles a Christian monastic sect, right down to many followers' observing vows of silence.
</li><li> Ravenloft very specifically mentions that the gods can't (or won't) interfere directly in Ravenloft. It is <em>inconsistently</em> hinted that any divine powers clerics receive are, in fact, granted by the Dark Powers instead. For outlanders visiting the Domain of Dread, it is recommended that this loss of a close connection be played up to increase divine classes' sense of insecurity. Natives, who have never experienced anything else, expect the gods to be distant or absent.
</li><li> Ravenloft actually takes this trope to a new level; at least two of its deities, the Morninglord and the Lawgiver, are basically Crystal Dragon Jesus versions of deities from other settings. The Lawgiver is strongly implied to be Bane, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Faerunian</a> God of Tyranny, whilst the Morninglord could be read as either Pelor (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GreyHawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GreyHawk">Oerthian</a> God of the Sun) or Lathander (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Faerunian</a> God of the Sun), with evidence slightly weighed towards the latter. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3fd5k');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3fd5k" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3fd5k');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Morninglord is one of the titles given to Lathander by his faithful worshippers.</span>

The official, if now discredited, dogma that all other gods are false ones and actually demons in disguise, the god being a mortal who became a god after death, said ascension coming as a result of death by crucifixion... the holy symbol of Lothian is basically a Celtic cross (a cross with a circle where the four arms in it) with a depiction of Lothian crucified on top, as is the most common depiction of a Christian cross.
</li><li> The World of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Greyhawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Greyhawk">Greyhawk</a></em> has St. Cuthbert, whose church is quasi-Catholic, and is named after St. Cuthbert of Lindesfarne, a 7th-century English saint. Maybe this is a case of Crystal Dragon Sainthood, but still... The Cuthbert of Lindesfarne and the Cuthbert of Greyhawk are connected via a printed adventure (in Dragon #100) which takes place in real-world London.

<ul><li> The worship of the Emperor of Mankind is always depicted as having a distinct Roman Catholic flavor. 40K fluff has it that the Emperor was born in 10,000 BC, and spent the whole of human civilization guiding humanity from the shadows until he went public round about the year 30,000 AD to lead the crusades to reunite the human space empire. There is a strong implication that he was Jesus. Took him that long to realize that Love and Peace wasn't working. Seeing as he decided on an atheistic stance before he got mauled, maybe he just realized that faith just strengthened Chaos anyway. Also, there is at least some fluff which indicates that, though he saw the value of warfare in defense of humanity, the more over the top racism and xenophobia of the Imperium crept in after his "death".
</li><li> It's also hinted that the Emperor of Mankind was Saint George in the Book "Mechanicum". The Imperium is <em>huge</em>, and as much as they'd like to, the Ecclesiarchy can't maintain any kind of orthodoxy throughout it. Different planets have their own, vastly different, versions of the Imperial cult, which can be variants on this trope. The Cult of the people of Fenris is Crystal Wolf Norse Mythology, with the Emperor as Odin and the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Space Marine</a> base as Valhalla.
</li><li> The Cult Mechanicus has an even more literal version of this recognizing the Emperor as the Omnissiah, the physical manifestation of the machine god and part of a trinity with The Machine God, The Omnissiah, and The Motive Force.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em>, the (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Holy Roman</a>) Empire's main religion, the Cult of Sigmar, can be described as Roman Catholicism if Jesus was a mix of Charlemagne and Conan the Barbarian. Unlike many other examples of this trope, the Empire tolerates the open worship of the rest of Old World pantheon (basically a combo of various pre-Christian European religions), with most people praying to the appropriate god as needed; the rival Cult of Ulric is also a major political player.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SeventhSea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SeventhSea">7th Sea</a></em>, the Vaticine Church, Objectionist, and Ussuran Orthodox Churches stand in for Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, and Russian Orthodoxy in Theah, a swashbuckling, sorcerous version of medieval Europe. The Vaticine Church also subtly incorporates a few elements of Islam as well. Avalon, the local version of England, even has its version of the Anglican church.

The Lancea Sanctum itself is made up of many different creeds, ranging in flavor from Catholic to Protestant to evangelical to Muslim, but their core beliefs are strongly Gnostic.

Paternoster was founded by a Christian, so their beliefs are essentially a way of reconciling the Exarchs with monotheism.

<ul><li> The official religion of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Third Empire of Tamriel</a> (as well as the various Cyrodiilic Empires throughout history) is the Church of the Nine (originally Eight) Divines. Though polytheistic, it draws a number of parallels to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaintlyChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaintlyChurch">particularly benevolent view</a> of Christianity in terms of church hierarchy, imagery, architecture (notably Gothic), and general attitude. To note:
<ul><li> The religion is based around the worship of the Aedra, originally eight of the et'Ada ("original spirits") who sacrificed much of their divine power and very beings (including their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality">Complete Immortality</a>) in order to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreationMyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreationMyth">create Mundus, the mortal plane</a>, after being convinced/tricked (depending on the storyteller) by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsDead">"dead" creator god</a>, Lorkhan (aka Shor, Shezarr, Lorkhaj, etc.). The Aedra would be worshiped by many different cultures (often under different names) in Tamriel, including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">(High Elves)</a> and the ancient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbarianTribe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbarianTribe">Atmorans</a>/proto-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">Nords</a>. However, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors">Ayleids</a> ( "Wild Elves") of Cyrodiil instead tended toward Daedra worship, the et'Ada who made no sacrifices during creation and thus maintain their complete divinity. Though they technically operate on their own scales of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a> which put them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveGoodAndEvil">Above Good and Evil</a>, many of the Daedric Princes (the most powerful of the Daedra) tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods">extremely malevolent</a> toward mortals. This led the Ayleids down some extremely dark paths, including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveryIsASpecialKindOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveryIsASpecialKindOfEvil">enslavement</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">vile torture</a> of Cyrodiil's native Nedic people (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Precursors</a> of most of the modern races of Men in Tamriel). St. Alessia, one of those slaves, managed to escape and prayed to the Aedra for aid. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineIntervention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineIntervention">They granted it</a>, and (along with the aid of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHeroicOrc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHeroicOrc">rebel Ayleid lords</a> and the Nordic Empire to the north) Alessia's rebel forces were able to topple the Ayleid Empire, forming the First Cyrodiilic Empire of Men. As part of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BargainWithHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BargainWithHeaven">Bargain with Heaven</a>, Alessia made the worship of the Aedra the primary religion of her new Empire. However, the church itself was a political compromise, blending aspects of the religions of all the races within the new Empire to prevent destructive infighting.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod">Top God</a> of the Nine Divines pantheon is Akatosh, the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonsAreDivine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonsAreDivine">Dragon</a> God of Time". Akatosh is said to have been the first being to "manifest" out of the raw energy of the early universe and is also the "Father of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">Dragons</a>", who refer to him as "Bormah", draconic for "Father". According to some theories, they are not so much his "children" as they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PiecesOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PiecesOfGod">fragments of his very being</a>. Of the dragons, his "firstborn" is said to be Alduin, the draconic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastOfTheApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastOfTheApocalypse">Beast of the Apocalypse</a> whose coming heralds <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a>. According to Nordic mythology, Alduin is simultaneously Akatosh's son <em>and</em> an aspect of his very being, making the Jesus connection even stronger. Akatosh is also known to create the "Dragonborn", rare mortals gifted with the immortal souls of dragons. Throughout history, Dragonborns have acted as Messianic figures (or at the very lest, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen Ones</a>). (The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em> is one such Dragonborn, said to be the "Last Dragonborn".)
</li><li> Talos is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin">Deity of Human Origin</a> who joined the original Eight Aedra as the "Ninth" Divine. While exactly <em>how</em> he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">achieved apotheosis</a> is a hotly debated topic in-universe and out, but it is known that Talos is (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MergerOfSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MergerOfSouls">at least</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask">in part</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">Tiber Septim</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FounderOfTheKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FounderOfTheKingdom">founder of the Third Tamriellic Empire</a>. Talos worshipers place great emphasis on the fact that he was once a man before he ascended as a Divine. While this emphasis in-universe is likely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">racial</a> in nature, one of the core concepts of Christianity is 'hypostatic union': Jesus Christ is at once both wholly human and wholly divine. (The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">Civil War</a> secondary main quest to <em>Skyrim</em> has it's roots in the Empire's ban on Talos worship, forced onto them as part of the White-Gold Concordat by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHumanAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHumanAlliance">Aldmeri Dominion</a> under the leadership of the fascistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">Thalmor</a>.)
</li></ul></li><li> The main plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">Morrowind</a></em> focuses on a trinity religion called the Tribunal, three formerly mortal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical Gods</a> who have been at the heart of the Dunmeri (Dark Elven) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTheocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTheocracy">Theocracy</a> for thousands of years. It bears more than a passing resemblance to the Catholic Church - hagiography, apocrypha, an Inquisition, sainthood, and the idea of a "new covenant" supplanting the older Daedric cults of the Dunmer. The Nerevarine is another Messianic figure, being the supposed reincarnation of Nerevar, along with numerous prophecies surrounding them.
</li><li> All of that said, the actual <em>function</em> of reality in the <em>ES</em> universe is quite close to <em>Hinduism</em> in many regards. According to several references in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">background lore</a> as well as numerous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">developer written</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooseCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooseCanon">supplementary texts</a>, the universe runs in "kalpas", or cycles of time. When one ends, a new one begins. Additionally, the souls of mortals (which aren't otherwise bound to the mortal world or claimed by a specific deity) are said to enter the "Dreamsleeve", where they are broken down and recycled to be reincarnated.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>, being sort of based on Arthurian legend, has a fictional religion with many parallels to Christianity; the Temple of Time resembles a Christian sanctuary, the young Zelda wears a wimple like a nun or passion bearer and the three Golden Goddesses and their Triforce can be seen as a parallel to Christianity's Holy Trinity.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>,</em> Rauru, the Sage of Light, is dressed similar to a Franciscan monk.
</li><li> This was stronger earlier in the series. The "Book of Magic" in <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> is a "Bible" in Japan; Link's shield in the first two games bears a cross; in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a></em> (<em>Triforce of the Gods</em> in the original Japanese), Sanctuary is a Christian church, the kanji for the priest there are "holy father" (where Agahnim's kanji are "master of rituals"), and the artbook depicts Link in the Sanctuary, kneeling before a crucifix.
</li><li> Given the revelation that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that she is the human incarnation of the Goddess Hylia</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">Skyward Sword</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zelda</span> may actually be the biggest example of this in the franchise.
</li><li> Also, if you stretch it somewhat, the attributes of the Triforce are similar to a biblical principal. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> states that "God has not given us a spirit of fear, but a spirit of love, a spirit of power, and a sound mind." It also says "perfect love casts out fear." So, the Triforce's attributes—courage, power, and wisdom—basically equate to the spirit of love, the spirit of power, and a sound mind respectively.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrailsSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrailsSeries">Trails Series</a></em> has the Septian Church, which is very unambigously based around Catholicism. They worship <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherGoddess">Aidios</a> and are incredibly widespread across all of Zemuria. Similiarly to Catholicism, they're lead by a Pope, have a city-state of their own in the form of Arteria, and have similiar beliefs to Christianity, including the existance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireAndBrimstoneHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireAndBrimstoneHell">Gehenna</a> and having books of Testament <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsTheGoodBookSays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsTheGoodBookSays">which are frequently quoted</a>. Ironically enough, the only thing they really lack compared to Christianity is an explicit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">Messianic Archetype</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcRiseFantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcRiseFantasia">Arc Rise Fantasia</a></em>, North Noireism contains a patriarch, God (Eesa), and even a Jesus (Child of Eesa).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon">Harvest Moon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StoryOfSeasons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StoryOfSeasons">Story of Seasons</a></em> titles have a "Church", with obligatory priest-collar wearing pastor and "confession" as an occasional option. But the deity they worship is, in fact, the Harvest Goddess. She's a goddess that lives in lakes and is crucial to the rural towns that the characters live in. The Harvest Goddess is a physical being who can even be married in several titles, but the protagonist is one of the few who can see her. The <em>SOS</em> games are generally an intentional mash-up of Japanese culture, Western farming culture, and paganism. Noticeably, there are <em>multiple</em> Harvest Goddesses in various different towns around the series. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonSunshineIslands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonSunshineIslands">Sunshine Islands</a></em> shows that there are different denominations of Harvest Goddess worship, as the visitor Cliff's religious beliefs differ from the local's. More than one priest and nun wear a red symbol on their chest, similar to a cross (and, in fact, in <em>GBC3</em>, the local priest wore an actual cross).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonDS">Harvest Moon DS</a></em> revealed the Harvest King, while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonTreeOfTranquility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonTreeOfTranquility">Harvest Moon: Tree of Tranquility</a></em> revealed that there's a Harvest Lord as well (who is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a> to the Harvest Goddess). Also, <em>Harvest Moon: Island/Sun</em> adds a nun character into the mix of the universe's religion. In fact, the nun is coincidentally named after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NunsAreMikos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NunsAreMikos">demon hunter</a>. She can be married in <em>Sunshine Islands</em>, but it's implied that she's celibate because you can't have children with her.
</li><li> The original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon1">SNES game</a> makes references to multiple gods besides the Harvest Goddess (or the "Goddess of the Land" as the translation calls her). Being that they're from a farming town, the characters just prefer worshipping the Harvest Goddess. All other games dumb it down to the characters only worshipping one god, with occasionally the Harvest Lord also being worshipped.
</li><li> The Natsume-made games, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonLightOfHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonLightOfHope">Harvest Moon: Light of Hope</a></em>, have the characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhMyGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhMyGods">using the Goddess' name in vain</a>. The local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValleyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValleyGirl">Valley Girl</a> is especially fond of saying "oh-my-goddess".
</li></ul></li><li> The world of Spira in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em> is pretty much run by the local CDJ: Yevon. Except for the Al Bhed who are seen as heathens. To hammer the religious symbolism further, the Giant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhale">Space Whale</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is called <strong>Sin</strong>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em>'s nations all have different ways of honoring the same Goddess Altana; however, many of these are at least subtly reminiscent of Christianity, and San d'Oria's church very strongly so.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> has the theocratic city-state of Ishgard, which to go along with its gothic, French-esque aesthetic, very much much resembles medieval Christianity, from being led by an Arch-bishop with an outfit suspiciously similiar to that of a Pope, to having witch hunts against 'heretics'. However, in an interesting twist, Ishgard's religion is the same as that of the rest of Eorzea in that its actually <em>polytheistic</em>, they just reserve their woship for Halone, who is actually a god of <em>war</em> rather than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod">Top God</a> of said religion.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ActRaiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ActRaiser">ActRaiser</a></em> is somewhat of an unique example, as you <em>are</em> Crystal Dragon Jesus, with some obfuscating Greco-Roman elements tossed in. As the one true god of the gameworld, who was sealed and forgotten as evil overtook the land, you have to revive humanity and lead them to prosperity while destroying the demons that have conquered the earth. The creators of <em>Actraiser</em> have been quoted saying that it was based off of Judeo-Christian monotheism. In the Original Japanese, the player's character was God and Tanzra was named Satan.
</li><li> One of the best-known video game examples may be the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest">Dragon Quest</a></em> series. They may not use the Crystal Dragon Jesus heavily in the plot, but every game requires players to go to "confession" in a church to save the game. The buildings are also heavily influenced by Christian churches — large cathedral structures in the cities, and small huts with some pews and an altar in the farm villages. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVIII">Dragon Quest VIII</a></em> used a Goddess, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVII">VII</a></em> used a thinly-veiled analogue of the Judeo-Christian God (who was also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>), and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX">IX</a></em> had Zenus the Great Architect, but the rest of the games were vague about just <em>what</em> the deity in question was.
<ul><li> In the DS remakes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIV">Dragon Quest IV</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestV">V</a></em>, the thinly veiled Catholic religion's deity is consistently called "the goddess", and many people venerate the Zenith dragon, a so-called dragon-god, along-side of the goddess as her greatest servant. The Zenith dragon lives in a sky castle with a race of winged humans who are referred to as Angels by at least one NPC in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIV">DQIV</a></em>. His newly created cg appearance makes him look like he is made out of crystal or silver.
</li><li> Also, according to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestHeroesRocketSlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestHeroesRocketSlime">Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime</a></em>, the well known Slime enemy from the series worship a slime equivalent of the Goddess.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em> series, the Church of the Holy Light is pretty much a mix between Catholic Christianity (huge cathedrals, monasteries and zealous crusaders), Buddhism (meditation and the lack of deities), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForce">The Force</a> (a holy power binding all living beings together; it even comes with a hatred/insanity-based dark-side).
<ul><li> However, it was averted in <em>Warcraft I</em>, where the humans of Stormwind worshipped <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> and had concepts of Heaven and Hell. It was, however, since retconned into the current "nontheistic" religion of the Light. Elune might also qualify to an extent, since she's described as "the only true god(dess) in Azeroth" and had a "half-deity" son, Cenarius. (Whose father was a demigod <em>stag</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squick</a>.)
</li><li> The belief in God in Azeroth hasn't been written out entirely though, despite the Church of the Holy Light Retcon. Many followers of the Light believe that it is a (semi-, at least) sentient being rather than an impersonal force and there have been many references to it interceding on a personal basis. The WC 3 manual also makes reference to the fact that some in Azeroth believe that the universe was created by an all-powerful being. There's enough ambiguity that you can believe either based on the material.
</li><li> There ARE beings who are more or less angels (although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeing">Energy Being</a> angels) and deny being gods, claiming that they serve only "the Light" which may be THE God of Azeroth. These angels (Naaru) can be interacted with and spoken to, but generally do not intervene except in extreme cases, such as Sargeras (Satan Expy) corrupting the entire Eredar race.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic">Heroes of Might and Magic</a> V</em>, the Holy Griffin Empire worships Elrath, a literal dragon, whose cult is nevertheless a thinly-veiled (or, actually, not veiled at all) stand-in for Christianity, with churches, monks, inquisitors, saints, and angels. Androgynous angels with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">ridiculously huge swords</a>.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a> VI</em> and VII had the Path of Light, complete with robed monks, cathedrals and churches that would not have looked overly out of place in medieval Europe. VIII instead focused on the Path of Light's still-extant predecessor religion, the Church of the Sun, who goes for more colorful and frail-looking architecture.
</li></ul></li><li> Organized religion in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Ivalice</a> has all the trappings of Christianity, specifically Catholic ritual, from the Glabados Church of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em> to the Kildean religion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VagrantStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VagrantStory">Vagrant Story</a></em>. The latter finds ample representation in the Church of St. Iocus, a Catholic send-off in all but name that wields great political and military power, and whose sacred icon, called the Rood of Iocus, resembles a cross with four arms instead of two; also, the Cult of Mullenkamp, a heretical offshoot of the Kildean church whose adepts display an upside-down version of the Rood, called the Rood Inverse.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em> is especially blatant about this, to the point where it feels like all they did to Christianity is replace a few names. Start replacing "St. Ajora" with "Jesus" and see how much sense it makes. In the remake, instead of "God", you get "gods".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Thief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Thief">Thief</a></em> has the Hammerites, who worship the "Master Builder", but basically look like medieval Roman Catholicism with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk">Steampunk</a> trappings and the Heathen-smiting turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. The Hammerites undergo a schism between the first and second games, and naturally regard their offshoot brethren, the Mechanists, as arch-heretics. This is due to the Mechanists' favor of lots of automation (over only a <em>little</em> bit of automation) and of course, some good ol' fashioned chauvinist outrage (the Mechanists accept female acolytes). Essentially, the Mechanists are more or less a steam punk version of Protestantism; their leader is very similar to Martin Luther or John Calvin, the nobility see them as a way to make themselves richer and throw off the old religious order (much like the German nobles of the Reformation) and the Mechanists themselves are progressive whilst being arch-zealous at the same time, like many Calvinist Sects. They even have their own analogue to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a>: The Trickster, the pagan god of nature, who is naturally opposed to technology and civilization. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Garrett</a> can attest to the Trickster's existence- he <em>killed</em> him.</span>

Despite having churches and nuns, the Aquarians worship a goddess and all the pastors are female.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakengard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakengard">Drakengard</a></em>, the hierarchs are the priests or spiritual leaders of a vaguely-defined religion with a multitude of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTropeWithoutATitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTropeWithoutATitle">unnamed gods</a>. They carry staves and have ornamental robes and cast spells, so they resemble <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">D&amp;D</a></em> clerics. The game's sequel gives them more definition, with the Knights of the Seal as the spiritual side of the organization, dedicated to the seals' continuity and defense.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat6FiresOfLiberation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat6FiresOfLiberation">Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation</a></em>, the Emmerians worship a historical figure dubbed the "Golden King", and have a huge golden statue of him bearing his armor. It is quite clear that the Emmerians hold some kind of religious awe over him similar to that of Jesus or even God, but it mainly seems to be there just to differentiate the Emmerians from the apparently secular Estovakians.
<ul><li> When you take the out-of-game fluff (that is, pages upon pages of news articles, historical texts, blueprints, etc. that is always published on the web and nowhere else) into account, the Golden King seems like a thinly veiled King Arthur expy; it's just that the Emmerians are really, <em>really</em> fond of him. Incidentally, a handful of passing references to Christianity and Christian-derived holidays are made throughout the series.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry4">Devil May Cry 4</a></em> has the island of Fortuna, where the capital has a congregation called the Order of the Sword that worships Sparda.

</li><li> Though the tenets of the religion of Zakarum in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a></em> series aren't gone into much (or at all), the architecture and appearance of the various figures makes the similarity rather obvious. Interestingly, the religion in general (especially in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII">Diablo II</a></em>) takes more from Islam than Christianity, with its pope being known as the Que-Hegan that leads a High Council that, during the time of Diablo II, have been completely corrupted by Mephisto.
<ul><li> The novels expand on the tenants of Zakarum a little more, and it's typical Christian stuff such as forsaking evil in your heart, as well as preaching gentleness and forgiveness. More cynically, the church is also said to be very open to donations.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> games commonly do this, generally draping stories of "past hero" around a Bishop-class character. Usually the head deity/hero of the church will have the title of Saint. They aren't an actual God, just a really cool person. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemElibe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemElibe">Elibe games</a> have Saint Elimine. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones">The Sacred Stones</a></em> has the Theocracy of Rausten.

<ul><li> Actually played straight in <em>Path of Radiance</em> and <em>Radiant Dawn</em> with the Begnion Empire. It is a theocracy whose structure is almost identical to the Catholic Church, with the Apostle serving as a female Pope of sorts and the nobles of the country akin to the College of Bishops. These individuals are more than just leaders; they are respected members of their religion, as they are believed to be chosen by the Goddess herself. They honor <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ashera, who is the Order component of the goddess Ashunera. Ashunera, the 'Goddess of Dawn', incidentally caused a world-wide flooding that wiped out almost all civilizations of the world after she lost control of her divine powers. The guilt caused Ashunera to split into Ashera (order) and Yune (chaos). Yune is treated as an evil figure, and even referred to as a 'dark god'. So we have the 'good' goddess, Ashera, and the 'bad' goddess, Yune. God-Satan, anyone?</span>
</li><li> Although in the end it turned out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yune was the good one that loved beorc and laguz while Ashera was the evil one that would rather turn all sentient beings on the planet to stone rather than have them violate her idea of Order. After Ashera's asskicking and 1200 years, Ashunera becomes whole once again.</span>
</li><li> Then there is Naga from the rest of the series, who is the powerful leader of the Divine Dragons that many humans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedFalseFaith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedFalseFaith">falsely believe to be a god</a> despite Naga's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodIAmNot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodIAmNot">thoughts to the contrary</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Order in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Strife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Strife">Strife</a></em> are a bunch of religious zealots who worship a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpaceFleaFromNowhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpaceFleaFromNowhere">Giant Space Flea from Nowhere</a> and oppose all human reproduction, choosing to instead extend lifespans with cybernetic enhancements. They also rule the world and you have to help <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a> defeat them. The only mention of other religions in the game is a single line from Richter, a "Deus" that presumably was worshipped before the development of The Order.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terranigma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terranigma">Terranigma</a></em>, the main character acts as both Crystal Dragon Jesus and Crystal Dragon Moses. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">With The Elder and Beruga as the Satanic equivalent. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotSymbolic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotSymbolic">It's that kind of game.</a></span>
</li><li> Despite largely being based off Norse Myth, <em>Shadowbane</em> falls under this too. While the All-Father is presumed to be absent, incapacitated, or dead, prayers to saints and archons still work (much to the relief of the prelates and bishops). There's also an even more militant offshoot faith that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">likes burning heretics a little too much...</a>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SiegeOfAvalon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SiegeOfAvalon">Siege of Avalon</a> Anthology</em> <strong>almost</strong> averts this by replacing every single mention of religion with "spirits," but somehow still has crosses in the chapel. And the graveyards. And on monks' robes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a>: Prophecies</em>, the prophet who makes the titular prophecies is, quite literally, a Crystal Dragon.
<ul><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em>, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Glint is murdered by her former boss Kralkatorrik. Unfortunately Glint's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">Plot Armor</a> wasn't sufficient enough to warrant a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsNotPermanent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsNotPermanent">Resurrection Shrine</a>.</span> Kralkatorrik is just as much a Crystal Dragon as Glint, but whose alignment is the exact opposite of Glints. In effect between the two Games you have a Crystal Dragon Jesus, and a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonSatan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonSatan">Crystal Dragon Satan</a> not to mention a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragon">Crystal Dragon</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>, the latter two both being the same entity.
<ul><li> With the <em>Heart of Thorns</em> expansion, players can explore the golden city of Tarir in Auric Basin. Tarir was founded by the Exalted, followers of Glint who shed their mortal forms to become beings of pure energy, and their attitude toward her is very much that of devoted disciples. The Zephyrites, who literally carry <em>pieces of Glint's body</em> in the form of crystals imbued with the Aspects of Sun, Wind, and Lightning, are also her devotees.
</li><li> The crystal dragon pantheon expands in the Path of Fire expansion, where Glint's daughter Aurene begins taking a larger role in the plot. Not only does she have the same worshippers as her mother, along with prophecies that star her—<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she even returns from the dead.</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Andrastian Chantry is an amalgam of several Abrahamic faiths.
<ul><li> The Chantry itself is somewhat a mix of the Byzantine Orthodoxy and the Catholic Church. The church is lead by a "Divine" who, much like the Pope in real life, takes on a different name upon being beatified. As a departure, only women are allowed in the upper echelons of the order: there are only Revered Mothers (bishops), no male Grand Clerics (cardinals), and no male Divine, except for the schism of the religion in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">Tevinter Imperium</a> (which also allows mages to be clerics, considered extremely heretical by the Chantry of the rest of Thedas). They have also been known to call for Exalted Marches (crusades) against religious enemies. <br/>The Chantry's messiah figure Andraste mixes elements of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a>, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Muhammad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Muhammad">Muhammad</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsefulNotes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsefulNotes">Useful Notes</a>/Boudica, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JoanOfArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JoanOfArc">Joan of Arc</a>. She was chosen by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCosmicDenominator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCosmicDenominator">The Maker</a> rather late in life to be his prophetess (Mohammed) for being exceptionally devout and a true believer (Mary, Mohammed, Joan). She then unified the factions of dissenters against the religious establishment and created an army which she led on a highly successful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades">Exalted March</a> (Mohammed, Joan), leading the setting's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Fantasy Counterpart Culture</a> for the Britons against the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Rome equivalent</a> (Boudica). She was later betrayed by some of her closest generals and advisers (Jesus) and burnt at the stake (Jesus, Joan). However, she was never regarded as a child of the Maker, nor was she ever resurrected. Finally, her name comes from a Celtic war goddess that was, according to Roman historians, invoked by Boudica before going into battle.
</li><li> Amusingly enough, there is an example of a cult worshiping a dragon that they believe is a reincarnation of Andraste.
</li></ul></li><li> There are also the Qunari, whose teachings are a lot closer to a strand of extremist Confucianism. However in the game, they clearly stand in for the expansion of Islam into Southern Europe during the middle ages. Coming over the sea, they settled some parts of Thedas and converted the people to the Qun (Spain, Southern Balkans), which caused the Chantry to call for Exalted Marches to push them back (the crusades), and they regard it as their duty to spread knowledge of the divine law to the infidels, which goes hand in hand with expanding their empire. There are also some aspiring converts in Kirkwall in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>, which causes (local) terrorists to plan attacks with weapons of mass destruction to fight the spread of the heretic techings of the Qunari.
</li></ul></li><li> Played perfectly straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline">Ragnarok Online</a></em>. There is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> class (the Crusader), a Priest and Acolyte class, scapulars are acolyte-class armor, Holy Water can be created by the Acolyte class, many of the Priest's protective skills are named after Catholic ceremonies or liturgies, and there's even a Vatican in the city of Rachel. Very strongly Catholic-flavored. However, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NunsAreMikos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NunsAreMikos">Nuns Are Mikos</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMonksKnowKungFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMonksKnowKungFu">All Monks Know Kung-Fu</a>, the Pope is a cute little blonde loli, Jesus is completely unmentioned, God is hopelessly conflated with the entire ancient Nordic pantheon of Asr, and finally, underneath the Vatican, God turns out to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> — though the Crusader skill that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">literally asks God to punch the target in the face STILL WORKS ON IT</a>. To sum up Ragnarok's take on God: God is Jesus is Odin is Thor is Frigga is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Azathoth</a>. The whole religious structure is so hilariously disconnected from "real" Christianity once you get past the surface, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice">incredible</a>.
<ul><li> However, there are <em>two</em> different churches. Rune Midgard Kingdom has Church of Odin and Arunafeltz State has Church of Freya, which worship completely different Gods. In general, Church of Odin is treated as the better one of the two.
</li><li> Meanwhile, Church of Freya has two different factions. While one is good, the other one is borderline heretic. The heretics do horrible things, including but not limited to: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">manipulated the Pope for their liking, froze the Pope's twin brother since he was born by threatening Guardian of Ice to do it, worked with Rekenber Corporation to build undestructible cyborg soldiers with Artificial Heart of Ymir planted into them, planned to start a war with the good factions and Rune Midgard Kingdom with those soldiers, killed every single members of Rune Midgard Kingdom royal family, kidnapped King Tristan III and killed him in an abandoned monastery.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em>, most humans worship Saradomin, god of order. Saradominist churches and clergy have a Christian appearance to them. Zamorak, god of chaos, is treated as a Satanic figure by Saradominists but enjoys a strong following among <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">certain monsters</a> and some humans.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IronGrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IronGrip">Iron Grip</a></em> series has Trithinism, worshipped primarily by the Fahrong nation (who even made it their official state religion). Though not much is shown of its theological nature, its history seems to mirror the developments of both <a class="urllink" href="http://www.irongrip.net/index.php?view=3963">Christianity and Islam<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in several ways. There is also some mention of a concept similar to the belief in reincarnation.

The church of Tenses in Kania has trappings very similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OrthodoxChristianity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OrthodoxChristianity">Russian Orthodox Church</a>. There is also Nezeb, who is a Crystal Dragon Lenin.
</li><li> The Church of Yahvo, faith of the D'ni from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Myst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Myst">Myst</a></em> series, had its own versions of Heaven and Hell (conceived as Ages), divinely-inspired prophets, and its own foretold messiah (the Great King).
</li><li> The Anju religion mentioned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Solatorobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Solatorobo">Solatorobo</a></em> is essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianityIsCatholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianityIsCatholic">Catholicism</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace">WITH BIRDS!</a> To be able to enter their holy forest where all the birds live when they're not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Psychopomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Psychopomp">guiding souls to the afterlife</a>, you need to obtain a string of rosary beads, and lore says they always have a Bible on hand and worship in churches on Sundays.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/UltimaIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/UltimaIV">Ultima IV</a></em>: You basically create a church like this, with you as the Christ figure and Lord British as the pope.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a></em>: Starting with the Gods and Kings expansion pack in <em>V</em>, you can found religions and choose the beliefs of the religions. It can range from playing this trope straight, with your Shinto religion having a Papacy, making Cathedrals, and believing in a Messiah, or invert by having a Christian state religion where you believe in a Sea God, have Mosques, and think religious idols are holy. The model was carried over into <em>VI</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKings">Crusader Kings</a> II</em>, sufficiently strong pagan rulers can, under the right circumstances, reform their respective faiths, creating an organized religion with a formal priestly hierarchy and written holy texts. Note that In this case the religions involved actually did exist (except maybe Zunism) but never achieved the same level of organization as Christianity and Islam in the real world and it's that they can restructure into very similar religious structures and practices. The details, however, vary depending on which expansions you have.
<ul><li> In the initial version with the <em>The Old Gods</em> DLC, it's implied that these reforms are inspired by contact with and directly patterned after the Christian and Islamic religious bodies. In particular, Germanic Paganism creates a structure similar to the Islamic Caliphates, while the other Pagan faiths all adopt a model more based on the Catholic model of apostolic succession.
</li><li> In the newer version introduced by the <em>Holy Fury</em> DLC, reformed Pagans pick a nature, two doctrines, and a leadership structure. With the right combinations, they can closely model Christianity (Catholic, Orthodox, and anti-clerical heresy flavors), Islam, Zoroastrianism, or Indian and Chinese faiths.
<ul><li> By combining the Proselytizing nature, Monasticism and Ancestor Veneration doctrines, and Hierocratic (Catholic-like), Autocephalous (Orthodox-like), or Autonomous (anti-clerical (eg. Lollard or Waldensian) like), a reformed Pagan faith can structure itself very similarly to Christianity and have very similar mechanics, with Monasticism enforcing priestly celibacy and allowing characters to take religious vows and be removed from succession and Ancestor Veneration being a similar concept to sainthood.
</li><li> By combining the Dogmatic nature, any two of Religious Tax, Agnatic/Enatic Clans, or Polygamy doctrines, and Temporal leadership, the faith can at least mechanically mirror Islam. Religious Tax is essentially Jizya, Agnatic and Enatic Clans enforce single-gender inheretance and make the "open" succession used by Muslims in-game the norm for the religion, and Polygamy allows characters of the faith to have up to four wives, much like Muslim men are permitted<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note438zq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note438zq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note438zq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Polygamy is mutually exclusive with Enatic Clans, but Enatic Clans enables the taking of consorts, while Agnatic clans allows the taking of concubines if the faith didn't already permit doing so</span>. Temporal leadership mechanically mirrors the Islamic Caliphates. Starting with the Bön faith can bring it even closer, as their special Monastic Feudal government (shared with Buddhists) allows characters to hold both castles and temples and enables spending piety to change laws, much like the Islamic Iqta government.
</li><li> By combining the Proselytizing nature, Divine Marriage doctrine (the other doctrine being essentially a free slot), and Hierocratic leadership, Pagans can recreate the mechanics of the restored Zoroastrian faith, or by using Autonomous leadership, aim closer to its state at the start of the game, with the Divine Marriage doctrine creating a similar system to Zoroastrian Xwedodah close-kin marriages. The Zunists of Afghanistan (who may or may not have even existed, historical records are unclear) are likely to do this, with Divine Marriage being wrapped into their special doctrine.
</li><li> By combining the Peaceful (specifically Jain-like) or Cosmopolitan nature (more similar to Buddhism, Hinduism, and Taoism), any combination of Monasticism, Stability, or Meritocracy, and Autonomous leadership, reformed Pagans can model their faith after Taoism and the Indian faiths with Monastacism serving a similar role to what it does in mimicking Christian mechanics, Meritocracy enabling heir designation much like Jainism, Buddhism, and Taoism, and Stability eliminating short-reign penalties, similar to Jainism, Taoism, and Buddhism, which have reduced or eliminated short-reign penalties. If the AI reforms the Bön faith — which is heavily Buddhist-influenced in real life and plays like a Buddhist/pagan hybrid while unreformed — they are extremely likely to do this, unless the reformer is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">too bloodthrsty</a> to take Peaceful.
</li><li> It is also possible to entirely avert this trope by doubling down on the old ways or coming up with completely different combinations that in no way mirror the the structures and gameplay mechanics of existing religions.

It has no deity, and indeed seems to be centered around a humanist <em>opposition</em> to the supernatural.

Resident deities are Venus, Aeon and the Mother, Lamia. However, it's not all it looks on the surface - the Trinity seems to be linked if not outright responsible for the continued existence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtefactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtefactOfDoom">the Skull Heart</a> and Skullgirls in the Canopy Kingdom, and the main figurehead of the church and avatar of Lamia is Double - a shapeshifting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> that disguises itself as a nun and seeks out new candidates for wielding the Skull Heart.

Sunday mass, churches, crosses, and Catholic-looking vestments are all the norm (though the latter are likely a result of using the standard RPG Maker graphics pack rather than an intentional artistic decision). The main difference is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> had <em>two</em> children; one of them, "The Mother", gave birth to the world, while the other, "The Eater", was a lazy hedonist who only devoured his sister's creations. The society of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid">Winged Humanoids</a> claim that wingless humans are the children of the Eater, and use this to persecute them.

Their aesthetic is very Catholic, but their belief system integrates Japanese Buddhism as well.

However, Hydeland's figure of worship isn't a Jesus analogue but the three goddesses Althena, Jula, and Vernas, who are based on various goddesses from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a>.
</li><li> The lore of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta">Bayonetta</a></em> franchise is heavily steeped in old testament of Christianity, in particular the literal designs of the angels featured in the game.

Also, while not said outright, it is strongly insinuated that classic religions do exist (what with the presence of churches and nuns), but Paradiso is only worshiped as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyCloudHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyCloudHeaven">Fluffy Cloud Heaven</a> due to the angels being basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Villain with Good Publicity</a>.
</li><li> The unnamed religion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightInTheWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightInTheWoods">Night in the Woods</a></em> is ambiguously Judeo-Christian.

On the other hand, the symbol is an 8-pointed star, God is referred to as a "They", "Longest Night" is a solstice celebration, and the three words appearing in the sanctuary are Faith, <em>Peace</em>, and <em>Joy</em> ("Hope, and Love" are the equivalent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Christianity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Christianity">fruits of the spirit</a>).
</li><li> The Light in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkestDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkestDungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a></em> draws heavily on medieval Christianity for its imagery and terminology.

The former has a conventional cross and cross-in-a-fish imagery associated with it, as well as conventional pastors and churches, although the stained glass portrays a glowing god and human monk and a stag rather than the traditional Christian version. It's apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard">fact for the universe</a>. The latter is treated as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">speciest</a>, unpleasant to "heathens", and misguided — to the point where an exorcism involves holy water, the use of a modesty ward like a cross, and a Latin chant that translates to "May faulty logic undermine your entire philosophy" — but not intentionally evil or cruel. The Universal Church still has a suspiciously cross-with-a-circle-looking symbol, similar to the Presbyterian cross or High cross but with crystals slapped onto the side, a pastor with priest collars, and a very church-like church.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LookingForGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LookingForGroup">Looking for Group</a></em>, the Sisters and Sons have a roughly similar dogma to real-world Christianity, if you replaced God with a bunny rabbit.

The Sufferer's symbol and that of his followers (that is to say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternZodiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternZodiac">the Cancer sign</a>) even derives from his method of execution!
<ul><li> However, instead of growing in power and becoming a dominant religion, The Sufferer's religion remained a small cult, eventually fading away and nearly vanishing from history. It helps that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">genocidal totalitarian empress</a> probably made a point of killing anyone even remotely associated with it.

<ul><li> The Truth of Zod in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/OpenBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/OpenBlue">Open Blue</a></em> is more or less the Roman Catholic Church under a different name, with a couple of differences, namely, the lack of a Jesus, and the fact that the God they worship is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingOfAllCosmos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingOfAllCosmos">drunken bastard who likes armwrestling</a> with an expy of Cthulhu.

</li><li> What we've seen of the worship of Khersis in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfMU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfMU">Tales of MU</a></em> is very much like Christianity, except in a world where gods are known to speak to mortals, demons are real, and exorcism works. Considering the one passage from the Khersian holy book that's been referenced parallels the gospels directly and one creation myth says he was born of a great dragon from a crystal egg, he may be a literal "Crystal Dragon Jesus".

<ul><li> Robotology from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>. Coupled with Robot Judaism, whose followers believe that Robot Jesus existed and was very well programmed, but he wasn't their messiah. There's also the Lizard Space Pope, a throwaway joke about "all powerful Atheismo", and a literal incarnation of Heaven. Basically, they really like to play with this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Disenchantment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Disenchantment">Disenchantment</a></em> brings us Dreamland's religion, which is still in the early stages. It's still unclear, even to the High Priestess, if there is a God, if there isn't a God, or if there's more than one God.
<div class="indent"><strong>Big Jo:</strong> O lord, our only God, brother of the other God...

</li><li> Completely intentional, but the Super Adventure Club in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> episode, "The Return of Chef", is clearly meant to mock and mirror Scientology.
</li><li> The various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> continuities have various incarnations of the god Primus, who has been portrayed as alternately an extremely powerful but tangible being, an actual god, or a tangible Transformer creator figure whose vehicle mode just happens to be the planet Cybertron. When in his most god-tastic form, Unicron often plays the Devil to his God. Word of God suggests that The Fallen is playing this role in the live-action movies. And there's the minor detail that Optimus Prime has effectively become some kind of Robot Jesus — sometimes referred to as Optimus Christ. Greatly aided by the fact that his tendency to die and be resurrected shortly thereafter is more or less a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">running gag</a> at this point.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone">The Dreamstone</a></em> is an allegory of Milton's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParadiseLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParadiseLost">Paradise Lost</a></em>, where the Devil rebels against God and is expelled from heaven. As "Lord Highest", the Dream Maker represents God, and the dark lord Zordrak represents "Satan Himself" (or "Nasta Shelfim" as he was known in the pilot episode). Planet Dreamstone resembles a cathedral, the interior of the Dream Maker's castle resembles a church, and the volcanic land of Viltheed resembles hell or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mordor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mordor">Mordor</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CaptainScarletAndTheMysterons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CaptainScarletAndTheMysterons">Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons</a></em> has female pilots known as Angels protecting Cloudbase.

</li><li> In "Bao Bao's Revenge" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MaoMaoHeroesOfPureHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MaoMaoHeroesOfPureHeart">Mao Mao: Heroes of Pure Heart</a></em>, a mother hides her children from Bao Bao and then makes a heart symbol over her body while saying "Oh, Mother Pure Heart, protect us". It's the equivalent of crossing yourself.
