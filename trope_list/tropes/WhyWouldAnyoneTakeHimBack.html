</p><p>Sometimes one of the partners comes off as more of an ass than intended and reconciliation breaks the willing suspension of disbelief that the wounded partner would ever take the wounder back.

<ul><li> Old Charles Atlas comic book ads often featured a one-page example: Mac's girlfriend Grace joined in on the mocking when a bully kicked sand in his face. Then, after Mac works out enough to punch out the bully, she takes him back declaring he's a real man. This was mocked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FlexMentallo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FlexMentallo">Flex Mentallo</a></em>, where after the girlfriend says, "Oh, Mac, you <em>are</em> a real man after all!" he answers, "That's right, and a real man has no need for a two-timer like you."

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HotGimmick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HotGimmick">Hot Gimmick</a></em> with Ryoki and Hatsumi's relationship. They break up and get back together countless times. It mostly ends with Ryoki going to Hatsumi, demanding her to ask for forgiveness and tell him she wants to become his girlfriend again. Which she does each time, without fail. This is also the reason why so many fans hated the ending. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">The author decided to make a novel continuation where Hatsumi ends up with a much nicer man</a>.
</li><li> At the end of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Area88" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Area88">Area 88</a></em> manga, Ryoko and Shin reunite, after Shin has repeatedly broken Ryoko's heart. Then again, this <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr">Ryoko</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">we're</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">talking</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouDumb">about</a>. Keep in mind though that at the series finale Shin has suffered <em>total</em> amnesia after the final battle. He doesn't remember Area 88 or that he treated Ryoko like shit. Ryoko sees this as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipResetButton">Relationship Reset Button</a>, and that's how things end up for them.
</li><li> Haruto keeps taking back Yuzuki in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimiNoIruMachi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimiNoIruMachi">Kimi no Iru Machi</a></em>. She never tells him anything, takes on things that require him to go out of his way to save her, flat out lies to him, breaks up with him without a word, and now after an argument over a misunderstanding on her part (again) she storms out of Haruto's house, blocks his number, leaving him to file a missing persons report with how he can't get in contact with her and no one has seen her. For some reason, he does everything he can to keep her.
<ul><li> Seo Kouji seems to love this trope, with his earlier work <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Suzuka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Suzuka">Suzuka</a></em> featuring a girl who does just about all the same things as the female lead of <em>Kimi no Iru Machi</em>, but <em>worse</em>. Her ability to never admit anything or try to fix any relationship issues they face, leaving any and all such acts to the boyfriend she abuses and abandons <em>constantly</em> are the entire cause of relationship issues they face throughout the story. And the male lead comes back <em>every</em> <em>single</em> <em>time</em>, usually being viewed as the one at fault in a situation obviously not his own.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Hatori</a> and Chiaki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SekaiIchiHatsukoi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SekaiIchiHatsukoi">Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi</a></em> are shown to be the most unstable pairing in the series constantly fighting and accusing each other of cheating on one another. Yet at the end of the episode, they end up making up (at the expense of poor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyChildhoodFriend">Yuu</a>).
</li><li> Sakura and Sasuke in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>. In Part I, Sakura had a crush on Sasuke despite the fact that he spent most of his time being a moody asshole. While it was initially portrayed as a shallow crush, Sakura develops genuine feelings for him once she understands him better. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Sasuke eventually abandons his friends for the sake of revenge</a>. At one point, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillTheOnesYouLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillTheOnesYouLove">Sakura tries to take him down herself</a> to spare Naruto the pain of doing it. She can't bring herself to kill him, and Sasuke stabs her. Despite this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleTargetSexuality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleTargetSexuality">she's still in love with him</a> and convinces herself that Naruto can bring him back. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HazyFeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HazyFeelTurn">When Sasuke finally does rejoin the ninja</a>, Sakura seems conflicted about it. The story begins to portray her obsession with him as being unhealthy, and how no matter what he does, she'll still love him. When Sasuke goes crazy again, Sakura tries to talk him down again, saying that if he ever cared about her he'll stop. Sasuke responds by knocking her out with an illusion that he's stabbing her again. Sasuke directly tells <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">Kakashi</a> that he has no interest in Sakura, and can't understand why she has feelings for him in the first place, sentiments that most of the fans agreed with. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Despite all that, after a permanent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, Sasuke and Sakura end up marrying and having a daughter together (who bizarrely enough looks more like a daughter of Sakura and <em>Karin</em>, if not for that being biologically impossible). For bonus points, Sasuke apparently skipped out on them sometime after she was born. However, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Boruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Boruto">Boruto</a></em> anime and in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarutoGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarutoGaiden">Naruto Gaiden</a></em> manga Sasuke specifically says: "<em>My wife</em> isn't weak." Which only serves to muddle the issues of their relationship further in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">fans'</a> eyes.</span>.
</li><li> Ohgi and Villetta in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>. In the first season, Ohgi finds Villetta and falls for her while she is in an amnesiac state and forgets she is a Britannian soldier on the other side of the war. In the season finale, she regains her memories and shoots him, helping lead to the failure of the Black Rebellion and the capture of him and the rest of the Black Knights, save for Kallen, C. C., and Urabe. Even so, Ohgi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLoveIsUnrequited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLoveIsUnrequited">still has feelings for her</a> and opts to sneak off and meet her in the middle of the second season, knowing she is an enemy spy and fully intends to kill him. Even though they do reconcile shortly after, it is still considered very unsatisfying, as Villetta still manages to act against Lelouch by convincing Ohgi to turn on him in episode 19, even though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">she's hardly the right person to trust on this</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Arisa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Arisa">Arisa</a></em> ends with Arisa and Midori being together because they are truly in love. This is after Midori revealed how mentally unhinged he was, was directly responsible for horrific events, manipulated everyone in class (including Arisa, the girlfriend he supposedly loves so much, too), and tried to kill Arisa's twin sister numerous times and their mother.

Until they actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking">broke up for good</a>, their mutual treatment towards each other had become so toxic that it raised serious questions <em>what</em> was making them think that getting married would be a good idea, and after the wedding, things didn't get any better. It took Oliver becoming a killer for Dinah to give back her wedding ring, and even that she regretted.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/AndyCapp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/AndyCapp">Andy Capp</a></em>, Flo occasionally throws Andy out (whenever she grows a spine), but always takes him back later. In one strip she feels depressed, seemingly for no specific reason. Then Andy comes by the door and asks her to take him back. She accepts, and adds to herself: "I might as well <em> 'ave</em> a reason!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Popeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Popeye">Popeye</a></em>: While Olive Oyl can be flighty in the cartoons, in the newspaper comic, she's outright bipolar, dumping him on a literal whim, coming back to him at the end of the arc as if nothing happened, and making insane demands on Popeye in between. And Popeye never considers not taking Olive back.

Not only does she go off with him when he returns, but is happy to marry him after he makes her hide from his wife, fails to realize the queen tries to cook Talia and her children alive, and finally punished her by way of throwing his wife into a fire. It's probably worth noting that the moral of the story is "The person who is favored by fortune has good luck even while sleeping."

She broke up with him after finding out he'd lied to her for the entirety of their relationship: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he initially only dated her to get her into bed on a dare and even after developing feelings for Tessa he kept this from her</span>. He also spent a lot of their relationship being a controlling, condescending jerk to her. After they break up Tessa's life seems to greatly improve; she becomes more mature and responsible, including focusing on her studies, working on getting her dream internship, ditching toxic friends, and reconciling with her mother and ex-boyfriend. The only apparent pro to her staying with Hardin is regular sex, which doesn't really outweigh all the cons.

It's worse in that she's presented as being in the wrong all along while they treated her work commitments (and her daring to speak to a man that wasn't her boyfriend) as a personal betrayal. While she didn't need to obsess over her job to the point that she was blowing off an evening with her father to book Miranda a flight out of Miami in a hurricane, her friends generally berated and abused her for even attempting to stay employed - in New York City no less. Note that her boyfriend, as a chef, would likely be working the same crazy unpredictable hours as well, so this just comes off as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a>. Then that incredibly dicky bit where she gives them all that nice stuff and they pay her back by stealing her phone when she's taking a work call. Ironically, in the book, her friends were much more sympathetic - and one of them actually <em>encouraged</em> her to talk to the guy.
</li><li> The film <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LifeDrawing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LifeDrawing">Life Drawing</a></em>. Mark Ruffalo's 'hero', a struggling artist is a complete ass to the female lead when they are together, being patronising, insulting and indifferent/hostile to her life and beliefs as a member of the USAF while she tries to take an interest in his - her worst and only crime is being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a> and (mildly) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">ditzy</a>.

Eventually, he stops, is willing to set up a date with another man for her, and later explains himself and apologizes, sincerely saying he's willing to leave her life if she wants him to. In most movies, his crazy actions would just win the girl over, but here he actually has to work at it.
</li><li> Semi-averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CrazyHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CrazyHeart">Crazy Heart</a>.</em> Bad Blake is a good guy, but after he gets drunk and loses his girlfriend's four-year-old son in a shopping mall, it's hard to disagree with her when she never wants to see him again, even after the kid is found. When Bad stops drinking and generally puts his life together, he finds she's moved on and is engaged, but the two of them manage to still be friends.

They're back together by the beginning of the third act. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They do get married at the end of the movie... where Prof. Brainard is there <em>by video proxy</em>, meaning he made a conscious effort not to show up this time.</span>

Both halves of the deception are revealed; both parties are hypocritically furious and dump each other, then decide in the end that they're meant to be together after all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ABronxTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ABronxTale">A Bronx Tale</a></em>, featuring a taboo-breaking interracial relationship in the eponymous New York borough in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>, has the white protagonist C <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">Easily Forgiven</a> by his black girlfriend Jane for <em>calling her brother the n-word</em>. Sure, her brother actively denied that C was trying to save him from being beaten by his racist friends and was even saying that he was the one that punched him, but that should take more explanation than throwing a slur.
</li><li> The gender-flipped version of the trope is in most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BusterKeaton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BusterKeaton">Buster Keaton</a>'s films. A common scenario is his love interest will flat-out refuse him at the beginning unless he "makes it big". With few exceptions, he always wins her heart in the end, with broken ribs and concussions in the process.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGeneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGeneral">The General</a></em>, even after he saved the girl from the enemy, and stopped an invasion, it appeared as if she was still going to dump him when he was forced to take off his uniform at the end. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">But then he gets a shiny new Lieutenant's uniform, causing her to run into his arms.</span>

She ran off to sleep with him in the <em>five minutes</em> it took Carl to run upstairs and ask Gavin for a condom. Later on, Dave makes mention that they did it three or four times, suggesting that <em>after</em> Carl caught them together, they decided to keep at it until she left the next morning. All the while with Carl heartbroken right across the hallway. <em>And he takes her back.</em>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WallStreetMoneyNeverSleeps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WallStreetMoneyNeverSleeps">Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps</a></em>, the protagonist is in a relationship with Gordon Gecko's daughter Winnie. When he meets Gecko, she refuses to have a relationship with her father and warns the protagonist about him. The protagonist then starts to see him behind Winnie's back, and the pair plot to win her over. The protagonist then finds out that Winnie has a fortune on a foreign bank account and persuades her into giving <em>all</em> of it to his pet project. They're then double-crossed by Gordon, the truth is discovered, and Winnie promptly dumps the protagonist. So far so good, but here's the kicker: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the protagonist hunts down Gordon and literally trades access to his and Winnie's unborn child in return for him giving the money back - money that Winnie doesn't care about, mind you. The movie ends with Gordon hunting the crazy kids down and giving a speech asking Winnie to take the protagonist back. In that speech he also lets slip that he not only knows the child's gender, but that the protagonist is its father too, effectively telling Winnie that her ex betrayed not only her yet again, but their son as well.

She does kill Bane before he can kill Batman, but this is <em>after</em> all of the previously mentioned items. In the epilogue, they're in a relationship, and both have left their lives in Gotham behind</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FailureToLaunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FailureToLaunch">Failure to Launch</a></em> is a rare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flip</a> version; the man is expected to take back his girlfriend, even though said girl had only pretended to be in love with him to drive him out of his parents' home (see, if you boost a man's self-esteem by dating him, he'll start doing things for himself and it'll stick even if you dump him later on) and he's understandably <em>pissed</em> when he finds out.
<ul><li> On top of that: Not only was she only pretending to be in love with him for most of the movie, but there's also the fact that EVERY SINGLE THING he knew about her was a lie she made in order to seem more interesting to him, including that she had a dog that had to be sacrificed. Near the beginning, she said that the only thing she didn't do was have sex with the people she "helped". Guess what she does the moment she learns that he's about to dump her? Yeah, exactly. Also, even by the ending of the movie, she never actually regrets the fact that she made a living out of lying to people, only this one, and only because he found out and became enraged. His friends and family then go as far as tying him to a chair and locking him in a closet in order to force him to take her back. They try to tell the viewer that she's also stuck there since the doors to the house are locked, but said doors are mostly made of glass. If anything, she could at least have untied him so he could break the glass with the chair.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hitch">Hitch</a></em> has the reporter Sara, who spends most of the film trying to expose the title's "Date Doctor" while (unknowingly) going out with him. She ends up exposing him, destroying his anonymity and business, and almost destroys another relationship. She does so under the misguided belief that Hitch only helped jerks get laid based on <em>one</em> incident where she only had half the facts (the jerk acted on his own) where a friend of hers got hurt, proving she is a lousy, not to mention unethical, reporter; you don't write a story with one viewpoint, and you don't write a story in which you're <em>personally involved</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">Hitch calls her out on all of this</a>, as well on women like her making dating impossible for ordinary guys. Although she later gives him a heartfelt apology, Hitch very deservedly refuses to accept it. It ends when Hitch later <em>goes to her door to beg for <strong>her</strong> forgiveness!</em> After that, she responds to his begging for forgiveness by basically just deliberately jerking him around for a while. Just for her own sadistic amusement. It's only after she further breaks his heart and makes him plead a bit more that she finally takes him back.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WomanOnTop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WomanOnTop">Woman On Top</a></em> has the main character break up with her boyfriend because he cheated on her, merely because she always had to be the one on top during sex (she got motion sickness otherwise) meant he was looked at as less of a man. He sings her some songs and she immediately accepts him back. (Not helped by the fact that her love interest for most of the story is a good man, and she broke up with him after what comes down to a simple lovers spat but was treated like it was a violation of trust.)
</li><li> Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flip</a> example: towards the end of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CatchAndRelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CatchAndRelease">Catch And Release</a></em> new lovers Grey and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fritz</span> have split up, mostly because he overheard her declaring <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsNotMyGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsNotMyGirlfriend">that the relationship</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GutPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GutPunch">less than nothing</a>. </span> (Her attempts to explain are... markedly inadequate.) Despite this, as soon as she shows up at his place, he doesn't even let her get halfway through an apology before the big kiss ensues.
</li><li> Stan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightmareAlley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightmareAlley">Nightmare Alley</a></em> repeatedly rips off and uses everybody he meets, including his girlfriend (and later wife) Molly but she still loves him, despite the fact that by the end of the film, he's a hopeless alcoholic and even a carny geek.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avalanche" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avalanche">Avalanche</a></em>, David Shelby spends most of the movie not only belittling his ex-wife Caroline but also being a complete jerk to everyone else.

His idea of apologizing (the <em>first</em> time) is to publicly air their relationship problems at school, after which he continues to neglect her and fails to tell Elle they want space even when Rachel gives him an ultimatum. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's unsurprising that Rachel dumps him, only for them to get back together after Elle sets them up to smooch at the kissing booth...even though this addresses none of the problems they've been having</span>.

<ul><li> When Edward leaves Bella in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">New Moon</a></em>, she goes into a catatonic state for months and is slowly restored to normal only with the help of her best friend Jacob, who is also in love with her. After Edward returns, she takes him back as if nothing had happened. Really, there are quite a few points in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> where many readers were left wondering why Bella puts up with Edward. He frequently belittles, controls, and manipulates her well into the last book, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr">she hardly ever calls him on it</a>. In one memorable scene, Bella comes back from a shopping trip and full-out admits to herself that she knows that Edward will be breaking into her car and checking her odometer to see if she told him the truth about where she went out to.
<ul><li> Bella can be pretty emotionally manipulative to Edward too, though not anywhere near as bad as he is to her. The mere idea that they might break up causes her to flip out and she makes him promise that he will never hurt or leave her as long as she wants him around. During their temporary break-up in <em>New Moon</em>, she puts herself in several life-threatening situations because she doesn't want to live if she can't have him. When they do get back together, she feels the need to bring up her exploits on quite a few occasions and unleashes the guilt trip. She treats it as if it would have been HIS fault if she killed herself because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">it's clearly entirely his fault that she wasn't able to handle the break-up</a>. Never mind that the only reason he broke up with her was for her safety.
<ul><li> She does the same thing about sex and wanting to become a vampire. It would be decent of her to respect Edward's desire not to have sex before marriage and stop constantly pushing him because he did explain that it was important to him. If the genders were reversed and <em>he</em> was pressuring <em>her</em> for sex, even with Edward's stalking and controlling behaviour, Bella would probably be seen as the bigger creep.
</li></ul></li><li> Also played with when it comes to Jacob Black. He's introduced as one of the nicest and out-and-out most good people in the series, who is actually friends with Bella due to common interests and helped bring her out of her depressive shell after Edward ran off in <em>New Moon</em>. Jacob eventually develops feelings for Bella, but she's still hung up on Edward, and the moment he re-enters her life she drops Jacob. That's when his ugly side starts coming through since he gets insanely jealous of Edward on numerous occasions and tends to take his jealousy out on Bella. He forces her to kiss him three times in <em>Eclipse</em> with a not-so-subtle rape overtone to the interactions and in <em>Breaking Dawn</em> he gets so angry with her that he starts to violently shake her, resulting in Edward AND Jacob's own pack having to intervene.

Then there's Christian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">stalking</a> Ana and trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">control</a> all aspects of her life, which she finds irritating at <em>best</em>. However, at the start of the next book, Christian tells Ana he's changed and wants her back to have a 'vanilla' relationship. Even though it's been a mere five days and Ana has no proof of Christian's claims, she takes him back almost instantly.

The book is about a woman, Paige, who leaves her doctor husband Nicholas and young son because her mother did the same and she didn't know how to mother. On Nicholas' point of view, why would you take back a woman who just leaves a young baby with and doesn't come back for two months? On Paige's side, why would you get back with someone who was ready to divorce you and get a restraining order?

However, <em>Collateral Damage</em> either reveals or retcons this by saying that Paula did not actually take Karl back so much as the US government pretty much dumping him into her hands! Karl happens to be best pals with the President of the United States, as well as his National Security Advisor. It is not clear if the government knew what Karl was doing, or if they turned a blind eye to it, but it certainly makes the government come off as stupid and thoughtless. Karl did have to resign thanks to becoming wheelchair-bound. Paula ends up taking great pleasure tormenting him for all the years he tormented her! Not once does divorce or seeing a psychologist come up in any of this, not once!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Crescendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Crescendo">Crescendo</a></em> has Nora and Patch serve as this for each other. On one hand, Patch is creepy, smug, has few issues with using his powers to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> Nora and flat-out admitted in the previous book that he first knew of her because he decided to stalk her to kill her for his own benefit. Anyone would think Nora would be well-off to be rid of him, but she does nothing but whine and cry over how much she misses him. On the other hand, Nora goes straight into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> territory, screaming at Patch for so much as talking about another girl (a girl Nora has a bad history with, granted, but Patch is trying to discuss something serious), stalking <em>him</em> after breaking up with him, planning to have sex with a drunk friend to spite him, and stealing the diary of a girl she thinks Patch is dating, because clearly that's the best way to verify the information. Most people would see that behavior as a sign to get away as quickly as possible, but Patch seems to find it irritating at worst and <em>amusing</em> more often than not.
</li><li> A lot of people felt this about Twigbranch and Finleap in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em>, after Finleap pressured Twigbranch (who is still a very young warrior) into having children with him, threatening to leave the Clan if she refused, and acting cruelly to her when Twigbranch called him out on it.
</li><li> In <em>Laura Dean Keeps Breaking Up with Me</em>, Freddy keeps getting back together with the titular Laura Dean in spite of Laura selfishly breaking her heart over and over again. Unlike many other examples of this trope, however, the narrative is very aware that Freddy really <em>shouldn't</em> be taking Laura back and the entire plot is about her slowly coming to realize that she shouldn't stay in a toxic relationship just because she loves the other person.

</li><li> Buffy's souled boyfriends weren't much better. Angel lost his soul, went on to try and kill Buffy and her friends, and yet when he got his soul back Buffy decided to get back together with him (despite the risk of him losing his soul again and when he was <em>saying to her face</em> that he wants to sleep with her and doesn't care if it'll cost him his soul). Riley seemed nice to begin with but when he went to the vampire equivalent of a brothel in order to get bitten because he felt Buffy wasn't paying enough attention to him (when she was protecting her sister from a Hellgod and thought her mother was dying), Buffy dumps him... only to be convinced by Xander five minutes later that she should go after him because he's a "once in a lifetime guy" (when by this point he's done pretty much everything to prove that he's the total opposite). Buffy's taste in men <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorJudgeOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorJudgeOfCharacter">just kind of sucks in general</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Lily dumps Marshall shortly before their wedding and runs off to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanFrancisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanFrancisco">San Francisco</a> at the end of season 1 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>. She returns, begging forgiveness at the beginning of Season II. To the show's credit, the damage she caused Marshall isn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Waved</a>, and she spends much of the beginning of season 2 getting back into Marshall and Ted's good graces. But since the show is told in flashback, we already know Marsh and Lily end up together.
<ul><li> Done particularly well in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a> after they get back together. Lily is cleaning up, plugs the answering machine back in, and hears Ted calling her an offensive word in an old message for Marshal (left during the break-up period). Ted tries to apologize and explain, but Lily won't hear it, so he takes back the apology and calls her out on abandoning not just Marshal, but him and all their friends, and never having apologized to Ted about the way she acted.
</li><li> It's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> that Marshall's mother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObnoxiousInLaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObnoxiousInLaws">never forgave Lily for this</a>.
</li><li> The rest of the group asks this of Ted when he considers getting back together with Zoey at the end of season 6. You know, the woman who tried to destroy your career, manipulated you, lied to you, and secretly taped your conversations so that she could screw you over? Why <em>wouldn't</em> you take her back?
<ul><li> It goes both ways. Throughout the season, Zoey fought as hard as possible to prevent the destruction of the Arcadian Building. After she finally manages to convince Ted to agree to help her, he ends up betraying her at the last second and ensuring the building's destruction. One has to wonder why would Zoey want to get back with Ted after what he did.
</li></ul></li><li> Robin and her ex-boyfriend Simon, who waited to dump her until after she helped him load all his band's equipment into his van and then told her he was leaving her for Louise Marsh because her parents had a pool. Despite all her friends telling her she shouldn't go back to him, she still does and at the end of the episode, Simon dumped her the same way he did the first time - after moving his band's equipment to his van and for the same girl, Louise Marsh, because now her parents have a Jacuzzi.
</li><li> Ted and Jeanette. Jeanette was a crazy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> who frequently broke Ted's things over minor offenses. After they break up, Ted wanted to get back together with her, much to the disappointment and frustration of his friends. Future!Ted admits this was a big mistake and their second break up ends with Jeanette setting most of Ted's belongings on fire.
<ul><li> Also lessened somewhat by various dialogues during this time. Ted admits on several occasions that his positive outlook on romance has been taken hits over the years, and he is starting to feel outright despair that he'll never find someone to love. Part of his thinking is that Jeanette obviously is attracted to him, so maybe he can make it work if he tries hard enough.
</li></ul></li><li> Barney and Robin. Barney lied consistently and didn't apologize for his lies simply stating the fact that the man who Robin fell in love with was a liar and that magic, lies, and illusions are part of his charm so she should just accept that. I'm paraphrasing of course. It was a clever way of getting her forgiveness without actually apologizing. He also did a cute magic trick with flowers so that makes all the lying okay. However, Barney addresses this at their wedding, where he makes only one vow— that he will never, ever lie to her.
</li><li> And finally, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ted and Robin in the finale. While a good point is made that Ted always had feelings for her, her behavior throughout the episode, which is basically tantamount to abandoning her friends because she was no longer comfortable with their dynamic, simply does not sit well with a lot of fans</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SexAndTheCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SexAndTheCity">Sex and the City</a></em> star Carrie is constantly taking back Mr. Big no matter how many times he bails on her or is an ass to her. In this case, it is presented more that she has a constant lust and chemistry with him that she knows rationally will not end well. Carrie's friends even call her out on it when she gets back with him the second time.
<ul><li> Carrie as well, when she cheats on Aiden with Big. Repeatedly and with no apparent sense of guilt. She does confess to Aiden, and begs him to forgive her, even saying "You <em>have</em> to forgive me!" He briefly takes her back after some hesitation due to her violating his trust once, but they end up breaking up permanently, probably in part because she never did anything to make him believe she was sincere.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars">Veronica Mars</a></em> reunited with her ex, Duncan Kane, despite the fact that he dumped her without an explanation, ignored her every time she asked him why, and sat idly by as their peer group turned on her.

But that's a whole different issue)</span>. Granted, it doesn't last. Mostly because she fell for Duncan's best friend, Logan Echols - the son of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the man who murdered Lily Kane, Veronica's best friend</span> and one of the ringleaders of the "Treat Veronica Like Trash" brigade, and the same guy who had been starting to sexually assault her with a bunch of other guys before Duncan saved her. This is a non-issue to her for some reason.
</li><li> Played with when it comes to Phoebe/Cole on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em>, as after Phoebe kills Cole to vanquish The Source of All Evil inside him, he steals powers from the Demonic Wasteland to return to life and get back with Phoebe, only to have her keep saying, "You're evil, you're evil, you're evil." This is a guy who became a DA to put criminals in jail and counter the demonic side he was born with, helped Phoebe escape the Underworld, ultimately had his demonic side vanquished, became The Source only as a side effect of helping slay the previous Source, came back from the dead solely because of his love for Phoebe and kept trying to prove he was a good person, only giving up completely after she and her sisters tried to kill him again. There's a reason many fans referred to Phoebe as Phoe Me after Season Five, and in this case, the main question fans had was why Cole would take her back.
</li><li> Leo on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace">Will &amp; Grace</a></em>. He keeps leaving on doctor's missions in Africa after marrying Grace, pays her no attention when she finally decides to go with him, and cheats on her after she leaves, leading to their divorce. She keeps going back to him and ultimately has his baby.
</li><li> The writers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl">Gossip Girl</a></em> managed to turn their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperCouple">Super Couple</a> into this. Most fans still want Chuck and Blair to get back together, but it's difficult to see how Blair will be able to forgive Chuck for selling her to his creepy uncle in exchange for a hotel.
<ul><li> Somehow they actually managed to turn it around into fans questioning why <em>Chuck</em> would ever take <em>Blair</em> back. This due to massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> on his part while she became increasingly self-centered and unlikable. Also, that he was a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr">Love Martyr</a> for her for several seasons while she constantly toyed with his emotions.
</li><li> Serena took back <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass">Dan</a> after he admitted he had been trying to make her fall in love with him again so he would be able to gain material to <em>write an article about it trashing her publicly</em>. He didn't go through it and Serena's taste of men had already been proven to be... debatable, but still. Also, platonically, the rest of the gang to Dan after he was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">revealed to be Gossip Girl</span>.
</li><li> In a platonic sense, Serena and Blair, frequently to each other.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DegrassiTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DegrassiTheNextGeneration">Degrassi: The Next Generation</a></em> Johnny DiMarco dumps Alli because he doesn't want to admit to Holly J that he's dating a ninth-grader. She takes him back after this and continues to pine after him.
<ul><li> Also, Ashley takes Craig back after he cheats on her with Manny and attempts to justify it by calling her a prude.
</li><li> Terri gets back with Rick because he apologized for abusing her.
</li><li> Mia gets back with Lucas who blew her off the second she got pregnant, several years prior.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em>, when Niles' marriage to Maris begins falling apart, there are several occasions where Maris tries to win him back, often causing Martin and Frasier to pretty much ask this question. Differs in that Niles generally listens to them, or had concluded that he didn't want to get back with her on his own after the first time he did take her back right at the end of their marriage, only for her to promptly turn around and cheat on him with their marriage counselor. This was the straw that broke the camel's back, and he never seriously considered taking her back again. Later on, when they've almost finalized their divorce, Maris begs him once again to reconcile, sending him gifts and love letters, only for him to explicitly invoke this trope to her face. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">She tries to sue him for every cent he has in retaliation.</a> Yeah, there's a reason the writers felt there was no way any actress could do her character justice. Of course <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">Jerkass Has a Point</a> and it's unclear why she wants <em>him</em> back; he's been emotionally unfaithful and pursuing Daphne for years by the first time she cheats on him (it's actually the crux of the lawsuit, and he only gets out of it through blackmail).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> during a flash-forward Jack, while engaged to and living with Kate, has a bad day. He then goes home, sends the nanny home early, and proceeds to get drunk and high while home alone with her adopted three-year-old son. When she gets home he demands to know where she's been. She tells him she's been doing something for Sawyer, his former romantic rival, but won't tell him what it is out of loyalty to him. Jack yells at her, telling her that Sawyer "chose" to stay on the island and it was Jack who saved her. In a later episode, we learn that is patently untrue. Sawyer jumped out of the chopper because it was too heavy and swam back to the island. He had no reason to believe that they would not be able to come back for him. And then, to cap off the argument, when Kate tells him quite reasonably that if he has a drug problem he needs to leave and get help because she can't have him like that around her son, he yells at her, telling her that he's not really her son, she's not even related to him, with the implied meaning that because he is Aaron's biological uncle, he has more of a right to raise him than her, even though she's been mothering him since he was a few months old and clearly loves him and only wants what's best for him. In the show's end she tells him she loves him and they get back together in the afterlife.
<ul><li> Also worthy of mention, one night, post-breakup, Kate shows up in Jack's bed, lying practically catatonic. He asks her what happened to Aaron and she tells him to never mention Aaron to her again. It's clear that she's gone through something traumatic. She kisses him and he doesn't stop her. He proceeds to take advantage of her exceedingly vulnerable state and has sex with her. He also shows no concern for what happened to his nephew.
</li></ul></li><li> In the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>, Finn breaks up with Quinn once he realises that she lied to him about him being the father of her baby, and the fact that she cheated on him with his best friend. So, when he breaks up with Rachel in season two and actually gets back together with Quinn, his excuse of "when we kissed, there were fireworks" just doesn't seem good enough to justify it. The trope is played with when Finn admits that he doesn't really trust Quinn AT ALL due to her track record (she cheated on Finn with Puck, and in getting together with Finn, she cheated on Sam) and that he can't quite justify why he's actually with her again. This trope could also be applied with Finn and Rachel since they break up and get back together more times than you can count, and they usually break up over something stupid - the break up that caused Finn to date Quinn again, for example, was caused when Rachel found out that Finn lost his virginity to Santana (while they weren't together, mind), and she decided to cheat on him with Puck to get her own back. The audience <em>knows</em> that they're going to keep getting back together, but you have to wonder why they keep doing it.
<ul><li> Then we see the example invoked with Jesse St. James. Jesse was a mole for Shelby Corcoran, who wanted Jesse to reveal indirectly that Shelby is Rachel's biological mother. After he transferred to New Directions, he briefly dated Rachel, only to go back to Vocal Adrenaline the minute she learned the VA coach was her mother, and lured her for the VA team to egg her. While it's implied his teammates forced him to hurt Rachel, it does not excuse <em>any</em> of his actions. Unsurprisingly, the entire Glee club in season two is <em>furious</em> at Jesse when he's hired to offer feedback. Kurt bluntly tells Rachel that Jesse didn't love her, he "made breakfast on her head". It's not like Jesse even has the decency to apologize to the team he betrayed and tries to suck up to Rachel. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The only sensible thing she does that season is turn him down. Jesse has to wait several years for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> to kick in, to prove to Rachel that he is truly sorry</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrRobot">Mr. Robot</a></em>, Angela starts to blatantly psychologically abuse Elliot and work with Mr. Robot behind his back to make Stage 2 successful. Justified that she was brainwashed by Whiterose, this doesn't ignore the fact that she badly treated Elliot throughout the majority of the season, and before that, she didn't give him the care that he needed. And when he found out about her betrayal, she ignored the accusations as if she doesn't remember doing this to him, didn't care about the fact that he was heartbroken and upset and pushed him away after she was done with him. Despite the hell she put him through, he still forgave her even if she didn't apologize to him. Unfortunately, Angela later accuses him of manipulating her after seeing Leon in his apartment when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">she herself did the same thing to him</a>. So it's unknown if Elliot will ever take her back.

Granted, it's a time machine, so she should have no trouble making it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">back in time</a> for the wedding, so that's not TOO bad... until she kisses and attempts to seduce the Doctor. Even this alone wouldn't be quite enough to qualify for this trope — relationships can survive infidelity — but Rory has to hear about it from the Doctor, not Amy, and she never apologizes or takes <em>any</em> responsibility for her attempted dalliance. When confronted, her response is along the lines of, "Well, we never really <em>did</em> anything." Right...only that's because the Doctor rejected her, not for lack of trying on her part. In fact, the Doctor made Rory a companion specifically because it was making him extremely uncomfortable. Rory expresses understandable concern about the lack of loyalty his prospective wife displays, but being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">Extreme Doormat</a> that he is, nothing ever comes of it, and the whole incident is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">seldom mentioned again</a>.

Yet the <em>moment</em> Thomas finds out Grace is in the UK, he instantly tries to get her back, even when she expresses reluctance at leaving her husband and reveals she's trying for a baby with him.

It seems even the writers predicted how the audience would react to this — the following episode of <em>Arrow</em>, "Irreconcilable Differences", forcibly shilled how "in love" Oliver and Felicity were, as if they were trying to convince the fans of that fact.

</li><li> In "Escape", aka "The Pina Colada Song", the protagonist is checking out personal ads in the middle of the night while his girlfriend is sleeping because he was "tired of my lady". He answers the ad, only to find out it was placed by his girlfriend. Not only were the two completely willing to cheat on each other with complete strangers, they apparently had never even bothered to discuss things they like to do with each other.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MuchAdoAboutNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MuchAdoAboutNothing">Much Ado About Nothing</a></em>'s (allegedly) main plot has Claudio, with no faith in Hero and only the most superficial idea of love for her, but their reconciliation is meant to be a good thing anyway. After the Friar's speech, though, the Friar-suggested <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme">Zany Scheme</a> goes into full effect and Claudio realizes that he truly did love Hero to the point where he happily takes her back in the finale. Much of this trope is invoked if Claudio overplays the pivotal moments in Act 4, Scene 1 - if he's being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> there, it's understandable, but if he's playing a deceived man who shall punish himself further, then it averts this trope. Definitely depends on the actor portraying Claudio.
<ul><li> The BBC series <em>Shakespeare Re-told</em> didn't change that much of the politically incorrect <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTamingOfTheShrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTamingOfTheShrew">The Taming of the Shrew</a></em>, they did change the ending of their adaptation of <em>Much Ado About Nothing</em> because the way Claudio attacks Hero and shames her in front of her family is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">really beyond the pale</a>. Specifically, Hero <em>doesn't</em> take Claude back after he humiliates her in front of her friends and family.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TwoGentlemenOfVerona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TwoGentlemenOfVerona">Two Gentlemen of Verona</a></em> has Julia taking Proteus back at the end. This is after he completely forgets about her after meeting his best friend Valentine's girlfriend Silvia, causes Valentine to be banished by telling the Duke about their plan to elope, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">tries to rape Silvia</a></em>. Julia is present for all of this, disguised as a man. Overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">easily forgiven</a>, since not only does Valentine forgiven Proteus, he <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">offers Julia to him</a></em>.

The entire point of the play is that Bertram is an insufferable boor who reneges on his promise and gives a series of impossible demands on his betrothed. Then, at the climax when she reveals that she has completed his impossible tasks (which included pretending to be another woman so she could get pregnant with his child), he somehow declares that he loves her. The only sympathetic version that I've seen has him get seriously injured in between the last two scenes, giving a reason for his change of heart.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheWintersTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheWintersTale">The Winter's Tale</a></em> is worst of all. King Leontes, from out of nowhere and with absolutely <em>no</em> evidence, suddenly becomes convinced that his faithful wife Hermione is cheating on him with his old friend King Polixenes. Dead set on believing the worst of his wife despite all the world around him telling he's dead wrong, Leontes' mad efforts to prove Hermione unfaithful lead to their son Mamillius <em>deliberately starving himself to death out of heartbreak over his father's actions,</em> their second child Perdita <em>being abandoned to die in another country,</em> and Hermione herself apparently dying from grief and shock over Mamillius' death. Finally, after his cruel foolishness costs him everything, Leontes belatedly realizes just how badly he's messed things up and is subsequently left alone to grieve over how much he's ruined his own, once happy life. Yet years later, Hermione and Perdita are miraculously restored to him, and neither woman shows <em>any</em> hatred or bitterness toward the man who tried to destroy them. This is treated as a happy ending for all three of them—but while Perdita forgiving her father is more understandable, given that she was only a baby when he tried to kill her and therefore has no memory of the actual events, Hermione's attitude is much more baffling, especially given that they'll always have the death of Mamillius between them. Given all that he put her through, it makes one wonder why Hermione doesn't leave him for good.
</li><li> Originally averted in Ibsen's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ADollsHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ADollsHouse">A Doll's House</a></em>, in which after the conflict is settled, the lead character recognizes her husband's poor character and leaves him. However, Ibsen was forced to change the ending <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">because people were outraged by a wife leaving</a>. The changed ending has Nora fighting with her husband and is then led to her children, where she collapses and decides to stay, playing this trope straight. At least one contemporary troupe reverted to the original after public protest; it's fair to say the altered ending isn't produced much these days.
</li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMarriageOfFigaro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMarriageOfFigaro">The Marriage of Figaro</a></em>, after the Count has been shown up by Figaro, Susanna, and Countess Rosina, he asks his wife to forgive him. She does. This despite the fact that:
<dl><dd><ul><li> He's been chasing after another woman for most of the opera,
</li><li> He's had enough of an affair with Barbarina, a servant girl, that she's able to blackmail him,
</li><li> He's repeatedly tried to ruin the wedding of Susanna, the Countess's best friend and confidante, besides attempting to blackmail her into sleeping with him,
</li><li> The guy whom Susanna loves and wants to marry is actually Figaro, who in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheBarberOfSeville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheBarberOfSeville">The Barber of Seville</a> was <em>the person who helped the Count to marry his wife</em> and is now the Count's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo">Number Two</a>
</li><li> The Countess sunk to the new low of having to conspire with <em>servants</em> to teach him a lesson, which was pretty... bad in said cases <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">(seriously, she actually has a song about how terrible this is)</a>
</li><li> And let's <em>not</em> forget that whole section in Act Two where he was trying to find out who was in her wardrobe, and calls her a <em>lot</em> of unpleasant names in the process as well as threatening to kill her (relatively) innocent godson Cherubino. Yes, he had a reason for it, and he does apologise for that one at the time, but that doesn't do much to excuse his behaviour (in some productions he even hits her!).
</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> All this means that, despite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> of the time the opera was written, she'd be perfectly within her rights to have him dance the humiliation conga some more. But, because she's 'kinder than him', she forgives him almost right off the bat. (One only wonders how long he's going to stay faithful <em>this</em> time...)
<ul><li> In Beaumarchais' third Figaro play <em>The Guilty Mother</em> (1792), which is set 20 years after the "Marriage", it turns out that in the interim the Countess had a son with Cherubin (who died in battle), while the Count had an illegitimate daughter. Wacky hijinks ensue, not least because the two children fall in love with each other. This third part of the trilogy, however, was only turned into an opera in 1966 (by Darius Milhaud).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AStreetcarNamedDesire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AStreetcarNamedDesire">A Streetcar Named Desire</a></em>, Stella runs off from Stanley after he beats her up, however, seconds after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureScene">that</a></em> scene, she runs back to him. Blanche calls her out for it and even asks her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoesSheSeeInHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoesSheSeeInHim">what she sees in him</a>. It's been implied that this happened several times, and further that Stella is almost <em>excited</em> by his violent actions toward her. The film subverts it as in the end, she runs off from Stanley after what he did to Blanche. It's worth noting, though, that the <em>only</em> reason the ending was changed in the movie was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">because the Hayes Code of Conduct, which ruled Hollywood at the time, had to see Stanley punished for his actions.</a>

<ul><li> Any episode where Marge considers leaving Homer only to take him back.

Lovejoy agrees with her. Homer throws back the fish he caught and that is enough to make up for everything else, as the two happily head home. This was <em>seasons</em> before he became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>. While the fish was meant to be a symbol that he actually <em>did</em> love her more than anything else, the example still holds up. It also goes both ways. Marge has repeatedly done things to Homer that show her to be petty and vindictive, and with a bit of a wandering heart/eye.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> has Homer's selfish behavior finally catch up with him, with Marge taking the kids and leaving, even recording a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DearJohnLetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DearJohnLetter">"Dear John" message</a> <em>over the video of their wedding</em>.

Then they have eight babies, which is understandably stressful.

There's also the fact that any time Homer is involved in a plot where it looks like he may cheat, he's incredibly upset at the prospect, whereas Marge was actually <em>contemplating</em> cheating on Homer with Jacques.

Depictions set chronologically after the series in the DCAU do show that she ends up finally realizing how bad the relationship is after a stint in jail and permanently leaves the Joker as part of her attempt to go legit.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em> gives us Oskar and Suzie Kokoshka. Suzie works hard, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">Oskar</a> is consistently unemployed, whiny, and only cares about himself. Many times she has attempted to walk out on him, but she always comes back. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnoldTheJungleMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnoldTheJungleMovie">Hey Arnold! The Jungle Movie</a></em>, however, Suzie is nowhere to be seen, and Craig Bartlett would later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">confirm in a Reddit AMA</a> that Suzie had indeed divorced and left Oskar by that point.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>: Asami has her heart broken by Mako in Book 1 where he develops feelings for Korra while in a relationship with Asami. Mako, in general, is a poor boyfriend; he hides the fact that he and Korra kissed (to be fair, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcefulKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcefulKiss">Korra started that one</a>) and is shown to be much more emotionally invested in Korra. They break up at the season finale, with Mako <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">getting together</a> with Korra. After Mako breaks up with Korra, he and Asami get back together in less than a <em>week</em>. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> because Asami was just robbed of her last chance of saving her family's business and really needed some emotional support. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverted</a> when Mako fails to tell an amnesiac Korra that they broke up, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking">destroying</a> his relationship with both girls. This sticks, and by the end of the series, Mako is the only main character not in a relationship. The recap episode just before the end has other characters ruthlessly mock Mako for how poorly he handled all of this. Asami and Korra's relationship <em>does</em> manage to stay intact, however, and they end up falling in love with each other by the finale.
