</p><p>It's an interesting phenomenon: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a> is generally presented as an admirable figure, or at least benign, even in non-Christian or <em>anti</em>-Christian media. Atheists, Jews, Buddhists, cynics — anyone who might author stories unflattering in their portrayal of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil">the Almighty</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsWrong">religion in general</a> — are nonetheless complimentary to that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJewishBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJewishBoy">Nice Jewish Boy</a>. This can be used as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> to Christianity ("Jesus was cool even if his followers all suck"), but also as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> moment from a character who is otherwise portrayed as villainous and/or hostile to the status quo ("<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealMenLoveJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealMenLoveJesus">Even Bad Men Love Their Jesus</a>"). This makes sense, in a way. Jesus was supposed to be God in mortal form, and as such, having a sense of humor is possible, if not probable.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>This is not always received well. Portraying Jesus as a cool dude can somewhat dent his gravitas as a religious figurehead, and as a result some Christians can get offended by (what they consider to be) the trivialization of their Lord and Savior. There's also the fact that Jesus is a figure in Islam as well, and general Islamic sentiment is that prophets are sacred and should not be portrayed. Others may note that Jesus is Way Cool because he happens to agree with the writer on all sorts of subjects, even those where all the evidence is the other way round. On the other hand, when employed in works that try to play up Christianity as being "cool" by association, it generally gets a free pass. Always remember that tropes are neither inherently good nor inherently bad, just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">tools</a>.
</p><p>The trope is usually associated with atheistic former Christians who are attempting to dissociate themselves from Christianity, but still have issues with it, and therefore need to view/depict Christ as a sympathetic figure, in order to obtain integration, resolution, and catharsis; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSmith">Kevin Smith</a>'s example (from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogma">Dogma</a></em>, as shown in the trope photo) is quintessential of this, as was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>'s attempt to basically include Jesus as a member of their community. In these cases, it can overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodBeforeDogma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodBeforeDogma">God Before Dogma</a>: their issue isn't necessarily with the Lord Himself, just with religious doctrines or practices done in His name.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Nevertheless, the trope actually does have some genuine theological support insofar as Jesus is depicted as being allowed to drink wine, and tended to associate with the outcast and marginalised members of society, like prostitutes, people found guilty of adultery, tax collectors, and various other types who were considered unsavoury by the religious authorities of the day. He also had a pronounced anti-authoritarian streak, regularly calling out religious leaders for hypocrisy and acting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou">Holier Than Thou</a>. Several portions of the Bible also portrays him as master of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalJudo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalJudo">Verbal Judo</a> and an expert in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamingTheMob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamingTheMob">Shaming the Mob</a>, which undeniably gives him an air of being an accomplished <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassPacifist">Badass Pacifist</a>. And last, but certainly not least, there are also the facts that Jesus' whole ethos is bound up on the idea that he is the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">All-Loving Hero</a> who will offer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Forgiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Forgiveness">Forgiveness</a> to all who willingly seek it, no matter how great their crime or transgression, and that is his whole mission is being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParagon">The Paragon</a> who will lead humanity unto a better path. These are all traits that are highly likely to find <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesResonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesResonance">Values Resonance</a> across time periods and cultural differences. Study of the New Testament (and the non-canon Gospels) will tend to show Christ as much less severe than he is sometimes depicted by certain church authorities, who have been known to (ironically) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuoteMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuoteMine">misuse his words</a> with an eye on political and social control.

When people philosophize about imitating him, it often overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatWouldXDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatWouldXDo">What Would X Do?</a>. A supertrope to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsWizardJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsWizardJesus">No Such Thing as Wizard Jesus</a> (Jesus is always special, even if there are individuals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> who are capable of matching or exceeding his own supernatural feats) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsSpaceJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsSpaceJesus">No Such Thing as Space Jesus</a> (one part this to one part <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreSpecial">Humans Are Special</a>).

<ul><li> In the manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintYoungMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintYoungMen">Saint Young Men</a></em>, Jesus and Buddha are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PalsWithJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PalsWithJesus">best buddies</a> living in Tokyo and generally enjoying the human world on their vacation, doing such mundane things as going to convenience stores, taking the train and buying souvenirs. Even though Jesus is depicted as a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">Bunny-Ears Lawyer</a>, it's affectionate rather than insulting.
</li><li> Even a work as disturbing as <em>Arm of Kannon</em> gave props to Jesus. He was apparently one of the very few people who could contain one of the eponymous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PiecesOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PiecesOfGod">Pieces of God</a> without losing control. The way it's portrayed is incredibly awesome too. Jesus calmly faced the out of control Arm which had taken on the form of a rampaging dragon and offered it a home inside him. <em>Jesus stared down a dragon and peacefully subdued it.</em>
</li><li> While she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaughtyNuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaughtyNuns">may not exactly follow her vows</a>, Eda of the Church of Violence seems to believe this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em>. She refers to Jesus as a trickster who turned water into wine.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GarthEnnis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GarthEnnis">Garth Ennis</a>, well-known for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens">Rage Against the Heavens</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil">God Is Evil</a> stories, sympathetically portrays Jesus in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheChroniclesOfWormwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheChroniclesOfWormwood">Chronicles of Wormwood</a></em>. Jesus, or "Jay", is the African-American best friend of the titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAntiChrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAntiChrist">Anti Anti Christ</a> (both sons who hate their dads), who suffered brain damage from police brutality while protesting the Iraq War, and who has suffered psychologically for centuries from his overwhelming desire to do good.
<ul><li> In another Ennis-written example, the demon Hoss tells <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GhostRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GhostRider">Ghost Rider</a> a story that strongly implies that Jesus's message of forgiveness and love was distorted by demonic interference so that it became one of "pain an' sacrifice an' guilt...just another damn religion." The same comic features a ruthless, mass-murdering, child-killing archangel as Heaven's agent on Earth and two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a> lesser angels in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelestialBureaucracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelestialBureaucracy">Celestial Bureaucracy</a> only out to save their own bacon, suggesting that Jesus was a major exception to the usual way of doing business Up There.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Valerian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Valerian">Valérian</a></em> the Son is the most laid-back member of the Trinity of Hypsis, taking the form of a guitar-playing, weed-smoking hippie with stigmata.

</li><li> Underground comic artist Frank Stack (aka Foolbert Sturgeon) did a few comic books with Jesus in the present day, quietly (mostly) observing humanity's less than stellar actions.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Spawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Spawn">Spawn</a></em>, God and Satan, though neither are particularly malevolent toward anyone but each other, are portrayed as essentially bratty teenagers on a cosmic scale. Jesus, on the other hand, is not God's son, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>His mother</em>, and the true Creator of the universe. She (the entity is technically genderless, but usually given feminine attributes) incarnated herself on Earth in an attempt to make humanity better than her children. As can be imagined given this goal, religious fundamentalism gets her down.</span>
<ul><li> Incidentally, Spawn's creator and head writer Todd McFarlane is an atheist. Speaks to his respect of the guy.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Italian satiric comic <em>Jenus of Nazareth</em>, Jesus got an amnesia because during the second coming he received a flesh and blood body while he was still falling on Earth, and has become arrogant and foul mouthed, but is still a good and fun guy, and willing to bust up asses to help people. His reaction to finding out that the Catholic Church was using his name to enrich themselves? <em>Kick the Pope and all his cardinals out of the Vatican for occupying his house without authorization and being assholes, and beat the stuff out of them when they try and resist</em>.

He remains in one scene where people mishear the Sermon on the Mount (which He is delivering straight), which basically epitomizes the real theme of the movie: the conflict between what Jesus said and what certain people thought (and still think) they heard.

Oddly, despite the cynicism of the move, Cardinal Glick's stated reasoning was sound: the symbol of Christianity being the cross was, to him, "wholly depressing".

</li><li> Jesus was also mentioned several times by Rufus over the course of the movie, including <em>agreeing</em> with Glick, if not explicitly or by the same reasoning, that there is an issue with Catholics "mourning" their faith. While other parts of the movie parody different parts of religion, specific references to Jesus himself pretty much match what's written in the Bible. From the descriptions, Jesus seems to have been fairly laid back (he apparently owes Rufus twelve dollars) and enjoyed listening to people talk more than anything else.
<div class="indent"><strong>Rufus:</strong> He likes to listen to people talk. Says it sounds like music to Him. Christ loved to sit around the fire and listen to me and the other guys. Whenever we were going on about unimportant shit, He always had a smile on His face.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/MrDeity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/MrDeity">Mr Deity</a></em> series, Jesus isn't perfect, but he's almost always standing up for the general good of humanity and objecting to particularly unreasonably aspects of the way his father does things. Out of Mr. Deity (God), Larry (archangel), Lucy (devil and Mr. Deity's girlfriend), and Jesus, who are the four main characters, Jesus generally gets portrayed as being more concerned with doing good than the other three and more reasonable than Mr. Deity.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSalvationWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSalvationWar">The Salvation War</a></em>, Jesus is definitely cool. He realizes how insane his father is well before anyone else and tries three times to help humanity (Jesus, Mohamed, and someone else, possibly Joan of Arc or Martin Luther), but after these attempts backfire and he sees how rapidly they are progressing, he decides to see what they can do to correct the injustices done to them on their own. Even after Michael the Angelic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> sets him up to die by nuclear weapon, he still forgives him because he understands his motivation for doing so.

</li></ul></li><li> <em>The Devil's Panties</em> has "J.C.", who often hangs out with the comic's version of its creator Jennie Breeden.

</li><li> The now-discontinued <em>Lowroad 75</em> featured Jesus in a few episodes. In one, the main character and her boyfriend were surrounded by ads for Christmas shopping ("Buy crap!

He first came to train the cast to fight against Larxene (much to Marluxia's disappointment, who wanted a hot Latino). He later shows up to officiate over Axel and Aerith's wedding, for an "Old Testament" drinking party with Axel and Zexion, and most recently has joined Axel, Zexion, Riku, and Marluxia to fix the timestream.
</li><li> Sandra from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SandraAndWoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SandraAndWoo">Sandra and Woo</a></em> thinks that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sandraandwoo.com/2009/11/30/0116-jesus-of-nazareth/">Jesus was a swell guy, but she can't stand his fanboys.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

Has an apparent tendency to answer all questions of morality with, "What would <strong>I</strong> do?" (much to the annoyance of divine beings looking for a little guidance). God has a similarly laid-back personality.
</li><li> Jesus first appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Shortpacked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Shortpacked">Shortpacked!</a></em> as a hallucination after Robin gets a nasty knock on the head. Eventually, he becomes a background cast member (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Galasso <em>resurrects him</em></span>). Though he has a much darker skin tone than generally depicted and referred to as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">the Historical Jesus</a>," he's also portrayed as a friendly man who spends most of his time promising nice customers that kindness is always rewarded.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BrunoTheBandit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BrunoTheBandit">Bruno the Bandit</a></em> portrays Ailix, the local equivalent of Jesus, as this. He was the physical incarnation of the Creator Of the Universe, and his teachings became the foundation of The Church of The Blessed Ailix, which unfortunately warped into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch">Corrupt Church</a> with a greedy leadership only interested in filling their own pockets. The Pope himself is only a figurehead for the rich and powerful, to the point that when the current Pope is convinced by a manifestation of Ailix to renounce his riches and become a true, inspiring leader of the Church, he's immediately forced to step down by the other officials who dont WANT Ailix followers to follow his example. Yeah, the comic got rather Anvilicious towards the end.

<ul><li> He makes a similar point <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/KAvDtPz33w0">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

<div class="indent">"We're more popular than Jesus now; I don't know which will go first-rock 'n' roll or Christianity. <strong>Jesus was all right but his disciples were thick and ordinary.</strong> It's them twisting it that ruins it for me."
</div></li><li> Although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FriedrichNietzsche" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FriedrichNietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> dismissed Christianity in general as conducive to "slave morality", he viewed Jesus as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a> and as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ubermensch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ubermensch">Übermensch</a> who radically changed the views of society. He says (in a book entitled <em>The Anti-Christ</em>) that "the last Christian died on the Cross."
</li><li> Prominent anarchist speaker and writer Emma Goldman had nothing good to say about religion, but stated in at least one essay ("Minorities Versus Majorities") that she respected Jesus for going against the dominant powers of his day and didn't entirely disagree with his teachings — just with the people who blindly follow them and use their religion as an excuse to persecute others.
</li><li> Averted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GKChesterton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GKChesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a>, of all people. As he says in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/everlasting_man.html#chap-II-ii">The Everlasting Man<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> "The truth is that it is the image of Christ in the churches that is almost entirely mild and merciful. It is the image of Christ in the Gospels that is a good many other things as well...The Church can reasonably be justified therefore if she turns the most merciful face or aspect towards men; but it is certainly the most merciful aspect that she does turn....A man simply taking the words of the story as they stand would form quite another impression; an impression full of mystery and possibly of inconsistency; but certainly not merely an impression of mildness." It should be noted that his point is <em>not</em> that Jesus was not kind and merciful, but that to anyone reading the Bible for the first time with no preconceptions about Jesus would see someone who was certainly not afraid to show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWouldntLikeMeWhenImAngry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWouldntLikeMeWhenImAngry">wrath</a>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/KN-8G0HCD5U">A rather famous 1980s skit<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RowanAtkinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RowanAtkinson">Rowan Atkinson</a> was based around presenting this trope as a sermon.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">     The Bible </div><div class="folder" id="folder16" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Here are some verifiable (Biblically-sourced, that is) facts about Human Body v2, post-Resurrection: the ability of either teleportation or phasing through solid matter (Jesus appearing in locked rooms), some degree of mental obfuscation (disciples at Emmaus), indestructible (1 Cor 15:42), immunity to psy-ops (Rev 21:4 - no pain, no sorrow, no sadness) and a guarantee that all genuine Christians get these upgrades. Yeah, this kinda body isn't that of a zombie, unless you're talking about Necrons. Specifically, Necron Flayers- with built-in warp-portal generators. badass enough yet?
</li><li> If you take one of the commonly held interpretations, Jesus was fully man though He was God in personality and being. Essentially, this means any human could do what He did if they were in tune enough with the will of God and faithful (as opposed to Him simply having the divine power while in mortal form). So Jesus's power would be based on sheer raw epic coolness. Corroborated after the whole telling the storm to shut up episode - he tells the disciples that "if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there' and it will move." <a class="urllink" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2017:20&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 17:20<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Which seems like hyperbole, but when you consider that he's proscribing physical dimensions to an intangible concept...
</li><li> By all biblical accounts, Jesus was a pretty cool guy. People really liked being around him, and whenever he spoke, it could attract a crowd of thousands in a time when numbers like that meant a good number of them had to travel great distances just to get there. The guy was great with kids (in a culture that hardly cared about them), and an amazing storyteller and healer.
</li><li> From the cultural perspective of Israel at that time, Jesus was an anti-establishment rebel who ran around with a gang of young men, trashed temples, and told everybody that everything they knew about righteousness and morality is wrong.
<ul><li> He even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNicknamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNicknamer">gave his gang members awesome nicknames</a>. Most famously, he gave Simon the name Petra (or Peter) which means "The Rock" in Greek. Oddly, no one translates it as "Simon called Rocky". St. Thomas' name is a nickname meaning "The Twin" (real name Judas) and the third Apostle named Judas got the nickname Thaddeus ("Braveheart"). The other is Simon "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">The Zealot</a>". He also renamed the sons of Zebedee the <em>Sons of Thunder.</em> How filthy a temper do you need to have for <em>Jesus</em> to be impressed by it? <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4l3ho');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4l3ho" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4l3ho');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Answer: They asked Him if He wanted them to call down fire from Heaven like Elijah when some people were being disrespectful. </span>
</li></ul></li><li> Jesus did not, as commonly believed, work as a carpenter. He built houses <em>out of stone</em>. He would have not been the thin meek figure commonly depicted. Now imagine him chasing the crooked money exchanges out of the temple... with a whip. When he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlippingTheTable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlippingTheTable">upending tables</a> consider that some historians have suggested that those tables, given the era, would have been marble.
</li><li> He later (1300 years, give or take) appears to Julian of Norwich (who 'wrote' "Revelations of Divine Love") and told her, after showing her multiple fairly horrific visions, that "It has been behooved that Sin should exist; but, All will be well, and All will be well and All Manner of Thing will be well..." which is the basic belief of Universalists (Julian was described as a Proto-Universalist) that, even the Traitor (Satan) can be given the chance, even in Hell to be redeemed and Return to Paradise with the Father. It's VERY cool.
</li><li> Jesus' got his first fan (John the Baptist) just minutes after being magically introduced in Mary's womb. From the other end of the life spectrum, if what Jesus said was the truth it changes from Jesus <strong>was</strong> (past tense, implying that Jesus is still dead) way cool to he <strong>is</strong> (Jesus is still with us) way cool. Being God is pretty cool.
</li><li> Jesus's first recorded miracle was the famous water-to-wine trick, which he performed at a wedding party. Which means that, even before he became famous for his teachings and other miraculous works (which really only covered the last three years of his life), he was still popular enough to be invited to those sorts of parties.
<ul><li> Not only that, but His first miracle wasn't for something of huge gravitas or detached from the common folk. He was only, at the behest of His mother, helping people have fun and enjoy themselves at a party. And, gravitas or not, this is both recorded in the Bible and very, <em>very</em> cool.
</li></ul></li><li> From the book of Matthew, the comment Jesus made when confronted with the rich man who asked him how to be saved, "Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God." The word translated "camel" here is <em>kamêlos</em>; this sounds a lot like the word <em>kamilos</em>, which refers to the end of a rope. A popular aphorism of the time referred to the unlikelihood of a particular event as "easier for a rope to go through the eye of a needle". Yes, our lord and saviour, as part of his lesson to his disciples, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">made an awful pun</a>.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder17');">     Other Religions' Interpretations </div><div class="folder" id="folder17" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuran">The Holy Quran</a>. Jesus could talk soon after he was born, and he wasn't killed-God raised him to the sky and tricked the Romans into crucifying someone else (often depicted as Judas or a criminal) in his place. Muslims generally regard Jesus as a great prophet second in holiness after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheProphetMuhammad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheProphetMuhammad">The Prophet Muhammad</a> himself (though they consider the idea of holding him as an actually divine being, the son of God, or even God Himself in human form as a grave <em>insult</em> against both God <em>and</em> Jesus). In fact, one of the many Hadiths about Judgment Day prophesies that Jesus will return to Earth as the Messiah to lead all true believers against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAntiChrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAntiChrist">The Anti-Christ</a> (called the "False Messiah/Dajjal" in Islam) and finally kill him, then reign over a long utopian realm on the otherwise gone-to-shit planet for a long time before the world finally comes to an end.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JewsLoveToArgue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JewsLoveToArgue">Jews vary a little more in how they see him.</a>
<ul><li> Obviously, most Jewish people don't believe that Jesus was actually a divine figure, but very few think that he was anything but a very good person. Most of their issues come from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfRevelation">Book of Revelation</a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2027:24-27:25&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 27:24-25<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Since the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, many Jewish scholars have started to renounce their hatred of Jesus and state that he was indeed a mensch because of his devotion to Judaism (he was technically a "better" Jew than Moses) and for being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJewishBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJewishBoy">Nice Jewish Boy</a>. It is instead, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul">Saint Paul</a> whom they <a class="urllink" href="http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/20214/who-was-paul">loathe<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. They think Paul and his gentile followers screwed things up through their ideas like rejection of Mosaic law <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5hakc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5hakc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5hakc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">although it's noted that even James the Just, who advocated the strongest for Jewish Christianity also suggested relaxing most of its tenets</span>, supersessionism, and institutionalising of anti-Judaism (and later anti-Semitism) in Christian tradition. Some more extreme views have called him the "world's first self-hating Jew" or the "founder of Jews for Jesus". Others state that Paul is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Misblamed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Misblamed">not at fault because he too has been misinterpreted</a> and <em>never</em> meant for any of this to happen (he was a highly educated Jew himself). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> has an <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle_and_Judaism">article dedicated to the relationship between Paul and Judaism<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Another Jewish perspective has a harsher view: claiming to be a prophet with the message that laws should be changed is heresy worthy of the death penalty, to say nothing of claiming to be the son of God. Just because they don't always say it loudly doesn't mean some Jews don't have issues with Jesus.
<ul><li> Such a position can be summed up with the phrase, "That which was good was not new, and that which was new was not good." Most of Jesus' moral teachings are generally regarded as mere repetition of well-known Jewish teachings, whilst all innovations - particularly the idea of Jesus having been divine - are seen as heresy and nonsense.
</li><li> You may notice that at least two Gospels have Jesus claiming he has <em>no</em> intention to change the laws. Of course, it is a well known fact that the attempts to preserve and restore are the ones that produce the greatest changes.
</li></ul></li><li> There were some Jews who avoided studying Torah on Christmas because to do so on someone's birthday honors them, something they were not comfortable doing. Instead, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">made toilet paper</a>.
</li><li> There are those (who you will also find among atheists) who think he was a nice guy, but wasn't really <em>that</em> original, as many of his teachings were already, in some way, present in the Torah, as well as in the broader Jewish culture of his time. They think the early Christian authors exaggerated what he did, said, etc. In other words, Jesus' cool went viral and experienced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a>. There are also many parts of his story that seem to have been picked up from other faiths active in the first century; a bit of Mithras here, a bit of Osiris there, a sprinkling of Apollo...
</li><li> Actually, according to <a class="urllink" href="http://skepticproject.com/articles/zeitgeist/part-one/">Skeptic Project's rebuttal of<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em><a class="urllink" href="http://skepticproject.com/articles/zeitgeist/part-one/">Zeitgeist<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, Jesus had little to deal with gods of other faiths.
</li></ul></li><li> Other first-century Jewish people, while purportedly writing secular history (or philosophy) also had reasonably concillatory things to say about Jesus, even if they didn't really think that much of the people around him.
<ul><li> Although the text has been subject to numerous Christian interpolations, Flavius Josephus's entry on Jesus is widely acknowledged to have a genuine kernel comprising the following:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <em>Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man. For he was a doer of startling deeds, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. And he gained a following both among many Jews and many of Greek origin. And when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him. And the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct at this day.</em>
<ul><li> Although not exactly effusive in praise, there isn't anything particularly hostile about his evaluation of Jesus and notes that his followers didn't scatter the moment he was crucified.
</li></ul></div><ul><li> Mara bar Serapion, a Stoic philosopher writing after one of the numerous Roman sieges and takeover of Sarmosota (giving a range of 73-200AD), had this to say to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyJunior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyJunior">his son, Serapion</a>.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <em>What are we to say, when the wise are dragged by force by the hands of tyrants, and their wisdom is deprived of its freedom by slander, and they are plundered for their superior intelligence, without the opportunity of making a defence? They are not wholly to be pitied. For what benefit did the Athenians obtain by putting Socrates to death, seeing that they received as retribution for it famine and pestilence? Or the people of Samos by the burning of Pythagoras, seeing that in one hour the. whole of their country was covered with sand? <strong>Or the Jews by the murder of their Wise King, seeing that from that very time their kingdom was driven away from them?</strong> For with justice did God grant a recompense to the wisdom of all three of them. For the Athenians died by famine; and the people of Samos were covered by the sea without remedy; <strong>and the Jews, brought to desolation and expelled from their kingdom, are driven away into Every land</strong>. Nay, Socrates did "not" die, because of Plato; nor yet Pythagoras, because of the statue of Hera; <strong>nor yet the Wise King, because of the new laws which he enacted.</strong></em>
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.textexcavation.com/marabarserapiontestimonium.html">If Jesus is identified with the "Wise King"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (and there are <em>very few</em> other candidates that would qualify for this role in the polemic [<a class="urllink" href="http://www.tektonics.org/jesusexist/serapion.php">link<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>]), Mara evidently thought him to be a wise lawgiver unjustly executed by his own people, an act which brought disaster upon the Jews.
</li></ul></div></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Gnosticism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Gnosticism">Gnosticism</a> Jesus is usually depicted as an emissary of the Good God, whatever their interpretation of Jehova. However, most Gnostics did not believe in salvation in the modern sense. They also usually did not believe Jesus was ever human, only <em>appearing</em> to be.
</li><li> Averted with the Mandaeans, who believe that Jesus was a false prophet, and that John the Baptist was the true messiah. However, they also believe Moses and Abraham were false prophets while Muhammad was the worst.
<ul><li> Played Straight with other Mandaeans, who think that he was, in fact, pretty cool... but get very annoyed at suggestions that he is superior to John the Baptist.
</li></ul></li><li> Many Buddhists, including at least one Dalai Lama, view Jesus as a Bodhisattva-an enlightened being who abstains from nirvana to help other humans attain it, and sometimes study portions of the Christian New Testament.
</li><li> Many Hindus, who tend to be <a class="urllink" href="http://www.city-data.com/forum/attachments/religion-philosophy/52163-krishna-jesus-many-similarities-krishna-christ.jpg/">extremely accepting<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of other religions (except, on the more extreme end, Islam, though the reasons for that are more to do with India's history with Islamic rulers and modern geopolitics than religion itself), believe that Jesus was an avatar of Vishnu, and that in healing people and allowing himself to be crucified, he was accepting the karmic load of the people around him. That last bit is in line with the Christian belief, just replacing "the people around him" with "every last human being ever born, ever" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">heroic sacrifices</a> are a universal trope).
</li><li> Porphyry, a Neoplatonist philosopher of the third century and the author of the mostly lost (as Christian Emperor Theodosius II ordered all copies burned) fifteen book-long treatise <em>Adversus Christianos</em> (Against The Christians), famously stated that:
<div class="indent"> <em>The Gods have proclaimed Christ to have been most pious, but the Christians are a confused and vicious sect.</em>
</div></li><li> Manichaeism declared that not only was Jesus divine, but that he had manifested on Earth several times more than recorded in the Bible, first coming in Adam and Eve's time.
