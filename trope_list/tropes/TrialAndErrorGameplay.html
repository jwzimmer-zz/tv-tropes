And, in the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> manner possible, this happens even if it was not possible to know in advance that it was a bad move at all. In the end, the only thing the player can do about it is reload the area and/or savepoint, play through that section again, and remember not to take that action next time. In essence, Trial-and-Error Gameplay is whenever it is almost <em>guaranteed</em> for the player to fail several times before realizing what is necessary to succeed.
</p><p>This is not limited to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> games.

It can feel much worse in games that have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameSetPiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameSetPiece">set pieces</a>, voice acting, or (heaven forbid) unskippable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene">cutscenes</a> that do/say/show the exact same thing every time like a skipping record playing a song you can't get out of your head.

</p><p>Amusingly, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EdutainmentGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EdutainmentGame">Edutainment Games</a> or Puzzle games, trial and error may actually be the puzzle itself. These count, but barely, because you may not be punished for getting it wrong; since the entire <em>point</em> is Trial and Error until you get the solution right. There are also in fact entire games dedicated around this concept too, although to be fair, these games generally tend to give you clues after you make an incorrect guess. Generally speaking, games based around this will generally have the "Trials" be the player learning how the game pieces work and interact with one another - and as a result, it does not take a lot of time to try again if you fail. Often these test skills such as recognising patterns and testing a hypothesis. This goes to show that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">Tropes Are Tools</a> - it <em>can</em> be made fair, it's just generally difficult.

<ul><li> The <em>Half Quake</em> series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1">Half Life 1</a></em> mods is full of this, along with at least one instance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a>. This is quite bluntly lampshaded in the first of them with the Hazard Course being replaced with an object lesson in sadism, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> by the game being intended to punish the player character, torturing and eventually killing them.
</li><li> This is a complaint sometimes leveled at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedGame">Stealth Based Games</a>, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCell">Splinter Cell</a></em>. Getting through an area undetected may require several specific actions performed consecutively, which can often only be discovered through trial-and-error.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MissionImpossible1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MissionImpossible1997">Mission Impossible (1997)</a></em> video game (which predates MGS by a few months) was particularly bad about this, due to a combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckpointStarvation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckpointStarvation">Checkpoint Starvation</a>, extreme linearity, and some rather vague mission objectives. For example, in one mission, one of your objectives is to eliminate an assassin at a tea party. The only problem? You're neither told who she is (other than her name) nor what she looks like. So the solution is arrived at purely by dumb luck.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Defcon5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Defcon5">Defcon 5</a></em> invokes this trope due to massive use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>; you're plopped down in the game's setting (a Mars colony ready to be opened) with no idea of what you're supposed to do, a map that only lets you cover your immediate area, and the requirement of picking up data pads scattered around the compound for items and info on your next mission (which are so vague you practically need a strategy guide to make heads or tails of).
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider">Tomb Raider</a></em> series dips in and out of this trope a lot, even between levels; some levels have many dangerous traps but are fair as long as you don't blindly run into everything (or show some haste when you do) and pay a modicum of attention to the surroundings, while others spring fatal (or at least very damaging) traps that are near-unavoidable with very little warning. TR 3 is probably the peak of this, with some levels having a seemingly sadistic desire to throw death-traps at you around every corner (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveGameLimits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveGameLimits">limited save system</a> if you are on the PlayStation version also doesn't help).
</li><li> At the Legendary difficulty level of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2">Halo 2</a></em>, the Jackal snipers kill you in a single shot and are surprisingly accurate. They can even shoot before directly aiming and bounce their beams off walls. Thus you are usually not aware of them until you have been killed. The best strategy for dealing with them involves memorizing the places they appear in the level.
<ul><li> Similarly, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats">Goddamned Drones</a> attack in swarms and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping">cherry-tap you to death</a> with plasma fire, and you often don't see them coming until it's too late to avoid death.
</li><li> The series' randomized jack-in-the-box <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RespawningEnemies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RespawningEnemies">Respawning Enemies</a>, which also make Legendary a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a> at times, ie you may get either a group of flunkies and a regular Elite, or two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Ultra Elites</a> spawning at a given point.
</li><li> H2's Legendary in general is a big load of trial and error, fake difficulty and luck-based situations. Not fun. Ironically enough, co-op is even more frustrating on Legendary, since both players start over when one of them dies. <br/>There are lots and lots of scenarios where, in order to survive, you have to know what's coming, be ready for it, and go through all the right motions exactly. (i.e., "Okay, I'll go here, shoot that Sentinal tube, go here, shoot that one, go here, kill that flood wave...") Which you obviously won't unless you've done the section before, and probably gotten killed many times. Many parts are almost choreographed, with there pretty much being one right sequence of when to take cover where, who to shoot when, when to go where, and so one, which you'll pretty much only discover by just doing the section repeatedly, trying tactics and maneuvers, and seeing what works and what doesn't over many attempts.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mercenaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mercenaries">Mercenaries</a> 2: World in Flames</em> has this annoying type of gameplay in several of the missions. As a particularly frustrating example... Your vehicle: a lightly armoured SUV. Your objective: drive around eight tanks, several static recoiless rifle positions, and multiple rocket grenadiers on your way to the corporate headquarters. Good luck!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RememberMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RememberMe">Remember Me</a></em> has the stand-out memory remix sequences, where you have to alter events in a person's memory in order to reach a different outcome than what actually happened in real life. These are largely driven by trial and error, and making some decisions creates memory states that are totally not what the player is trying to achieve.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon">First Encounter Assault Recon</a></em> Interval 2 you jump out of a window, land in an alley and find Alma there. Only this time, she's pissed and is engulfing everything around her in flames. She walks towards you. You shoot. She's invincible as usual. 'Running past' equals death. Behind you is a part of a building, basically a dead end. What do you do? Die a lot figuring out everything previously said. Then, as you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">back up towards the dead end trying to fight the inevitable and figure out how to live, she suddenly force-throws you through a window high above the dead end</span>. On to the next lev-...Wait, that's all you do? Damn.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman">Hitman</a></em> games it is quite possible to complete most missions on your first try, but it is virtually impossible to get Silent Assassin ratings without playing them through a few times or using a guide.
</li><li> An example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stalker">Stalker</a>: Call of Pripyat</em>: During an early mission, you're tasked with recovering a strange artifact from an old barge. As soon as you pick it up and exit, another stalker approaches you with an obviously fake sob story about his brother being sick and needing the artifact or something. If you refuse, he pretends to let you go, only to call a couple of buddies and shoot you in the back a moment later. Since you're caught by surprise and with no cover, dying is nearly unavoidable. The obvious solution, of course, is to reload your save and shoot him first.
<ul><li> The Stalker games can embody this trope in general, especially if you're playing on the higher difficulty levels or using a "realistic weapons" mod. Expect to die a lot without even knowing where the shot came from.

You can run missions on their territories to find out what mods can defeat your lich, but the correct order you will have to find by trial and error.

The game expects you to whip or otherwise attack suspicious parts of the environment, even though whipping the wrong parts will get you hit with a lightning bolt, and often times the only way to tell what's the right thing to strike is to just start striking. Not to mention, the ruins are filled to the brim with traps that will happily crush/drop/smack/or otherwise punish you for standing in the wrong place.

And there are many more outrageous puzzles of this nature to be found in the game.
<ul><li> This is made even worse by Graham having the option to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> eat the pie when he's about to starve</span> instead of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> eating (part) of a leg of lamb (which you may not have)</span> so you <em>can't</em> defeat the yeti.

After all, they reasoned, if you're going to die a lot, you might as well get a laugh out of it.
</li><li> A seasoned player of Sierra adventure games will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">be ready to save at every opportunity</a> while playing the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GabrielKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GabrielKnight">Gabriel Knight</a></em> game, until realizing that your character won't die no matter how haplessly he stumbles into secret voodoo conspiracies. That is, up until about the fifth day, after they've successfully thrown you off.

It's somewhat mitigated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsASlapOnTheWrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsASlapOnTheWrist">restarting the game one screen back.</a>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSeed">Dark Seed</a></em> games, although those are more susceptible to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a> issues than is normal for this trope.

<ul><li> The game in general, however, is known to be extremely cruel about being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign">Unwinnable by Design</a>. If you don't cheat, then you will probably need to restart multiple times to figure out: How to get to the meeting with Marvin in 12 moves; exactly which 10 items you need and where to get them; that you even NEED to give the sandwich to the dog; what you need to acquire in order to solve the Babel fish puzzle; etc.

You're given directions by the Shaman beforehand that the correct route is "left right right left", which you have to know or discover is "down up up down", remembering which direction you've been going between saving and reloading. Complete this section, and you end up talking to Hans Stroheim, an elderly man in a hut. You can't save while in the hut. If you don't know you're supposed to open the "offer" menu and give the map and compass, you die, since every normal dialogue option ends in death, forcing you to reload.

However, it justifies the save/restore function as an ability, and writes the trial-and-error aspect into another character that also had that ability.

</li><li> One of Ron Gilbert's complaints in the rant linked above, time limits, is played straight in RAMA. Although your explorations of the titular ship have hitherto been fairly leisurely and forgiving in constraints of time, and death has been a minor setback-a return to a point shortly prior to your death after a few remarks from Arthur C. Clarke that basically boil down to "We put this here, it's pretty apparently dangerous, you screwed with it anyway, try to be more careful in the future". Even after you've crossed the frozen sea and entered the city, things have been undemanding at worst. Through all this your play has been trial-and-error gameplay, but it's justified because you're a scientist studying this ship and you know about as much about it as any other character. Then, the sudden but inevitable betrayal happens and you have six real-time hours to solve the problem if you're standing still. When you move, the game deducts a couple of minutes from this timer to simulate the time it takes for movement. The same applies for performing an action. So you have significantly less than six hours to get off the ship, to do it you have to go to a completely new area of the ship, and you're so severely limited for time that the only way to get out in anything like a reasonable number of tries is with guide in hand.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheImmortal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheImmortal">The Immortal</a></em> is practically a Gygaxian dungeon in 3D video game form.
</li><li> While the FMV-heavy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonsLair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonsLair">Dragon's Lair</a></em> did not make use of this trope (if you died, it was because you missed the visible signal), at least one computer version does. There were numerous sequences where Dirk had to react to dangers at the right time, and these were <em>not</em> telegraphed. Memorization was necessary in the end.
<ul><li> Even more oddly, the <em>cartoon</em> invoked this trope. During a commercial break, the viewer was asked to choose Dirk's next move. When the show came back, it was revealed whether or not each choice resulted in his death. (Admittedly, this is a clever way of invoking the beautiful death animations from the game.)
</li></ul></li><li> This is used interestingly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfDestiny">Shadow of Destiny</a></em>; the main character always dies at the start of each chapter, and the rest of the chapter consists of trying to avoid that death after going back in time.
</li><li> Some MUDs, a form of text-based proto-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassivelyMultiplayerOnlineRolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassivelyMultiplayerOnlineRolePlayingGame">Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game</a> popular in the '80s and '90s, had "deathtraps" — rooms which killed your character instantly upon entering them and deleted all your equipment. The only reasonable way to avoid this was to use a spell or ability that lets you see what's in neighboring rooms and check every single one before entering. Understandably, some MUDs removed deathtraps to avoid driving players insane.
</li><li> <em>Ragnarok</em> (also called <em>Valhalla</em>) is a surprisingly expansive roguelike game, with an insanely high number of ways to die or screw up royally. While there are a minimum of in-game warnings (don't eat speckled mushrooms, the gods can't be killed, etc.), most of the time, it will be down to player experience to determine things like turning into a plant is near-instant death, to survive Niflheim, you need to be cold resistant, sentinel gaze attacks are incredibly dangerous, petrification resistance is a <em>very good idea</em>, randomly mixing potions at low levels (and low HP) is risky...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Panic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Panic">Panic</a>!</em> could be considered the epitome of trial-and-error. You play the <strong>entire</strong> game by pressing buttons to see what happens. Most of the buttons either make a silly gag happen, blow up a real-world monument, or teleport you to another scene. However, there are exactly three Game Over scenes, and a few more than three buttons can take you to them.
</li><li> Many older <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InteractiveFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InteractiveFiction">Interactive Fiction</a> games rely on this, where it's generally referred to as 'learning through death'. It's frowned upon in modern IF games, though less so when the plot of the game is built around it, like in Adam Cadre's <em>Lock and Key</em>.
</li><li> Fairly well-averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AVampyreStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AVampyreStory">A Vampyre Story</a></em>. The game almost always gives you enough information to solve puzzles without a guide, although sometimes you need to be sharp to catch it. As a non-spoilerriffic example, you need to lube up some hinges early on in the game, and in your bedroom you pick up some body oil that'll do the trick-but there's only enough oil for one hinge. No fear- the game will, if you "look" at the body oil, tell you it was made from oils extracted from nuts and dried fruits, which coincidentally you can also collect from your room. In some of the later puzzles it gives you all the pieces (a cop who desperately wants to be recognized as a hero, a little girl's dress, and a bat about the right size to fit into it) and leaves you to figure it out for yourself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThayersQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThayersQuest">Shadoan</a></em> is a mixed bag on this. Actual puzzles are usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonLogicPuzzle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonLogicPuzzle">Moon Logic Puzzles</a>. The problem comes with not running into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropInNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropInNemesis">Drop-In Nemesis</a> who can insta-kill you, not going to certain areas where you'll be insta-killed, skipping certain fights <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManyDeathsOfYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManyDeathsOfYou">where you'll be insta-killed</a>... Sometimes you even need to abuse the fast-travel system to get past screens without actually entering them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheresiaDearEmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheresiaDearEmile">Theresia: Dear Emile</a></em>, frankly, is <em>mean</em> about this. Open the lower door of the cupboard? You got a necessary item! Open the upper door of the cupboard? It shoots an arrow at your head! What, you wanted a clue which door to open? (To be fair, in the first half of the game the wrong choice is often smeared with blood, but the second half requires <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a> and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingPotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingPotion">Healing Potions</a>.)
</li><li> <em>Surviving High School</em> is also big on this. Most choices reveal a character's personality...AFTER you make them. Especially on dating. Luckily, it's friendly with them. Oh, and the actual system for leveling attributes is pretty mean.
</li><li> One puzzle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSpaceBar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSpaceBar">The Space Bar</a></em> revolves around predicting the assignments of <strike>guard dogs</strike> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallARabbitASmeerp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallARabbitASmeerp">queeps</a>. The game kind of implies that it's possible to figure it out through logic, but it's a thousand times easier and more reliable to just reload.
</li><li> On <em>Aztec Challenge</em> on the Commodore 64, one of the levels is a room with booby-trapped floor titles. You have to step on the right ones in the right order, or else you get shot through with arrows. As one would imagine, this level usually takes several attempts before the player is successful.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostTrick">Ghost Trick</a></em> the main character has the power to rewind time to four minutes before a person's death, and is encouraged to use this power extensively since in some cases it takes a lot of tries to figure out which objects to manipulate and in which order.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland">Monkey Island</a></em>:
<ul><li> During the first part of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretOfMonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretOfMonkeyIsland">The Secret of Monkey Island</a>,</em> part of the player's training in swordplay involves learning snide insults to throw opponents off-guard; without these insults and witty comebacks, the player can't win a swordfight. These quips are learned by hearing other pirates use them in fights; thus, the player is required to repeatedly enter fights with other pirates and lose, trying out new insults and weak come-backs until finally gaining enough to win a fight. The frustration of this is lessened, however, by the fact that the player can't actually die.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0axwo');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0axwo" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0axwo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The retorts are actually more important than the insults, as you're limited to retorts against the Sword Master, who always opens (and you need to figure out which retorts you can use against her unique insults; the connections are more obscure), but you need the insults to eventually have pirates retort them.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeFromMonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeFromMonkeyIsland">Escape from Monkey Island</a></em> replaces the insult swordfighting with Monkey Kombat, which is basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockPaperScissors">RockPaperScissors</a>. Each contestant chooses one of five poses; each pose ties against itself, beats two others, and loses to two others. However, the relationships change for each playthrough, as well as the command sequences needed to move from one specific pose to another specific pose! The player needs to spend time sparring with the monkeys to learn the sequences and relationships. (The only other constant is that any single command three times in a row maintains your current pose.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IsleOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IsleOfTheDead">Isle Of The Dead</a></em> falls into this category through the use of deathtraps you have no way of predicting. For instance, if you decide to pick up the rifle as soon as you see it, you'll set off a barely-visible tripwire and get <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiUUhEjyK1o">blown up by a random grenade<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, unless you notice the wire and cut it first. Should you then pull out the rifle and fire it, it'll <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wVVwHd6lmg">explode and blow your head off<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> unless you randomly decide to oil it first. And that's just the earliest example in the game.
</li><li> Invoked in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TakeshisChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TakeshisChallenge">Takeshi's Challenge</a>. The correct sequence of actions in order to complete the game is utterly counterintuitive. A few of the actions (like repeatedly singing the same song at karaoke) don't even qualify as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonLogicPuzzle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonLogicPuzzle">Moon Logic Puzzle</a>; the game doesn't even try to pretend the solutions make sense.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnnyMnemonic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnnyMnemonic">Johnny Mnemonic</a></em> game for the PC, you have to offload the massive data cache in your head before it kills you, much like in the film. Unfortunately, as this takes place in a cyberpunk future, practically everything is a computer (or is hooked up to one) whether it looks like one or not—and if you try to use one before you're supposed to, the game assumes you're trying to rip the data out of your head and will flash-fry Johnny's brain anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cyberia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cyberia">Cyberia</a></em> is outrageous about this during the adventure game segments. Open a door, shot in the face. Don't lock the door behind you, shot in the back of the head. Don't walk towards the cover to peek around it, shot from the side. Push a seemingly random button on a wall, trapdoor opens up. At least it's good with checkpoints.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TellTaleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TellTaleGames">Tell Tale Games</a> games are notorious for this.
<ul><li> A notable example is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWolfAmongUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWolfAmongUs">The Wolf Among Us</a></em>, where the Woodsman has just gotten an emotional weight off his chest by revealing to Wolf that when he saved Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother, it was by mere chance; he was actually planning to rob them, and only saved them in hopes of getting a reward. After he finishes, one of the response options is to "Glass Him." Given the context of the previous scene, combined with the fact that they are in a bar, many players assumed that this meant Wolf buying the Woodsman a drink. Instead, it has Wolf abruptly crack a shot glass against the Woodsman's head, prompting many-a-shocked game player to reload the section.
</li></ul></li><li> At the end of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NancyDrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NancyDrew">Nancy Drew</a>: Stay Tuned For Danger</em> adventure game, Nancy has to open a door (to save herself from the culprit) by pushing several buttons on a panel in a certain order. With <em>no clues given</em>. <em>Pure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialAndErrorGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialAndErrorGameplay">Trial-and-Error Gameplay</a></em>.

Still irritating, but not as impossible.</span>
<ul><li> Many of the subsequent Nancy Drew games also utilize the "find the arbitrary secret arrangement" puzzles in the form of, for instance, making the water level in a series of eight pipes the same by turning valves that each randomly change levels in one or more pipes. Madness!
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI">The Legend of Zelda I</a></em>: Due to graphical limitations, there's no clue as to which walls are bomb-able, which trees are burnable, and which screens have a "magic effect" when you blow the Recorder. Young Link is truly the most destructive fellow in Hyrule: in order to complete both quests (and particularly the second) you'll have attempted to destroy everything in the land. The original game came with a poster-size map of the overworld, so you could mark off your reign of terror as you went, and make notes of where the quest 2 dungeons are found (the overworld has the same layout, but the dungeons are remixed).

In one case the player dies in <em>a completely ordinary dead end.</em> Naturally, the latter version of the game has the riffers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshade</a> the ridiculous (and inconsistent) amount of danger the player character is in.

Every time someone wins a round, they add a new rule, but they don't tell anyone, requiring the other players to work it out by watching them enforce it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YuGiOhReshefOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YuGiOhReshefOfDestruction">Yu-Gi-Oh! Reshef of Destruction</a></em>, dueling some opponents can come down to learning their deck and inserting counters specifically for them.

<ul><li> In the very first race of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MidnightClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MidnightClub">Midnight Club</a></em>, there is absolutely no way to tell that you need to use a certain rock as a ramp to reach the finish point. The only way to possibly discover this is to watch one of the computer racers do it, which by definition means placing 2nd or worst. Of course, you need to place 1st in order to proceed in the game, so you <em>must</em> fail the mission at least once just to see how it's done.
<ul><li> <em>Midnight Club 2</em> is even worse, stretching this trope throughout the entire game in very annoying ways. Possibly the best example is in the third race of the game where the player spends the majority of it racing along the long, wide open highway, traveling at top speed. Near the end of the race the player must navigate an off-ramp while still going full-throttle, and of course a semi truck will pull right in front of you and block your path when you get close. The only way to get through unscathed is to drive precisely between the gap in the truck's wheels. The game gives the player almost no indication of which path to take, with an overhead arrow pointing directly at the next checkpoint, regardless of the actual layout of the streets. Blindly following the arrow will inevitably cause a player to crash into buildings or concrete dividers.
</li></ul></li><li> In the dragster wheelie competition in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeed">Need for Speed</a> Pro Street</em> some of the cars cannot pull a wheelie no matter how many upgrades you buy. Some of the cars are much easier to use for drifting too, and the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">doesn't give many clues</a> about what to buy. It's not a massive problem since the wheelie competition only comes along when the player will probably have enough credits to buy the 'right' car. But it's irritating to spend ages tinkering with car set-up and driving style in a vain attempt to get the nose of a Supra or RX-7 to lift when the game should mention somewhere that it's a waste of time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WanganMidnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WanganMidnight">Wangan Midnight</a></em> Maximum Tune 3's Ghost Battle mode. When you select a ghost to battle, you are only told the starting ramp, and not what route the ghost take, which gets annoying if, say, you select a ghost that starts on one of the faster routes (i.e. Wangan or Yokohane), and thus put all your tuning points into power and leave nothing for handling, but the race ends on the curvier C1 loop and you keep crashing into walls because your car has no handling whatsoever. The only way to know the route for sure is to have already battled the ghost or watch someone else race it.
<ul><li> Racing against normal ghost cars is tough enough (though more skillful players can take advantage of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberbandAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberbandAI">Rubberband AI</a>). Battling against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">King Ghosts</a> takes it to a whole new level, requiring both skill and luck, since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberbandAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberbandAI">Rubberband AI</a> is pretty much turned off for the player (meaning even the slightest collision is a surefire way to lose). Moreso if the player who set that King Ghost run did a near perfect run, and if the player challenging the King Ghost has a high level (A or higher) which increases the density of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnBats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnBats">traffic</a> that gets in the way. Even some of the most skillful players may take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper">dozens of attempts</a> to beat them, and King Ghosts have been known to remain unbeaten for at least a week.
</li></ul></li><li> Both <em>Stunts</em> and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrackMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrackMania">TrackMania</a></em> have an unwritten rule that the first run of a track <em>must</em> be played not to win, but to know the layout. Though, unless you play tracks by maps from total newbies, a lot of transitions and parts become very common and familiar. If you play the game for long enough, you intuitively assume the layout, thus you can get Gold or even Author Medals on the very first run if you have the experience.

<ul><li> While the player would not be punished with death for running out of allotted guesses, a couple <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheClueFinders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheClueFinders">The ClueFinders</a></em> games used this trope and the entire <em>point</em> was to test hypothesis and try to find out the logically correct answers.
<ul><li> <em>Reading</em>: The final challenges were basically comparable to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lingo">Lingo</a></em> or <em>Mastermind</em>, in which you have to type in a word and are then told whether or not you got any correct letters in the right places, or correct letters in the wrong places. This can be a little frustrating, as one can eventually run out of guesses and have to start over. Especially painful if they <em>just</em> figured out the password but ran out of guesses because the player typoed or it was <em>another</em> word that has just one letter difference between another word.
</li><li> One of the games in <em>Search And Solve</em> had this. You had to get a certain number of "kinks" out of a vending machine robot's circuits, and in order to do that you had to pick a column and row (Represented by colours and shapes). In order to work the kinks out, you had to guess which colour and shape were which row and column, then get the right coloured shape to push the kink out, so fairly simple, right? Well, every time, it's randomized, and you only have a certain amount of guesses. (And you would be surprised how "hard" the puzzles you had to solve in nine or less turns were compared to just the ten-guess ones!) So not only was it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a>, but also pure Trial and Error...one could just be <em>incredibly</em> unlucky and have all the kinks clustered to one side of the field and your first couple guesses were <em>all</em> the shapes and colours that do <em>not</em> contain any Kinks so the minigame is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a>. It wouldn't be that uncommon to be doing it <em>much</em> more than Four times (like the other minigames) simply because of the trial and error.
</li><li> Oftentimes in <em>3rd Grade Adventures</em>, the gates challenge at the Monkey Kingdom can be this, especially on the challenge difficulty. The way the challenge works is that there are two numbers. To progress, you must click on a number that equals either the first two numbers added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided. Note that you have to guess whether or not the correct number is the result of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, so as a result it's not uncommon to find <em>all four</em> possible answers on the board, meaning that you have to guess which one the game wants. However, this is slightly mitigated - since if you know where the next letters might be (They're adjacent to each other) then you can simply toss sneezeberries without it even having to be the right answer.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrannysGarden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrannysGarden">Granny's Garden</a></em> opens with a grid of sixteen trees which resembles a copy protection screen, except the only purpose of it is to try every single one until you find the magical one. Later, you encounter items which will end up triggering a trap if picked up, and others that you'll need to progress, and there's no intuitive way to distinguish between the two.
</li><li> The river-rafting minigame in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheOregonTrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheOregonTrail">The Oregon Trail</a> II</em> is pretty much this, as you often can't see a rock coming until it's too late to dodge it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdellLake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdellLake">Odell Lake</a></em>, you don't always learn what's what right away. "Osprey? Is that some smaller fish? Oh, it's a bird and I'm <em>its</em> dinner!" And even if you do get it right, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">you never know beforehand if those insects and larvae or that chub will be your dinner or your conveyance to the fish and chip stand</a>.
</li><li> <em>Mind: Path to Thalamus</em> includes a puzzle about crossing a series of platform and staircases. Some of the platforms and stairs are illusions that you fall through, while you must find the invisible platforms and staircases you can stand on. Illusions might extend seamlessly from visible, solid platforms, and invisible platforms can turn 90 degrees with no visible marker.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight">The Price Is Right</a></em> has a few games where the player can make a guess, is shown what they got right, and can try again. The best example is Clock Game, which is about guessing the value of the prize, being told it's higher or lower, and repeating until getting it right on the dollar before the clock runs out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lingo">Lingo</a></em> involves guessing what the mystery word is from the provided letters. The teams are spotted the first letter and have to spell out what they think is the right word. After each guess, the letters in that guess are given different colors for letters that are <em>not</em> in the word, letters that <em>are</em> in the word and in the right place, or letters that are in the word but in the wrong place.
</li><li> Some of the games of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TakeshisCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TakeshisCastle">Takeshi's Castle</a></em> may have contestants detect a pattern.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/AloneInTheDark1992" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/AloneInTheDark1992">Alone in the Dark (1992)</a></em> has quite a few:
<ul><li> There are two "evil books" in the library's secret room (which is already a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> to find). The first, "Fragments of the Book of Abdul", hurts you, while the second, "De Vermis Mysteriis", instantly kills you if you <strong>so much as look at the front page</strong>. That is, unless you are standing on the pentagram symbol in the room, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>.
</li><li> If you accidentally bump into a ghost (touching the one by the fireplace is almost certain on the first try), they come to life as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">nightmare-fueling</a> swirling cloud of psychedelic death that chases you around the house until it kills you.
</li><li> Another unavoidable first-time death occurs in the hallway leading to the library, where the woodsman painting starts throwing axes at you. Further down the hallway, a painting of an Indian starts shooting arrows that home in on you, at which point death is inevitable. The player learns the hard way to put the Old Indian Cover on the woodsman painting and to shoot the Indian painting with the bow and arrows.
</li><li> Simply opening the front door of the house results in death. One of the books you can find contains something that could remotely be considered a clue to this, but it's obscure enough that it's doubtful a single player has ever been stopped from trying to open the door in good faith (rather than to see the death) on their first playthrough.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/AloneInTheDark2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/AloneInTheDark2008">Alone in the Dark (2008)</a></em> is also rife with moments like this, such as the part where you have to scale the side of an exploding building. Such instances are often due to shoddy game design.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FearEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FearEffect">Fear Effect</a></em>, a Playstation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror">Survival Horror</a> game, embodies this to a tee. Given the mechanics of the health system (and the really arbitrary way of healing yourself), anything you try, be it solving a puzzle or duking it out with enemies, will usually result in a "special" death scene (which ranges from being shot to death, immolated, asphyxiation, and other bizarre ways to die). Many, many, times. It stops being funny when this happens 10 times in a row.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=-B9umBOmuzY&amp;feature=related">See some of the many deaths here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Siren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Siren">Siren</a></em> (Known as Forbidden Siren in some regions). Your characters have extremely limited health, are rarely armed and are placed in near pitch dark surroundings with enemies who are much stronger, and crack shots with firearms. Oh - and they're immortal zombies. So if you do manage to beat one in combat, it'll revive after a few seconds and come looking for you. Add Godawful controls, a useless map that doesn't actually show the player's position and level objectives which are often stupidly obscure into the mix and hey presto! Welcome to gameplay that alternates between you dying again and again, often scant seconds after starting a level, and stumbling around in the dark for hours, trying to figure out the hypercryptic level objectives.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfCthulhuDarkCornersOfTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfCthulhuDarkCornersOfTheEarth">Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth</a></em> has a scene (pretty directly lifted from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShadowOverInnsmouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShadowOverInnsmouth">The Shadow Over Innsmouth</a></em>) where you have to escape from some Innsmouth goons. There is one, and only one, correct escape route, and it is not very obvious. Taking a wrong turn will usually get your (unarmed) character gunned down.
<ul><li> And don't forget the ending, where exactly the right route must be followed, without even an inch of strafing, and you still can die because the timer doesn't stop even during the final cutscene. This is due to a bug that has something to do with an oversight in porting the game resulting in the main character's movement speed being reduced giving you BARELY enough time to make the trip.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HouseOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HouseOfTheDead">House of the Dead</a></em> series loves doing this by throwing zombies in mid-attack at you, though this doesn't happen in <em>House of the Dead 4</em>. Then there's the times when civilians suddenly appear to be rescued or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostageSpiritLink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostageSpiritLink">accidentally take away your lives</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu">Call of Cthulhu</a>-based adventure game <em>Shadow of the Comet</em> has a bit where your character visits a labyrinth-like crypt. After you meet a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">giant slug-like</a> monster, you have to escape from the crypt as it chases you. Unless you had the good sense to draw a map, the beast will tear you to pieces dozens of times as you try to find the right route. Actually, just <em>reaching</em> said slug monster invokes this trope, as the crypt features multiple doors that either kill you or warp you to the beginning of the maze, neither of which are distinguishable from the correct ones. That's not even touching on the insta-kill traps scattered about.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WaxWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WaxWorks">Wax Works</a></em> and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Elvira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Elvira">Elvira</a></em> games are notorious for this kind of game play. The players are often given little clue as to how to solve some of the puzzles, with all sorts of deathtraps from nowhere, and too many ways to render the games unwinnable.
<ul><li> <em>Elvira II - The Jaws of Cerberus</em>. If you enter the wrong room without protection, you'll get killed by a vampire, or burn to death, or ... In addition, if you lose a vital item (accidentally or by spending it for a spell - or for the <em>wrong</em> spell), the game is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The author of <em>BOH</em> doesn't mind this, and answered it in the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bohthegame.com/faq.html#Q10">FAQ.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <em>Clock Tower 2</em> / 3. Open a cupboard? You die. Look at a painting. Die. Look at a statue? Die. It doesn't help that the deaths are very unimpressive. You can button bash to avoid death, but it's quicker to just continue.
</li><li> <em>SCP-087-B</em>, the game that came before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SCPContainmentBreach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SCPContainmentBreach">SCP  Containment Breach</a></em>, is rife with this. Since the maps are randomly generated there is one type of hallway, the "forked path," where one of the paths leads to instant death. There's no hint on which path is correct, and since the player has to go through 130 floors the player is always going to come across this room at some point and it will always set the player back to the beginning.
</li><li> Despite being a pretty short game, <em>Go Home</em> is full of this. Notably, you can be killed immediately after solving the very first puzzle, by getting run over by a speeding truck. In a game that sets up such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurrealHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurrealHorror">Surreal Horror</a> atmosphere from the outset, you tend to not think of mundane things like needing to look both ways before you cross the street.

<ul><li> Depending on how charitable, fair, or even consistent the writer is feeling, this can be the only possible way to win at a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChooseYourOwnAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChooseYourOwnAdventure">Choose Your Own Adventure</a></em> book. Fortunately, it's not hard to flip back to the previous page.
<ul><li> The nature of Choose Your Own Adventure books is such that frequently you have <em>no</em> clue what outcome any given action might have. In fairness, this is sometimes true in real life also. But it's <em>usually</em> not a matter of "You stopped to pick a flower in a peaceful-looking field, so a dragon suddenly appeared and ate you." It doesn't help that "you" in the book are frequently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooStupidToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooStupidToLive">Too Stupid To Live</a>, such as continuing down a chosen path even when it becomes obvious that it leads off a cliff, instead of, y'know, turning back to the crossroads rather than walking blithely over the edge. <strong>Also</strong> not helped by authors who seem to feel that obviously suicidal choices should be rewarded and prudence should be punished, so that the stranger offering you candy to get in his van is actually a billionaire philanthropist scientist superhero with the one item that can save you, and your mom is actually a shapeshifting alien who has decided to see what human pancreas tastes like.
</li><li> Parodied by the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gamebooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gamebooks">Gamebook</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://images.kingdomofloathing.com/cyoa/">booklets,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which has obviously wrong choices to humorous effect.

Some of their attacks are obvious. If you get a message saying the boss is looking at you and a circle of fire starts to gather underneath, probably time to move. But some of them no one would ever guess until it is too late, e.g. when the boss starts casting a certain spell jump into the damage field it previously placed so that when the spell goes off and puts everyone to sleep, the damage you take from the field will wake you up. Or hurt the boss' aids until they're nearly dead so that when she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">frenzies</a> you can kill one of them instantly, because that will dispel the frenzy for some reason. Even now that the Journal provides an in-game manual to all boss abilities, it is a normal part of higher end gameplay to look up the plentiful player-written strategy guides in advance, and making sure that everyone knows what to do when. In other games, this might be considered cheating. In Wow, this is what the playerbase <em>demands</em>, since a boss with only normal gameplay mechanics will be fairly easy to the high-level players; bosses need new tricks to be challenging.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnotherWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnotherWorld">Another World</a></em> combines trial-and-error level design with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou">Everything Trying to Kill You</a> and, to add insult to injury, makes your character a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a>. Fortunately, Eric Chahi, the game's designer, acknowledged making one of the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> games of his time, and provided unlimited continues, somewhat easing the players' frustration. Without Trial-and-Error Gameplay, the game would take roughly an hour to complete. Depending on who you ask, this can be seen as shameless padding to compensate for storage limitations (it was graphically advanced for its time), an outdated method of creating a cinematic gaming experience by forcing you to perfect action movie stunts, or just part of the game's inexplicable charm.
</li><li> Many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> 2D games are like this. Try running full speed ahead (the whole point of the series) only to run into an enemy as a result of having mere milliseconds to react to it once it appears. Better sections in the series will have a short wall or upward spikes to let you know when it's time to stop running.
<ul><li> The final boss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations">Sonic Generations</a></em> is much harder than it should be due to the game drowning out the instructions on how to attack. You just have to experiment until you figure out what works.

Some of them are due to the notorious glitches. Some of them are due to the uncooperative camera. Some of them are due to the design choices in the game.

You are supposed to use your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoverBoard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoverBoard">Hover Board</a> to reach and throw 6 live bombs into 6 wells. 2 of the wells are hidden. The player has no idea the board can be used to scale the un-climbable hills. You only have <em>2 minutes</em>. Even if you think quick and try everything, you <em>will</em> run out of time, because the mission can only be completed if you <em>don't</em> stop to think and if you know all the wells' locations.
</li><li> Every single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell">Platform Hell</a> game and Mario hack ever created. Miss that perfect jump between two walls of spikes while dodging numerous Bullet Bills and spin jumping off a conveniently timed enemy? Instant death to the character. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IWannaBeTheGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IWannaBeTheGuy">I Wanna Be the Guy</a></em>, <em>The Unfair Platformer</em>, <em>Syobon Action</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KaizoMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KaizoMarioWorld">Kaizo Mario</a></em> (and every game based off the latter) are common users of this trope. The official course-building game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioMaker">Super Mario Maker</a></em>, is no exception, and may have more trial-and-error courses than any Mario hack due to its high public visibility.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RickDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RickDangerous">Rick Dangerous</a></em> suffered from a combination of this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou">Everything Trying to Kill You</a>. Literally every area was filled with dozens of hidden spikes, which would pop out of walls and floors, and you wouldn't even know they were there until you'd been hit (and sent right back to the start of the last scene). The only way to play through the game was to patiently wander into all the hidden traps on any given screen, remember where they all are, and avoid them all the next twenty or thirty times you replay it. May be considered an early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell">Platform Hell</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia1">Prince Of Persia 1</a></em> for the SNES contains one instance of this. While normally, every trap, hazard and enemy is clearly marked, there is one instance in one of the later levels where you find two identical potions. One <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartContainer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartContainer">increases your life total</a>, and the other instantly kills you. Thankfully this is near a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavePoint">Save Point</a>. This scene is absent in every other port of the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysDreamLand2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysDreamLand2">Kirby's Dream Land 2</a></em> had a section in world 7, where there was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutoScrollingLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutoScrollingLevel">Auto-Scrolling Level</a> with dead ends and no way to go back. There were 3 ways to go, and it happens several times. Technically there's a hint: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">All of world 7 is symmetrical and you go through the autoscroll in the opposite direction much earlier</span>, but it's extremely easy to miss. Even if you suspect you missed something, it's <em>much</em> easier to just keep doing trial-and-error instead of going back to check.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WonderBoy1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WonderBoy1">Wonder Boy</a></em> had platforms floating on the screens alone. Jumping to the next one was a leap of faith based on a random guess that ended in death if you guessed wrong.
</li><li> Many of the green stars in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a></em>, because they're found floating above bottomless pits, and in places carefully put just where the camera can't see. Hence quite a few of them are just 'jump in the general direction and hope you land on the star'. Or in the case of Flipsville, hope you fall into a star you can't judge the location of.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountryReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountryReturns">Donkey Kong Country Returns</a></em> takes this to an extreme, especially in the mine cart and rocket barrel levels where a slightest mistake will cost you a life. It's even <em>worse</em> in the temple levels due to there being no checkpoints, so be prepared to be back at the start very often (and soon see the pig beckoning you to take the easy way out and use Super Guide).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battletoads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battletoads">Battletoads</a></em> is much, much easier once you've memorized every obstacle instead of needing to react to everything as it comes.
<ul><li> Up to avoid the the lower barrier, down to avoid the upper barrier, jump the low wall, up, up, down, down, jump, down, up, down, crash into the lower wall for the warp point!
</li></ul></li><li> These moments have popped up occasionally in the <em>Mega Man</em> series:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX5">Mega Man X5</a></em> had a motor-bike stage which is basically all trial and error. What makes this noteworthy, though, is that this stage and this stage alone requires the player to jump while the "Ready!" stage start animation is still playing. In all other stages, the player <strong>can't move</strong> while the animation is playing. The only way to realize that this stage is special is by dying once. The rest of the level is also an effort in trial and error, as you're often required to make decisions (upper path or lower path?) with no way of knowing what's ahead.
<ul><li> The same thing happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan2">Mega Man 2</a></em>. Specifically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">Quick Man's infamous laser section</a>. All moves from the top of the fall to the bottom must be meticulously planned, but you don't know what's on the lower screens until you get there and see them, by which time it's too late. Sure, you can use the time stopper (if you have it) to stop things from moving, but if you did that you wouldn't be able to use it later in the level (because guess what's Quick Man's weakness). Luckily, Quick Man himself is one of the weakest bosses, taking 4 bars of damage from Mega Man's piddly little pea shooter. He can reasonably be killed with no special weapons at all.
</li></ul></li><li> The whole of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX6">X6</a></em>. Specific portions of levels are simply completely impassable if your character can't double jump or air dash.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan2">2</a></em> had two bosses completely invulnerable to the Mega Buster and with only one weapon (each) that worked against them. If you used up too much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">weapon energy</a> for those weapons too early, the battles were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a> until you either grinded for more weapon energy on the next life, or lost all your lives and used a continue. There's also a series of screens that has you racing against laser beams. If you transition to the next screen at the wrong angle, you die.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan3">Mega Man 3</a></em> nails you with this one time. In the second trip through Shock Man's stage, just after you beat Doc Robot the first time, you must slide (meaning you can't call the Rush Jet for this) into a pretty long (about three screens) drop down a weaving shaft lined with spikes, meaning you have to control your fall to avoid instant destruction. Because you're falling, your reaction time is darn near zero unless you already know what's coming.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan9">Mega Man 9</a></em> also had its "you will die with no warning" moments. On passage in Plug Man's stage looks safe, until a block suddenly materializes in its entrance, sending anyone trying to jump into it to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpikesOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpikesOfDoom">Spikes of Doom</a> below. One set of spikes in Splash Woman's stage cannot be seen until you've take the jump, and if you're now aimed for them, the games <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpPhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpPhysics">Jump Physics</a> aren't enough to let you steer away in time.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationRerelease">Mega Man Legacy Collection</a></em> (a compilation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan">Mega Man</a> 1-6) has "challenges", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTrial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTrial">Time Trials</a> where you play through different parts of various stages from the games, with teleport orbs taking you from one part to the next. The problem is, you won't know beforehand which part of which stage you end up in when teleporting, and gameplay resumes immediately giving you no time to prepare. Most of these are fair, sending you to relatively safe areas, but one of them sends you <em>smack in the middle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan2">Quick Man</a>'s second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">laser pit</a>,</em> where you have absolutely <em>no</em> time to react before a laser comes at you, so you have to start holding left <em>before</em> teleporting in. Good thing these challenges give you unlimited lives, and you respawn on the current stage when you die, but it still costs time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManPoweredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManPoweredUp">Powered Up</a></em> has a number of Elec Man and Oil Man's challenges. They grind down to "go fast, run into something that kills you that comes out way too fast to react to, like a spike wall, then deal with it next time". Not very good, that.
</li></ul></li><li> If you've played the multiplatform game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLostVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLostVikings">The Lost Vikings</a></em>, you know this one so well. As awesome as the game is, if you mess up even ONCE, you are DOOMED to repeat the level, almost inevitably. Use the wrong viking? Level is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">unwinnable</a>. Go down the wrong pit? Level is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">unwinnable</a>. One of the vikings dies? Level is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">unwinnable</a>. At least you get an unlimited amount of retries.
<ul><li> The game heavily lampshades its difficulty by having the vikings periodically complain about seeing the level before and getting tired of dying constantly whenever you retry a level.
<div class="indent"><strong>Baleog</strong>: I'm so familiar with the beginning of this level, I could do my part blindfolded. <br/><strong>Erik</strong>: Yeah, it's too bad the player keeps trying to prove the same thing.
</div></li></ul></li><li> The final level of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Trine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Trine">Trine</a></em> has a bad case of this. You have to climb up a narrow tower ahead of rising instant death lava while an undead wizard busily conjures objects to block your path. You're forced to endlessly repeat the level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading">(and its loading screen)</a> as you memorize exactly where and when the wraith will suddenly spawn a load of spiked balls, crates, or planks to block your progress.
</li><li> <em>Voltorometer Recharged</em>, for no good reason, suddenly decides to throw <strong>hidden bottomless pits</strong> at you during the escape sequence that happens after the final boss.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EightEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EightEyes">8 Eyes</a></em>, the first seven stages were theoretically playable in any order, but since each boss was vulnerable to only one weapon, and there would be a change of weapon after each boss, the game was nigh unwinnable to players who didn't know that the proper order was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Spain, Egypt, Italy, India, Africa, Germany, Arabia</span>. The manual told players to figure this out for themselves.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisIslandDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisIslandDS">Yoshi's Island DS</a></em> is this trope in spades, partly because the secret and extra levels are difficult enough to class as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell">Platform Hell</a>. Two of the most notable (read worst) examples of this are the various rooms in Yoshi's Island Easter Eggs (such as the one where the lights last for about two seconds, in a room filled with bottomless pits and enemies or the egg powered platform which is almost impossible to time correctly the first time around), or the rather unfair part in Yikes Boiling Hot! where after knocking down a bunch of rocks to use as platforms, the next one is followed by an instant death stream of lava timed just enough after the initial event that most people would be standing right under it where it fell.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisIsland">Yoshi's Island</a></em> also has this in Endless World of Yoshis, with not only the free fall section littered with instant kill spikes that you have to figure out as you go (three times without a checkpoint) but also the one way barrier in the cave. The key you need to open the locked door is the other side. You're meant to find a boulder to hold the door open while you retrieve the key, but this is never even hinted at during the rest of the game nor ever required.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AstroMarineCorps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AstroMarineCorps">Astro Marine Corps</a></em> is the kind of game where many of the enemies can pop up and kill you instantly with little to no warning.
</li><li> The very likely to be removed in short notice <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em> hack <em>Super Mario -Lost Brain- Ultimate Edition</em> has this in spades. And by in spades, we mean in the cheapest way possible. See those normal objects? Every single one can randomly kill you without warning (as in, complete arbitrary cannons, blocks, water, coins or other stuff). They can also not kill you (in other levels). In other levels, the GROUND can kill you. In others? The AIR ITSELF. As in, random patches have what appear to be <strong>invisible spikes</strong> that insta-kill without warning. Oh how not so fun it is to play Russian Roulette with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell">Platform Hell</a> setup.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rayman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rayman">Rayman</a></em> is all about this, being an epically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> romp that throws everything at you from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalevolentArchitecture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalevolentArchitecture">Malevolent Architecture</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">Bullet Hell</a>, with you getting past one obstacle only to be bitch-slapped by the next. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaymanOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaymanOrigins">Rayman Origins</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaymanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaymanLegends">Legends</a></em> are similar, but the difficulty is severely toned down and most of the trial-and-error aspect is towards the option of finding enough Lums and finding each Electoon cage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaymanOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaymanOrigins">Rayman Origins</a></em> plays this painfully straight with the bosses. They have one pattern of attacks that they perform in the same order each and every time. Since they don't telegraph their moves and you have no clue what's happening next, each boss battle is basically a memory test. Defeating each boss boils down to dying repeatedly and getting a tiny bit farther each time until you finally make it to the end.
</li><li> The infamously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostsNGoblins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostsNGoblins">Ghouls 'N Ghosts</a> has an area a short ways into level 2 where you must jump onto rickety rope bridges to get over some sucking quicksand pits. What nobody tells you, of course, is that these rope bridges are programmed to break in a few specific, unmarked locations, usually over the center of the pit, so as to send you plummeting to your death with no recourse.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Limbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Limbo">Limbo</a></em> was described by its own creators as having "trial and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManyDeathsOfYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManyDeathsOfYou">death</a>" gameplay. You will die, a lot, and you're expected to until you figure out what to do with each new obstacle.
</li><li> Featured in a couple of castle levels in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros1">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>, including the final dungeon. You have to choose the correct routes through the dungeon to progress or you'll be forced back to the last checkpoint to choose another. Other than by memorizing the right and wrong ways there's no way of knowing the right paths without a guide. Castle 8 was even trickier because not only does the correct path involve locating and taking pipes, but some of the pipes go <em>backwards</em> back to the first chamber while some of the correct pipe choices are easy to overlook. At least the maze only goes as far as the underwater section.
<ul><li> One of the last levels in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em> has the same problem, and it's in fact even worse due to is labyrinth nature, resulting in many players running out of time trying the find the right path.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HansKloss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HansKloss">Hans Kloss</a></em>: You will keep dying or getting stuck a lot until you manage to map out the entire game and figure out the right route. Once you know where to go and which doors to use keys on, the entire game can be completed in 20 minutes.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkyRoads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkyRoads">Sky Roads</a></em> often contronts the player with a choice of paths, not making it clear which one isn't fatal until too late. The worst are the tunnels which completely conceal deadly burning red squares from the player's view.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Holdover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Holdover">Holdover</a></em> is a rather short game, but this trope is imposed on you to compensate for this, as you are constantly threatened by dangers such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpikesOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpikesOfDoom">Spikes of Doom</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams">Frickin' Laser Beams</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureStyle">and most significantly</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OxygenMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OxygenMeter">the high risk of drowning</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou">You are expected to perish from these dangers constantly</a>, only to then memorize the facility's layouts and figure out the safest ways of getting through these hazards.

Level 140, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">ICEDEATH</a>, relies on guessing which direction to take at every point on the ice of which typically only one of the three new directions leads to safe ground, while the other two lead to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills">watery grave</a>.

Along with already having an unusual gameplay gimmick (in battle, most characters can only use the "magic" and "item" commands while there), there are no save points in the tower and the Warp spell doesn't work. The boss at the top of the tower, upon death, automatically casts Ultima, a ludicrously powerful unblockable spell that will kill your entire party unless you're obscenely overleveled. There is absolutely no indication that this is coming, and the only way to survive is to have Reraise cast on at least one party member so they auto-resurrect after this attack. Also, because Warp doesn't work, you have to get all the way down the tower as well after beating the boss, so it's very important to make sure you've kept up your MP one way or another. Effectively, if you aren't using a guide you are practically guaranteed to die to the boss the first time you attempt this dungeon and have to start all over again from the beginning.

On one side you can only use physical attacks and the other, only magic.

Which means you also know what spell is coming. Being a single target, reflectable spell the game has shown you before, you have a lot more options on countering or surviving it, <em>including</em> breaking him as a boss. But who needs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">puzzle elements</a> or strategy when you can remake it pointlessly cheap and frustrating?

The second phase of the battle randomly casts Zombie on party members, and then heals them (which damages party members affected with Zombie). Because there is no way of restoring the hit points of any character with Zombie, the natural impulse of the player will thus naturally be to de-Zombify any character afflicted with the status. So what happens at the third phase of the battle? Naturally, she casts an instant death move that automatically kills any party member not afflicted with Zombie, even if they have Deathproof armour. There is absolutely no way of knowing that she will do this ahead of time. Oh, and there's an unskippable cutscene before the battle. This verges on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">Fake Difficulty</a> and the fight is almost universally despised even by people who otherwise praise the game.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em> has this for its battle system. You can set six different paradigms which will tell your AI what roles they are in and what moves to perform. However, the game can be difficult and certain enemies (bosses in particular) demand a particular strategy or a "Deck" (specific paradigm suits) in order to obtain the five star ranking to increase item drop rates. One of the only ways to know if your paradigms are no good for a particular segment or mission is to get into some fights, get your ass beat, start over, and configure the correct paradigms to suit the mission in general. Thankfully though, many of the enemy team formations in a given area are susceptible to a certain deck or formation (weak to magic? team of Ravagers/Relentless Assault will fix that), so it's not like you have to configure the paradigms that often until you tackle the missions or the endgame bosses, but rather find out the enemies and figure out the proper assault choices to conduct battle.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em> is notorious for this. Although it's somewhat part of the design of the game it has very heavy instances of this. Many times newcomers to the series can be found exclaiming they don't understand what to do or are dying repeatedly to a monster and don't know how to beat it. The game gives very little useful information to the player about how to actually play the game well. The enemies are designed for the player to make mistakes and they will frequently be fatal mistakes. Sometimes the game also throws monsters that act as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>. The monster is often there to force players into using new strategies since old ones are outright punished. Barroth was this hurdle in "Monster Hunter Tri". Monsters before it were slower and hit for lower damage and had many openings. Barroth was fast and struck hard changing the pace of the fight from the previous fights while having much more difficult-to-discern openings.
<ul><li> Sometimes the series uses this trope to the detriment of the game. As of 3rd generation (namely <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MH3U" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MH3U">MH 3 U</a>) monsters' AI has become noticeably more random in it's attack combinations leaving very few openings to get in reliable attacks causing frustration for players and turning some fights into a guessing game about when a good opportunity to attack is. Brachydios, for instance, can spam as few or as many as 1-4 fist slams at any moment after almost any attack while other attacks such as the "standing horn slam" causes random sets of fixed explosions in order from closest to furthest from him giving the player no good understanding of when to attack, but you have to attack at some point because you're on a time limit every quest. Therefore you must risk damage/death at a moments notice just to get simple damage in during certain parts of the fight. It isn't always a problem for all weapon classes on all monsters but for particular weapons it can come off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBalance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBalance">Fake Balance</a>, where some weapons are clearly inferior to others in a fight due to this trope occurring.

Attacking it directly doesn't hurt it and triggers a powerful counterattack. Attacking one of the smaller orbs does one of two things: Four of them will trigger counterattacks, and the fifth will cause damage to the boss. They all look exactly the same. To win the fight, you need to attack the smaller orbs until you find the right one, then focus on that one until the boss shuffles them around.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em> has some elements of this: there are many traps and powerful enemies, and players need to be cautious and observant in order to survive them all. As well, the player is <em>expected</em> to die to bosses on their first (several) attempts, as the game uses death itself as a learning mechanic: get killed by a boss's attack, learn its telegraph, dodge it the next time only to be killed by a different attack, rinse and repeat. Even a highly skilled player who is playing through the game a second time is likely be to killed if they're ever caught off-guard. Players can leave messages to one another to warn about upcoming dangers, but beware, for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Trolls</a> like leaving fake messages as well.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsI">Dark Souls</a></em>, the first in the series, was notable for a few very problematic areas, above even the normal progression of the game.
<ul><li> The Hellkite Dragon/Bridge Wyvern/Red Drake at the cusp of Undead Parish, after defeating the Taurus Demon. At the level that it is encountered at, it can kill the player in a mere one or two attacks, and blocks the way into the Parish. And unless you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunOrDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunOrDie">make a break for</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorridorCubbyholeRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorridorCubbyholeRun">the safe spot in the middle of the bridge</a> before it gets a chance to roast the length of the bridge, chances are you'll die and have to go through the entire Upper Undead Burg all over again just to unlock the shortcut back to the bonfire. And this isn't even getting into actually fighting the creature itself.
</li><li> The Capra Demon at the end of Lower Undead Burg is notorious for ending most first-timers' runs. You must pass through a fog gate to get to bosses, and the Capra Demon and two rabid dogs attack you without warning, even before the fog gate stops obscuring your vision. Many players get instantly killed a few times without even finding out what's attacking them, and take many more attempts before finding the precise order of actions to take in order to get enough space to kill those two dogs and stand a fighting chance against the Capra Demon itself.
</li><li> Blighttown. The descent down to the bottom is otherwise rather painless, were it not for the almost perfectly-camouflaged blowdart snipers with uncanny range and accuracy who inflict severe Toxic, enough to kill most players in mere seconds if they don't have Toxic curing consumables. In order to survive the level, players will have to equip a poison-blocking shield (that's a missable pick-up), immunize themselves with Dung Pies (which gives them the Toxic status effect but drains HP much more slowly), or try to find and counter-snipe them (which requires having enough Strength/Dexterity to use a bow). Thankfully, the snipers don't respawn, so killing them just once is enough.
</li><li> Sen's Fortress is one of the most notorious areas in the entire game. Not only is it filled to the brim with extremely lethal traps (from swinging blades to pressure-plate traps to rolling boulders), but is also guarded by snake-men that are extremely resistant to physical damage, only becoming easier to defeat once the player finds a specific elemental weapon that's dropped by a specific enemy partway through the dungeon. In the meantime, players will have to learn (the hard way) how to avoid all the traps and beat all the enemies, with each death sending the player back to the start, and the <strong>only</strong> bonfire in the entire level being accessible through a hidden drop-down.
</li><li> The infamous Bed of Chaos boss, the source of huge amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">Fake Difficulty</a> in a game normally absent of it. It's the only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">Puzzle Boss</a> in the entire game, so first you need to figure out how to damage it. Then, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits">Bottomless Pits</a> open up in the floor without warning, instantly killing you if you happen to be there. Fortunately, the boss does not reset when you die, so previously collapsed floor sections stay that way, and the boss retains its HP level.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII">Dark Souls II</a></em> also has its share of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> moments.
<ul><li> The Dark Stalkers in No-Man's Wharf can be a pain to deal with unless you know what their weakness is ahead of time. They're long-reaching, hard-hitting and their attacks will build up your bleed bar even if blocked. What isn't immediately apparent is that if you shine a light in their faces, they'll recoil and back away, allowing you to cut them down with minimal resistance.
</li><li> The Lost Sinner can be one of the harder early-game bosses to beat without proper preparations. When fighting her head-on, the poor lighting in the room will reduce the player's lock-on range, making it easy for her to simply jump over you, break target lock and bring her greatsword into your back while you're wondering where the hell she went. So you'll have to light the torches outside of the arena first, which proves impossible without the Bastille Key (which, in the original PS3/360/<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DX9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DX9">DX 9</a> version, requires beating an optional boss to get).
</li><li> Dragon Aerie can prove to be plain impossible to get through without learning the real trick to getting to the end. While the enemies are certainly not insurmountable, the entire level is littered with dragon eggs that seem to serve no purpose other than to be destructible objects; destroy any number of them, and the dragons will get <strong>pissed</strong> at you, to the point where if you try to leave to go to the next area, <em>they will swoop down on you and destroy the bridge you're standing on, dropping you immediately to your death</em>. Unless you know that these dragon eggs are the source of your problems, you're likely to just keep trying to run through the level and dying at the end because you didn't know to leave them alone.
</li><li> The (optional) Ancient Dragon boss is widely considered one of the most frustrating bosses to beat in the base game. The first time the player encounters this fight they will have no way of knowing that practically any attack suffered will cause instant death to the player. If the player tries to block with any shield other than the Gyrm's Greatshield, almost maxed out with max stamina, then all fire attacks will break the players guard and instantly kill them. Alternatively the boss's flying, fire breath attack tracks the player for the first 30% of the attack and has massive AOE (area of effect) damage that will instantly kill the player. As a result if the player is not under 25% weight encumbrance they simply are not fast enough to always dodge the breath attack.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">King Vendrick</span> can prove nearly insurmountable without the right items on hand. Unless the player knows to collect Giant Souls (only three of which make themselves readily available to the player, with the remaining two hidden behind optional enemies), he'll have an absurd amount of damage resistance, causing two-handed strong attacks with a maxed-out ultra greatsword to deal chip damage to him and rendering any attempt to defeat him futile (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss">unless you're extremely persistent</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodBorne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodBorne">Bloodborne</a></em> has moments of this like in previous Souls games. Of note is a couple of the chalice dungeon bosses.
<ul><li> The Bloodletting Beast often starts the fight launching a difficult to avoid punch that can easily one-hit kill the player. Its easy to see the charge up but almost impossible to know the exact timing of the punch until he is fought a few times meaning the likelihood of many deaths. Also many of his standard attacks can instantly kill low HP builds without forewarning.
</li><li> Pthumerian Descendant has many combos that can instantly kill lower HP builds that come out of seemingly nowhere and are fast to boot. Also he covers an insane distance which will often catch a first time fighters off guard leading to being combo'd to death.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII">Dark Souls III</a></em> learned a lot of lessons from its predecessors, but doesn't quite avoid this trope.
<ul><li> Cathedral of the Deep is perhaps one of the most well-designed levels in the game, however it is also one of the more frustrating areas to navigate due to checkpointing and difficulty. The rooftops are full of crossbow archers who launch multiple volleys at the player from range, the inside of the cathedral proper is guarded by two giant slaves whose attacks can easily shave off half a player's health bar in one hit, the lower floors are guarded by extremely tough Cathedral Knights and riddled with all sorts of poison traps, and there is only <strong>one</strong> bonfire in the entire cathedral, requiring the player to progressively unlock shortcuts back to the main chapel area.
</li><li> Irithyll Dungeon has earned a deserved reputation as pain incarnate. Beyond the layout of the dungeon itself, it's filled with Jailer enemies that will reduce quickly your health just by looking at you (read: not deal continuous damage to you, but <em>lower the maximum number so that you can't heal it back</em>. If you're not careful and run headfirst into a Jailer, expect him to stun-lock you with his branding iron, and then proceed to kill you in one hit thanks to having reduced your HP down to double digits after chasing you down, sending you back to start.
</li><li> Yhorm the Giant can be this due to the mechanic required to defeat him in a timely manner. As the biggest Lord of Cinder, and as a proper giant, he takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> from almost all of the Ashen One's attacks, unless they're targeted on his arms and head (staggering him will allow the player to perform a visceral-like attack that takes off a big chunk of his health). However, even with this, Yhorm is still a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss">Marathon Boss</a> who can end players in a few successful attacks, unless you take the time to search the boss room and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">find the Storm Ruler near his throne, and then equip it and shave off huge swathes of his HP bar at a time using the weapon art</span>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Feebas in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Pokémon Diamond and Pearl</a></em> can only found by fishing in a few specific squares in a large body of water. There's no way to find these special squares, other than fishing in hundreds of places for hours. Later games got rid of this ridiculous tediousness by making the Feebas-squares visible.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioStickerStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioStickerStar">Paper Mario: Sticker Star</a></em> received a ton of flak for this. Most puzzles require a specific Thing to beat, and using the wrong one deletes it from your inventory; this wouldn't be a problem, except that many of the puzzles are completely illogical and require items found in different levels (One notorious puzzle puts a tornado in Mario's way. To get past, you have to find a household vacuum cleaner in a secret room in <em>another world</em>, and then make the cognitive leap that a vacuum cleaner is capable of sucking up a tornado). Boss fights are oftentimes unwinnable if you don't use a specific Thing - again, not found in the same level - at a specific time. Enjoy having to backtrack to refind all of the Things you lost trying to solve a puzzle.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Faria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Faria">Faria</a></em>, you have to fall off the cloud level in just the right spot, or else you have to go back and do it over again.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChroniclesX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChroniclesX">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a></em> has several missions in which picking the wrong dialogue choice results in an innocent NPC's death. At least three of these missions require you to overhear information from somebody in the massive New Los Angeles or the many BLADE camps scattered across Mira in order to even be <em>able</em> to make a life-saving choice; one of them requires you to have obtained a certain rare collectible on top of that. Two other missions require you to be able to know the geography of a region and the attacks of a specific enemy type, respectively, from memory.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em> in precisely one instance: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sans' boss battle.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> games feature dialogue wheels with options that often don't sound like what Shepard says in result. It could be very possible to be doing a Paragon playthrough, only to pick an option that looks like a harsh chastising and suddenly reloading yourself after Shepard blasted the other end of the conversation.

At the mid-point and end of each level you are given the opportunity to sell and buy equipment, but without having already played the following section there's no way of knowing which one of the two you should have - and if you get it wrong, you <em>will</em> lose.
</li><li> The C64 shoot-em-up <em>Delta</em> is pretty much the embodiment of this trope. Enemy waves will quickly scroll across the screen, usually before the player can hope to kill them with their pea-shooter of a gun, and will inevitably destroy the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a> player ship. A post on a C64 forum described it as an "interactive memory test disguised as a game".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThunderForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThunderForce">Thunder Force</a> III</em> has a few death traps that, without prior knowledge, are nearly guaranteed to kill you. Examples include a pillar of lava on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">Gorgon</a> that doesn't stop, <em>very</em> sudden enemy attacks, and the moving terrain in Haides.
</li><li> At a glance, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ikaruga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ikaruga">Ikaruga</a></em> doesn't require a lot of this. But playing for score, which requires stringing together chains (shooting 3 consecutive same-colored enemies), is like studying for a final exam.

<ul><li> Mima back in <em>Story of Eastern Wonderland</em> has a pattern where she'll briefly charge... then ram the area below her. You're not fast enough to get out of the way after she's started moving.
</li><li> Yuuka was fond of this back in <em>Lotus Land Story</em>. As a stage five boss, she'd stop and charge up... then hit 90% of the screen with an undodgeable laser (at least undodgeable if you didn't know that it was coming). In stage six, one of her patterns put a circle under the player. Following action-game instinct and moving away would kill you, since it was actually the safe spot.
</li><li> <em>Subterranean Animism</em> is quite fond of this. Examples include Parsee's midboss spell card,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5xtic');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5xtic" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5xtic');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A homing bullet spawn point.

</li><li> The systems for gaining more lives and bombs in <em>Undefined Fantastic Object</em> and <em>Ten Desires</em>, while not <em>requiring</em> memorization, strongly encourage it.
</li><li> Anything with infinite lives will be shameless about their use of this trope. Including <em>Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom</em>, which has on option to play with lives instead of checkpoints.
</li></ul></li><li> A vast majority of the challenge in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RType" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RType">R-Type</a></em> series is knowing exactly where to be at all times, even when there's nothing dangerous on-screen. In fact, an empty screen is a good sign that SOMETHING is about to clamp down or fly open or sweep through and trap and crush you, unless you know beforehand which square inch of the screen is safe. That square inch also moves around a lot, and its interior walls usually spray bullets at you.
</li><li> Topping <em>Ikaruga</em>'s chaining is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaidenFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaidenFighters">Raiden Fighters</a></em>'s Micluses. To find out where they are, you'll either be doing this trope <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">A LOT</a></strong> or watching superplays.
</li><li> <em>Last Hope</em> by NG:DEV.TEAM is a good modern example. It's even more memorization-heavy than <em>R-Type</em>, to the point where even getting past the first level requires you to plan and memorize a path through the entire stage.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ImageFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ImageFight">Image Fight</a></em> and <em>Image Fight 2</em> are both extremely memorization heavy shmups by IREM.

<ul><li> Chapter 14 is particularly bad about this: The briefing says your mission is to capture the enemy camp, but <em>nothing</em> even remotely hints that, when you <em>do</em> capture it <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> two giant tanks appear from the top and bottom of the map, and your objective now is to destroy both of them</span>. If you left your <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Anti-Tank</span> units behind, you're screwed. There's also Chapter 13, where the only path to the enemy camp <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is blocked off by a minefield</span>. If you forgot to bring <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> an Engineer, who can disarm mines</span>, you're pretty much forced to restart. There's absolutely no way you can know about that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> minefield</span> until it's already too late.
</li></ul></li><li> A particularly bad example can be found in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert3">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3</a>: Uprising</em>. The final Allied mission has you going up against an Empire commander after choosing one of two locations to build your base on, no big deal. The northeast position looks far, far more defensible and has closer ore nodes, so most players will probably pick it on their first playthrough. However... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As soon as you kill off the Empire commander, the real Big Bad reveals himself and comes gunning for you. The map expands to accommodate his base and guess what - it's DIRECTLY north of the earlier mentioned starting position. Which before marked the edge of the map, so you probably have no defenses there whatsoever. And he starts out with a ridiculously huge and well-equipped strike force already rushing to attack you. Hell, there is a good chance his longer-ranged units will be shelling you before the cutscene even ends. If you didn't know this was coming you are basically GUARANTEED to die, and even when you're prepared it's a difficult battle.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em> has shades of this, since you're never given a clue as to what sort of situation you're getting into before a battle. You just have the (very basic) layout of your team's immediate starting area, so if you unwittingly put your team of melee combatants into a map against, say, a whole team of archers and mages on the other side of a valley or river, you're in trouble.
<ul><li> Especially bad during several sequential battle sequences, where you no longer have the option of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a> if you don't have the right job classes available or if you simply aren't high enough level for the enemies. This can lead to several instances where the game is essentially Unwinnable... Especially during the final game sequence if you made the mistake of passing up your special characters in favor of the generic ones and thus missed the dozens of fights which comprised the "optional" portion of Chapter 4.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SupremeCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SupremeCommander">Supreme Commander</a></em> and its standalone expansion, <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ForgedAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ForgedAlliance">Forged Alliance</a></em>, rely heavily on scripted events and changing objectives during the singleplayer campaign, often meaning you're screwed unless you took every possible precaution or knew what was coming. Huge enemy armies have a habit of popping up at the edge of the map when you least expect them, the map itself can expand in unexpected directions, you may suddenly receive objectives that are impossible to complete in your current state, and so on. The missions are actually fairly easy once you know what's about to happen, because you generally have unlimited time to prepare (despite the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinueYourMissionDammit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinueYourMissionDammit">nagging you to hurry up)</a>, but trying to pass a mission on the first try can be an exercise in frustration.
<ul><li> The 4th Cybran mission is a perfect example of this. In the beginning, you're tasked with destroying an enemy base on an island and capturing a building. As soon as you finish this objective, the map expands and you see another base, far off to the west, which is already under attack by the enemy and asking for your help. Unless you have a large army prepared and ready to go (in transports, no less, and not sea units, as they won't get there fast enough), the mission is lost. There is no way to prepare for this unless you knew about it in advance.
</li><li> Similarly, the final Cybran mission basically pits your faction (known for its weak defenses) against relentless attacks by two different enemies from different directions, alongside throwing mission objectives at you. Unless you know exactly what to build when, you basically stand no chance.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> games can be this to a player trying to not lose any units, thanks to enemy reinforcements. Often, units will spawn behind where the player's main force is likely to be at a certain point in the battle, and one has healers, mages, and archers in the back. In some games or situations, reinforcements will announce themselves without warning, appear on the map in a spot pre-programmed but unknown to the player, move, and attack, all in a single enemy phase. Or it will just be one of those damn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfWar">foggy levels</a>.

Many of them require beforehand knowledge of what will happen in the heavily scripted missions, as attaining them without this knowledge can be virtually impossible.

<ul><li> As displayed in the page quote, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGames">Tabletop Games</a> players have a term for a dungeon with particularly random ways to inflict instant death: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Gygaxian</a>, though the term also implies heavy use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalevolentArchitecture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalevolentArchitecture">Malevolent Architecture</a>. One of the most famous modules of this type is the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TombOfHorrors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TombOfHorrors">Tomb of Horrors</a></em>. People who survived that module largely did so by searching <em>everything</em> for traps, and sending <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> to open every door in the dungeon. (It should be noted that it takes more effort to roll up a new character than to load a saved game.)
<ul><li> Favourite Tomb of Horrors moment: There's at one point a statue of a demon that holds an orb. This orb is a teleporter you need to pass through. There's ANOTHER identical demon statue right next to it. That one isn't a portal though — it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">''Sphere of Annihilation''</a>. Oh, and to get through the teleporter safely, you need to perform a non-obvious sequence of actions.
</li></ul></li><li> The board game <em>Mastermind</em> is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">the entire point of this trope</a>. The object of the game is for one player to put down pegs in a pattern, and for the second player to guess what colours the pegs are and in which order they're placed. The first player then tells them whether they have any correct colours in the right places <em>or</em> correct colours in the wrong spaces, so the second player has to use those clues given by the first player to guess what order the pegs are in.
</li><li> Also the entire point of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/Battleship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/Battleship">Battleship</a></em>, where both players try to destroy the other players' fleet by guessing a random square on the grid, and then being told whether or not they hit a ship or missed it, and if you hit, you have to guess what adjacent squares contain a ship as well.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder17');">    Visual Novels </div><div class="folder" id="folder17" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> A general rule of thumb in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse">Type-Moon</a> games is to always pick the most dangerous option when you're given one. Playing it safe usually ends up with you being eaten by a shark on the ninth floor of a hotel.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a></em>: If you don't leave a room, you die. If you attack a temple, you die. If you refuse the call, you die. Luckily, you get NUMEROUS "Have a nice death" things from the Tiger Dojo or Ciel-Senpai.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em>: Shiro comes up with a plan to win one of the coming big fights and all you have to do for the decision is follow that plan...the problem is that you the player are not told what the plan is until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee">after this vital decision</a> and since you're PLAYING AS SHIRO, there's no reason you aren't told what the plan is.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Enzai</em> is quite merciless if you want to get another ending that's not suicide or being a sex-slave, partly because the only choices that would lead you to a satisfactory ending are counter-intuitive at best. You chose to open the folder that would possibly have information on how to escape prison before a box of chocolates? Enjoy your remaining 30 gameplay minutes before the game kills you. Wanted to go to Jose's cell for a notebook that allegedly would set you free from jail? Say hello to your new life as Durer's sex slave. Especially frustrating since some of the options the game presents can become auto-chosen based on your previous actions.
<ul><li> The worst of all of them is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">drink wine vs. don't drink wine choice</a>. If you choose to drink wine, then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Durer claims you as a sex-slave and the game ends</span>. If you don't drink the wine, then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> you lose any hope of living and the game ends</span>. The only choice that leads to the wine scene is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign">choosing to prepare leather instead of the tools while making shoes in a totally unrelated scene</a>. Fortunately, it is a Visual Novel, so the player is bound to have save states from before the leather scene, and the game gives enough hints at the player for it to deduce choosing leather before tools was the choice where things went downhill. After you make the choice.
</li></ul></li><li> The entire idea of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/LongLiveTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/LongLiveTheQueen">Long Live the Queen</a></em> is this. You're hopelessly unqualified for this situation and everyone is trying to kill you. You're going to die a lot. As soon as you manage the skills and choices necessary to dodge one terrible fate, you're probably going to trigger another. Take notes or get used to staring at the game over screen.
</li><li> Finding your way to the True End of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/NineHoursNinePersonsNineDoors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/NineHoursNinePersonsNineDoors">Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors</a></em> requires choosing different doors at several branching paths and going through several potential endings. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">You can't get the real ending on the first try - Akane needs the information she gathers from each trial run to figure out the correct path that will save her life.</span>
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/VirtuesLastReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/VirtuesLastReward">Virtue's Last Reward</a></em> is more forgiving since you can use the Flow screen to go back to a previous scene instead of having to play through from the beginning. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, you still have to play through all the endings to get the game's real ending.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ZeroTimeDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ZeroTimeDilemma">Zero Time Dilemma</a></em>, there's a decision game in Team C's route that requires them to roll 3 dice and have them all end in 1, them being excecuted if even one of the die ends up in a different number. There's no trick or alternate solution at all; the game does expect you to roll three dice and have them all land in 1 in one try. Probablity is not in your favour, and you'll more than likely die in your first tries. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Subverted in two different ways: first, you have a roughly 1/3 chance to get the roll right as opposed to the actual probability, and you're basically guaranteed to get all dice land in 1 on your third or fourth try. Secondly, the timeline where Team C loses the roll is fundamental to get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission">Stealth-Based Mission</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/CorpsePartyCrossFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/CorpsePartyCrossFear">Corpse Party: Cross Fear</a></em> includes a point where your only clue as to when it's safe to move is a series of audial clues. There is NO indication of which sound signifies it's safe to move, nor of how much time you get before you're automatically discovered and killed. Without a guide, your only recourse is guessing and hoping for the best... and dying a lot.
</li><li> <em>Big Bang Age</em> is rather straightforward in the School chapter and the Regional chapter. Once you reach the National chapter, on the other hand, you're going to be doing a lot of reloading. That odd schoolgirl who tells you she's with a certain council and that she wants you to pay them a visit? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">If you blow her off, <em>every faction in the game goes hostile</em>.</span> Took that one seemingly-harmless region? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Factions go hostile a few turns after you take neutral spaces next to their territory.</span> Expect to start over a few times.
<ul><li> A particularly painful example happens near the end of the game. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thought that you would automatically be taken to the final boss after reaching the deadline of 100 days? Nope, you need to conquer Shinjuku (which is spitting out up to six demons per turn and requiring a lot of resources to so much as <em>hold</em>) to get the event to proceed with the story. Saved on the end of the 99th day? Loading that save immediately sends you to a cutscene and the game over screen.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Deiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Deiz">Deiz</a></em> has thirteen possible endings. Good luck getting all of them without a walkthrough, since the choices that lead up to each can be arbitrary sometimes. For instance, the difference between <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">your best friend consoling you after you learn that your crush loves someone else</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">your best friend locking you in his room to try an "experiment"</span> is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">how you respond to said crush earlier in the game when she first talks to you.</span> Even worse since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">your best friend wasn't even there for the decision, so it shouldn't reasonably have an effect on his behavior.</span>
</li><li> The fan-made visual novel, <em>CLANNAD: The Past Path</em>, suffers from a pretty severe case of this. All but two of the endings are bleak, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a>-crossing conclusions, and you're usually one wrong choice away from them. The final choice point in the main heroine's route is particularly sadistic in this regard, as the wrong decision results in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the protagonist's suicide, and you won't even know you've made a mistake until you've already gone through virtually the entire third act of the game.</span>
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://ooctaff.tumblr.com/post/96885519271/welcome-to-illusionary-trauma-trigger-warning">Illusionary Trauma<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> states that it's pretty much mandatory to save after everything due to how easy it is to die. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">That said, it helps set the mood better.</a>
</li><li> While few people try it, preferring to rely on walkthroughs, correctly mapping out how to find the various side routes and special endings in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/KaraNoShoujo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/KaraNoShoujo">Kara no Shoujo</a></em> requires trying every option, writing down what happens, and then reloading to try the other ones. Most of the main plot can be reached through common sense deductions. Side routes require collecting every optional appearance of that particular character in order to unlock the final scenes, and there is literally NO way to know where and when those characters will appear other than visiting every place on the map and making notes of who was present on that date.
