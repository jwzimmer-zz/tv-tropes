<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, Orihime is regretful that the last time she spoke to her brother Sora before he died, they fought, and she let him go off to work without saying goodbye. In fact, when she finally gets a chance to see Sora's spirit one last time, at the proper moment of goodbye she tells him "Have a nice day," like she always did except for <em>that</em> day. Cue the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a>.
<ul><li> At some point, Yoruichi Shihouin ran away from Soul Society after her best friend, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> Kisuke Urahara, was exiled. That did NOT suit Yoruichi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">Lancer</a> and pupil, Soi Fon, who grew <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">embittered and cold</a> after her idol left. When they finally met again and Yoruichi defeated Soi Fon, the normally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl">stoic</a> Soi Fon broke down in tears, hysterically begging her mentor to explain why she abandoned her without asking her to come along or even saying goodbye.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam">Mobile Fighter G Gundam</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Rain had to immediately leave her university when her dad called her back to Neo-Japan due to the incident involving Domon's family. She was getting ready for a meeting with Saette, a classmate of hers who had something important to tell her. (He had feelings for her but the full nature of their relationship is never stated.) Regardless, he mistook this as a sign of rejection. She never returned due to getting caught up with Domon and his situation and when they met each other again, Saette was the Gundam Fighter for Neo Turkey. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">It got worse</a>.</span>
</li><li> Subverted in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack">Black Jack</a></em> OVA, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Crossword, a mortally ill man, just before going down to his laboratory for an experiment during the disease attack he knows to be final, remembers that he forgot to say "Good morning" to his wife. He then notably dismisses this as unimportant, as "Upsetting myself would only dull your scalpel". He just says "Good morning, Sayuri" out loud instead of coming back up to talk to her.</span>
</li><li> Narrowly averted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwiceShy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwiceShy">Yoshiko Fujisawa and Hikaru Matsuyama</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa">Captain Tsubasa</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She didn't want to either distract him from the Furano v/s Nankatsu match and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TryingNotToCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TryingNotToCry">cry in front of him</a>, so she left to the airport without a word when the match was barely over... but Matsuyama learnt about it and raced against the clock to catch her before her flight to the USA took off. He succeeded</span>.
<ul><li> A non-romantic example is played straight in the first part, with Roberto and a 12-year-old Tsubasa. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Roberto left without saying a word to not separate Tsubasa from his friends and family and to not stunt his growth as a player.</span> Cue to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a> as Tsubasa has a Heroic BSOD.
</li><li> Also played straight in the manga, with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hyuga recalling how he was not being able to say goodbye to his dad since Hyuga Sr. died in a road accident in his way home when Hyuga himself was 10. The kicker? He recalls it when his <em>mom</em> is seriously ill and on the verge of death.</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Sob!</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/CLANNAD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/CLANNAD">CLANNAD</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TearJerker/CLANNAD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TearJerker/CLANNAD">milks it for all it's worth</a> and then some with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kotomi Ichinose and her dead parents.</span>
</li><li> This is a major theme in the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FragmentsNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FragmentsNote">Fragment's Note</a></em>. Depending on the route, either Yukitsuki or Tsukasa give Kyoichi a scathing lecture about how, knowing that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he's terminally ill</span>, he needs to provide more happy memories to Shizuku before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his death</span>, or else she will succumb to despair due to not having such a chance.
<ul><li> It's implied that in the original, unaltered timeline, Yukitsuki experienced this when she tried to interact with Kyoichi. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's also the core reason why Kazuha went back in time in the first place.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gankutsuou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gankutsuou">Gankutsuou</a></em>, Franz not only didn't say goodbye to his father who had to leave on business during his birthday, he also told his father that he hopes he never comes back. Oops when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">his father dies in a car accident</a>...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em> during TSR, this is pretty much the thing that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gauron</span> takes drastic measures and an incredible amount of planning to prevent from happening to himself with Sousuke. It wouldn't be too far off to assume that the only thing that probably was sustaining him and keeping him alive was his desire to see Sousuke for one last time, and he even goes so far as to order the complete destruction of a city just so he could lure Sousuke and have some last words with him. Sousuke, on the other hand, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyWontYouDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyWontYouDie">could have done without seeing him again...</a>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kamina</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yoko</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kamina</span> died in battle with an unfulfilled promise to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yoko</span>. They did get to meet again though, in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">Lotus-Eater Machine</a>. By the word of the creators, their meeting was arranged "to reunite two people in the place that has separated them".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em>, Tohru explains to Shigure that while her mother Kyoko was alive, she would always tell her "Goodbye, be safe!" But the one morning when Tohru wasn't awake at the time her mother left, Kyoko died.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Tohru:</strong> I... I had a test. I studied almost the whole night. And when it was time for Mom to go to work, I didn't wake up. I couldn't tell her "Bye! Be safe!" And she...never came home.
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LegendOfHeavenlySphereShurato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LegendOfHeavenlySphereShurato">Legend of Heavenly Sphere Shurato</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lakshu</span> says this word by word when she's told that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ryuu-oh Ryoma</span> died in battle.
<div class="indent">"<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ryoma</span>... he died... and I didn't get to say goodbye to him..."
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em>, this is how Flay felt about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kira after his supposed death</span>. It isn't until the final episode when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Flay dies and her spirit "tells" Kira all the things she could never say in life; however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that this scene was entirely symbolic, and no actual communication took place.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em>, Saori tells Miho that the last time Mako saw her mother before her parents died in an accident, Mako and her mother had an argument, and Mako has always regretted not being able to apologize.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MuhyoAndRoji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MuhyoAndRoji">Muhyo and Roji</a></em>, Nana's father <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngerBornOfWorry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngerBornOfWorry">got angry with her</a> after she got a photo of a bank robbery, putting herself in danger in the process. She then called him "gutless" for anonymously selling fake photos of ghosts, and said she was trying to help. As she stormed off, he suffered a heart attack and died. Similar to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a> example, he comes back as a haunt and they end up reconciling.
</li><li> The dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> makes this more apparent, but Eren was pretty angry with himself that his last moments with his mom before Shiganshina fell were spent arguing with her.
</li><li> Non-lethal, but no less heart-wrenching example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HyperdimensionNeptuniaTheAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HyperdimensionNeptuniaTheAnimation">Hyperdimension Neptunia the Animation</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint">Peashy</a> is kidnapped after a fight with her surrogate mother Neptune, and when they next meet, is brainwashed to the point she doesn't remember her. Even when she's rescued, Peashy's memory is gone, leaving Neptune unable to apologize before Peashy is taken to her home dimension permanently. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Just to pour salt into the wound, Peashy DOES remember Neptune... at literally the last second before she vanishes forever.</span>
</li><li> In the original series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, after hearing that Master Roshi died fighting King Piccolo while he was gone, Goku becomes depressed that he didn't get to say goodbye.
</li><li> A big part of the reason why Rinne had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedToBeASweetKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedToBeASweetKid">a change of personality</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VividStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VividStrike">ViVid Strike!</a></em> was because she couldn't be there when her adoptive grandfather died <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> due to a group of bullies knocking her unconscious when her mother was trying to call her. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheQuietOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheQuietOnes">Needless to say</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">the bullies would come to regret it</a>.</span>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YourName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YourName">Your Name</a></em> side novel <em>Another Side: Earthbound</em> reveals that Toshiki had been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedFromDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedFromDeath">Distracted from Death</a>, having been out trying to find other doctors to cure Futaba, and therefore had to settle for hearing her last words secondhand from a nurse, as opposed to getting to bid her farewell in person. This presumably contributed to his present-day issues.

</li><li> Common in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug">Miraculous Ladybug</a></em> future fics, which often involve Ladybug and Chat Noir being forced to give up their Miraculous immediately after defeating Hawkmoth/Papillon and leaving them with no way to contact their partner unless they'd revealed themselves already. Such stories will usually result in Marinette and Adrien being reunited years later, and depending on the circumstances, will either lead to a fluffy happy ending or a lot of pain and angst due to one of them feeling abandoned.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Fermeture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Fermeture">Fermeture</a></em> is a standout example of the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">former</span> category, which opens several years after Hawkmoth's defeat with Marinette living a good life by any standard, but occasionally consumed by regret over never revealing her identity to Chat Noir or letting him do the same when they had the chance - it's stated that she'd tried and failed to find him in the brief window after Tikki told her why she and Plagg would have to leave but before they actually did. She decides to try to set up a reunion with him through the Ladyblog, hoping for some kind of closure. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">She ultimately succeeds when Adrien shows up</a>, (no doubt having had the exact same regrets) though she comes very close to leaving without either of them making the connection</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/SomethingInTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/SomethingInTheNight">Something in the Night</a></em> takes a different approach by <em>not</em> having the characters stripped of their Miraculouses. In this case, the heroes tried to set up a meeting the day after Hawkmoth's defeat, but due to some poor planning and a lot of bad luck, Marinette ends up stuck in traffic on the other side of Paris and is unable to get to the park later due to a flight to New York scheduled that afternoon (she held off on telling Chat Noir about her study plans so as not to add pressure on him in their efforts to capture Hawkmoth). Adrien, who did make it to the park, feels abandoned, and when Ladybug does reappear in Paris seven years later, he's not exactly willing to hear her out.
</li><li> A much more painful variant appears in <em><a class="urllink" href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/8823994/">Bring Me Home<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, in which Adrien is stubbornly <em>refusing</em> to say goodbye, or anything else, despite Ladybug persistently showing up at their former meeting place five years after Chat disappeared. His reason for this is out of shame that his father was Hawkmoth, as he believes that Ladybug would reject him if she learned his identity, for failing to figure out his father. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Marinette does find out, she's appropriately pissed at the fact that he apparently trusted his partner so little. "Even when Hawkmoth was strangling me, even as I was losing consciousness, I wasnt afraid. I knew  I <em>thought</em>  that youd always come for me, or die trying. You, on the other hand, didnt even have enough faith in me to believe Id stay by your side when things got difficult. What kind of a crappy partner have I been to you if you honestly believed Id jump the ship at the first bump?</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RuinedWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RuinedWithYou">Ruined With You</a></em> is another case of the heroes being forced to give up the Miraculous to the Guardian to allow their kwamis to hibernate, but here Adrien gives it up at the first opportunity instead of waiting for Ladybug, again out of shame about his father. As such, Marinette doesn't have quite as much trouble moving on with her life, since she knows for sure that she won't be seeing Chat again. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> That said, when she does find out who he is, she's pretty furious that he never tried to contact her through the Guardian in two years. She later feels guilty about lashing out at him, after she has time to process the implications about his father.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/BackToUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/BackToUs">Back To Us</a></em> has Adrien being forced to leave the country shortly after Gabriel/Hawkmoth's death, ending up in the custody of his aunt and uncle in Milan, and he has no opportunity to tell Ladybug any of this. While Ladybug certainly misses him, she doesn't dwell on it quite as much as some of the above examples. And when he does return, she's less focused on feeling abandoned than his personality change over the last seven years.

Not that this is softened any once the two actually reunite in-story- if anything, the things they wind up doing for each other out of affection make the situation <em>worse</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> fanfic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ThePeaceNotPromised" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ThePeaceNotPromised">The Peace Not Promised</a></em>, Lily <em>thinks</em> that she missed her chance to say goodbye before the Grey Lady passed on.

<ul><li> Those from House Stark who have died did so with only a few of their family present. Lord Rickard and Brandon were executed in King's Landing while Ned was on the Eyrie, Benjen at Winterfell, and Lyanna captive at Dorne. Only Ned was present at Lyanna's deathbed in Dorne, though it is later revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a baby Jon Snow</span> was also present as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his mother</span> Lyanna had just <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">given birth to him and Ned holds Jon in his arms at Lyanna's bedside</span>. Ned is executed with only his daughters present. The others are either at Winterfell (Bran and Rickon), at Castle Black (Jon), beyond the Wall (Benjen), or marching towards King's Landing (Robb and Catelyn). The Red Wedding happens with Jon, Bran, and Rickon somewhere near the Wall, Sansa at King's Landing, Benjen missing beyond the Wall, and Arya just outside the venue while the event is taking place. Jon is murdered in a mutiny at Castle Black, obviously without any of his family. Interestingly, Jon reunites with Sansa two episodes after his resurrection. Only Jon is present when Rickon is killed by Ramsay. By the time Sansa arrives, she only sees Rickon's corpse.

Her father, Big Daddy, calls her and asks her to come and visit, and she declines because she's been made the Belle of the Citrus Festival Ball. The next call Blanche gets is from her sister, Virginia, telling her that Big Daddy has passed away. Initially, in denial, Blanche is finally forced to face the fact that her father <em>is</em> dead and that she <em>didn't</em> come when he wanted her, but then lets her pride get in the way again when Virginia calls her out for her selfishness and Blanche angrily refuses to attend the funeral. She finally has to settle for a quick, but heartfelt and regretful, farewell at Big Daddy's gravesite.
<ul><li> Blanche gets hit with this again in "Mrs. George Devereaux." Her latest secret admirer turns out to be none other than her presumably deceased husband George, who admits to faking his own death to escape his business partner framing him for fraud. Reeling from the news, Blanche reveals this trope twofold. First, she says that she's always regretted her last thoughts about him: when she went to answer a phone call, she inadvertently tripped over his shoes and snapped "Damn it, George, I just hate you!"—only to discover the call was from a police officer telling her there'd been a fatal accident. She further tells the Girls that her pain at this has manifested in a series of recurring dreams where she gets to see George again, apologize, and tell him that she loves him, only to wake up just before she can hug him one last time. Towards the end of the episode, Blanche finally comes to terms with the fact that George is back, tells him how much she's missed him, and rushes into his arms for a hug—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamShot">and we cut to her waking up alone in her bed</a>, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">the entire episode was an example of Blanche's recurring dream</a>. Surprisingly, though, Blanche realizes that she <em>did</em> get to hug George this time, and hopes that this means she has at long last made peace with his death and can begin to move on.

He reveals that though he cheated throughout their marriage and has had two wives since leaving her, she'll <em>always</em> be the true love of his life, and he couldn't let her walk down the aisle without giving her a proper confession and goodbye. Dorothy is deeply moved, and he proceeds to take her to the chapel with pride.

It is strongly implied throughout the show that Jake Keaton had died of a terminal illness (referring back to a Season 1 episode), but more importantly, the trope kicks into effect in that Steven  who had quarreled with his father  never had a true chance to make peace with him before his death.

Of course, the real reason he couldn't let go is that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault">blamed himself</a> for her joining the expedition in the first place. His sister Lizzie eventually gives him Anna's last communication to <em>her</em>, which reveals that Anna was going to go on the expedition anyway, and also shows Anna expressing her love of John in the ways he wished he'd expressed for her. It's somewhat painful for him to watch, but it helps him to move on.
</li><li> Ivanova has similar regrets regarding Marcus. Marcus, however, did get to say "I love you" to a dying Ivanova, leading to the touching yet funny line, "I thought: God really does have an English accent, just like in those old movies."

Also, Sarah Jane Smith calls him on never properly saying goodbye to her face, something the Doctor was notorious for doing in regards to his companions, but when she leaves in "School Reunion", she makes him say goodbye so that she can have closure.

You always will meet people from around the world who are from different countries and different cultures. Many people will talk to each other on Skype and become really close, yet they never meet each other (even if many of them tell each other they'll meet each other in real life one day). But with having online friends, the one thing that is terrible is that online friends may one day leave without notice forever. And sometimes it can be heartbreaking for you, especially if that person became close to you.
