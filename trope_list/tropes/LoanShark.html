The loan shark may be only too eager to use violence if necessary. He may also have mob connections, as money-lending is a time-honored means for organized crime to use money gotten from any number of less-than-honest means, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilDebtCollector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilDebtCollector">hounding of their victims for payment and interest</a> is just another means of extortion. In some cases, a loan shark will be reluctant to kill a debtor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">because a corpse can't pay its dues</a>, while other times the loan shark would be gleeful to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">cut them into pieces</a> so they can put their rare, precious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganTheft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganTheft">organs</a> on the black market.
</p><p>Loan sharks feature a lot in action movies, where they're usually tied to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">The Mafia</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTriadsAndTheTongs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTriadsAndTheTongs">The Triads and the Tongs</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a> or whatever other organized crime group features as the primary villain of the piece. Typically, the person being hounded by the loan sharks is someone who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedByGamblingDebts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedByGamblingDebts">ran up a nasty gambling debt</a> or needed money for some other reason and had nowhere else to turn, and now they are putting the heat on him to get their money back (with interest) and the borrower is unable to pay. Enter the hero, who is usually a friend of the borrower, who comes across the loan sharks doing their bit of nasty, beats the crap out of them and sends them packing. The loan sharks get pissed and the conflict ensues.

Actual banks, within the United States and its allies at least, do <em>not</em> operate under this trope and will in fact often accept pennies on the dollar rather than have to repossess cars and houses. Bankers do not want to own your collateral because they tend to have trouble selling it to get their money (doing so was what caused the sub-prime mortgage crisis and subsequent depression of 2008) and even in boom markets, owning property to sell is often costlier than most banks want to deal with. Also of note is payday lending, which, due to its legality in the US, does not involve violence but is less lenient than banks.

<ul><li> Half the premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler">Hayate the Combat Butler</a></em> is that the hero's parents, being pursued by exactly these kinds of loan sharks in the form of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a> (a.k.a. the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism">Very Nice People</a>), agree to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring">sell him to them for his organs</a></em> without his knowledge in order to repay their debt.
<ul><li> Although that plotline is closed up in short order it's likely that both <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hinagiku and Yukiji's parents and Luka have had dealings with these same type of people.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BinbouShimaiMonogatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BinbouShimaiMonogatari">Binbou Shimai Monogatari</a></em> has a father who ran away from a dangerous debt.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out that he's paying his friend's debt, not his own</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ParanoiaAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ParanoiaAgent">Paranoia Agent</a></em> owes the Yakuza a large amount of money. And it just keeps getting larger.
</li><li> A running theme in seinen manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WaGaNaWaUmishi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WaGaNaWaUmishi">Wa Ga Na Wa Umishi</a></em> is how they are ever going to pay off the astronomical $14 million debt they owe the bank. The slimy loan officer never fails to turn up to collect most of their earning whenever they do a succesful job.
</li><li> Disaster survivors such as Faye Valentine of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em> didn't get their cryogenic treatment for free.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a></em>. One of the cons run by Teppei and Rina. Teppei will lend money to gamblers. After they lose it, Rina will offer to loan them money so they can pay him back. True, the interest rate is downright extortionate, but being in debt to her is better than being in debt to him, right?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> Paulie makes his entrance while being chased down a public street by a pair of suits demanding money. Apparently this happens a lot.
</li><li> One could argue that Nami's original reason for stealing money was due to this, since she was attempting to buy her village free from Arlong and his fish-men. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AstonishinglyAppropriateAppearance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AstonishinglyAppropriateAppearance">Bonus points for Arlong being an actual shark</a>, too.
<ul><li> Nami herself also counts after she's freed from Arlong. Her typical lending rate is 300% interest, and if any situation involves scoring some extra cash, she goes from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> to no less reckless than the rest of her crew.
</li></ul></li><li> 'Arlong' even sounds like the Chinese dialect Hokkien phrase for 'loanshark' (at least in Singaporean Hokkien, see Live Action TV below).
</li><li> One filler episode features a more heroic example, with a retired moneylender who used to lend money to pirates. Most of the pirates would try to just abscond without paying him back, at which point he chased after them to take it back by force.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akumetsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akumetsu">Akumetsu</a></em> kicks off with the initial female lead (who fades out of the story after a while) renting/selling herself into teenage prostitution because of her father's crushing debt, caused by a loan-sharking bank. At first it was indicated that her parents had sold her, a la Hayate above, but later it emerges that they have no idea she even knows how dire their financial straits are. The girl is rescued by Akumetsu, who kills the central bureaucratic fat cat with an axe before having his head blown off. A later arc involves Akumetsu taking on the leaders of various banks in a shame-and-threaten campaign on national television after running across the girl's father contemplating suicide by revenge-with-large-truck in a playpark on his way to school.
</li><li> Garome from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em>, who even sends thugs after <em>children</em>. When forced to duel, his deck theme concentrates on loaning creatures to his opponent, then doing massive damage to them each turn if they can't get rid of the creatures.
</li><li> The Otogi Bank from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/OokamiSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/OokamiSan">Ōkami-san</a></em> functions this way, although they deal in social debts and not finances.
</li><li> One entire manga is about loan sharks, <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaniwaKinyudo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaniwaKinyudo">Naniwa Kinyudo</a></em>, though from a more realistic perspective - they operate legally if exploitatively, charging extremely high interest to desperate people, sometimes merely making sure they will get ahold of the collateral, but also doing things like manipulating them to take second jobs or go into prostitution.
</li><li> More than one of these appear in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a>. Unsurprisingly, they <strong>all</strong> become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victims</a> of their cases. Of special note is the pawn shop owner Akira Sumida, who is such a bitch that at least <em>three</em> people want her head.
</li><li> Tom of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em> is a pleasant, even-tempered man who works in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoanShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoanShark">Loan Shark</a> business for some Yakuza-types. He doesn't like using violence and generally relies on his super-strong and hot tempered friend/partner Shizuou to frighten recalcitrant customers.
</li><li> Those in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kaiji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kaiji">Kaiji</a></em> are quite happy to pursue not only their debtors but also those who have co-signed for them in nefarious ways.
</li><li> The basic premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CControl">[C] - Control</a></em> is that mysterious beings loan people large amounts of money, with the condition that they must then gamble it in weekly inter-dimensional tournaments. Go bankrupt, and you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone">lose your future, literally</a>. The resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoanShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoanShark">Loan Shark</a> person, Masakaki, even regularly displays shark teeth when being particularly greedy.
</li><li> While Knuckle from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em> isn't an <em>actual</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoanShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoanShark">Loan Shark</a>, his nen ability, Hakoware, is themed this way. Every time he hits an opponent, he lends them some of his nen, making them more powerful. But the loaned nen accrues interest every ten seconds, and if the opponent don't hit him back to return the nen he gave them, they'll eventually go over a certain limit and "bankrupt", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerNullifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerNullifier">losing their nen for a month.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter">City Hunter</a></em> has an old man trying to rob the Yakuza loan sharks who bankrupted him and ruined his life. Thanks to having used his last money to hire the best courier of Tokyo's underground to drive the getaway car and said courier having hired Ryo as a bodyguard, he not only succeeds and gets away with it but gets the satisfaction of seeing the car of the Yakuza enforcers wrecked.
</li><li> Part of the reason Hayate from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateXBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateXBlade">Hayate X Blade</a></em> joins her school's sword-fighting tournament in place of her injured sister is because a group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a> loan sharks left their old orphanage under a mountain of debt.
</li><li> The Twilight Ogre guild in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> operates this way. When Fairy Tail falls on hard times, Twilight Ogre offers them money, then spends the next seven years harassing them and destroying their property when they fail to pay back all their interest. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After their strongest members return after getting frozen in time and find out what happened, Fairy Tail <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">pays them back</a>, all right—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">in terms of all the suffering and damages their guild sustained over all those years</a>. Twilight Ogre promptly leaves them alone after that.</span>
</li><li> Drakken Joe from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/EdensZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/EdensZero">EDENS ZERO</a></em> is the head honcho of a civilian space fortress whose residents are all completely swamped in debt to him. When one unlucky sap owes him millions, Drakken's response is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackTheMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackTheMouth">mess up his mouth with a broken glass bottle</a> before offering to let him suffer any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a> of his choice until he can finally pay him back.

Tony then "busts out" Scatino's store, buying random crap and exhausting its assets and lines of credit until it is forced into Chapter 7 bankruptcy (liquidation). (Scatino says in-universe it's going to be Chapter 11. While he may have intended to file for Chapter 11—reorganization of debts, with creditors to be repaid from future profits—we very clearly see the liquidators roll into the store, take everything, and put up a "for lease" sign, so we can be reasonably sure that even if he filed an 11, it was converted to a 7). This culminates when Tony, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">a genius move</a>, gives Meadow an SUV that he took as collateral from Scatino, <em>her boyfriend's father</em>.
<ul><li> This situation actually presents a very peculiar circumstance for a bankruptcy attorney: after the "bust-out", Scatino's debts must have been <em>staggering</em>, but in theory at least, all the crap Scatino's business "gave" for the mobsters to sell (or take for themselves) were a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraudulent_conveyance">fraudulent transfer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> or an <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfair_preference">unfair preference<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, so David and/or the trustee would be well within their rights to sue Tony to make him give the money back, and Scatino would win given the amount of evidence in his favor (then again, who in their right mind sues a mobster?). The FBI could've also used this as a means to flip David.

<ul><li> Wilson Fisk's father borrows from a mob boss, Don Rigoletto, to fund his campaign for city council, with the expectation that Bill Fisk will pay back Rigoletto through kickbacks. Unfortunately, Bill's asshole nature costs him the election, and little Wilson kills him with a hammer shortly thereafter. Wilson and his mother then cut the body up and dump it, with it being implied that this is to avoid retribution from Rigoletto. Then again, the comics and some dialogue in season 1 show that Fisk afterwards went to work for Rigoletto, possibly to pay off his father's debts at first.
</li><li> In the present day, season 1 opens with Fisk having recently killed Rigoletto and taken over his loansharking rackets. James Wesley makes his introduction strongarming a corrupt jail guard who owes $30,000 to the recently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism">retired</a> Rigoletto into carrying out a hit on Karen Page in exchange for his debts being forgiven, threatening the man's daughter to secure his cooperation. The hit fails, with Karen drawing blood from one of his eyes with her nails, so after having him bailed out, Fisk has him killed and his death staged to look like a suicide.
</li><li> A twisted example happens in season 3, when Fisk goes after Foggy's brother and parents to get leverage over Foggy. He does so by directing the various suppliers who have contracts with the Nelsons' butcher shop to stop doing business with them. After several months, the shop is driven into a tight financial spot, where they don't have enough collateral to get a loan from the bank. It is then that Fisk has his contacts at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorallyBankruptBanker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorallyBankruptBanker">Red Lion National Bank</a> reach out to Theo and his parents. The loan officer tricks them into cooking their books and making their assets look healthier than they really are, enabling the loan to go through without a hitch. With evidence of Foggy's family committing fraud to blackmail Foggy with, Fisk lets their old suppliers resume business with them. Things go by smoothly until Foggy begins campaigning for DA in response to Fisk's release from prison, and a viral video surfaces of him humiliating Blake Tower in a public forum while listing the various crimes Fisk has been committing since he got out. In response to this, Fisk sends <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilBrit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilBrit">Felix Manning</a> to Nelson's Meats and has him threaten to have Red Lion call the loan and send Foggy's family to jail if Foggy doesn't retract the public claims he's been making about Fisk.

</li><li> During the 19th century, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheUnitedStates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheUnitedStates">The United States</a>, salary lenders loaned money to regularily employed persons, and used public shaming when they didn't pay up.

</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRoaringTwenties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRoaringTwenties">The Roaring '20s</a>, after limitations on interest rates were enacted, some loaners <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">used the excuse</a> that they were not loaning money but that they were just buying the salaries of their debtors.
</li><li> According to "<a class="urllink" href="http://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4277&amp;context=wlulr">Loan Sharks, Interest-Rate Caps, and Deregulation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>", the term "loan shark" didn't originally mean "lender who charges high interest and uses physical violence (i.e. brute force) to charge when the debtors don't pay up on time", but rather "lender who charges high interest and sets low payment periods so that debtors will end up perpetually paying interest, as well as collecting on the debt agressively but not physically violently, by means of harassment (e.g. telling the neighbours or the boss that the debtor owed money)". It notes that the modern meaning of "loan shark" came up during the late 1950s and popularized itself in the 1960s, while the old meaning could still be heard as late as the 1980s.
</li><li> Payday loans are thought to be the legal side of loansharking, especially since the annual interest rates can go up to <em>40%</em>. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/content?oid=7610">In some cases<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the Mafia-related loanshark has lower interest rates than the ones from payday loaners. Attempts to crack down on the practice are routinely met with severe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a>.
</li><li> Japanese <em>sarakin</em> serve loans reimbursable in ten days, called <em>to-san</em> ('to' - meaning 'ten', for the number of days - and 'san' - meaning 'three' because the interest rate is of 30%) or <em>to-go</em> ('go' meaning 'five', because the interest rate is of 50%); their methods of collect include publicly shaming the debtor or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilDebtCollector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilDebtCollector">showing up to marriages or funerals</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">driven some to suicide</a>.
<ul><li> And while the Japanese government <em>has</em> reigned in on the supposedly legal ones, with interest rates capped at 20% for those (which partly drove the most notorious of these, Takefuji, to bankruptcy), the ones of more dubious legality still exist.
</li></ul></li><li> Likewise, in South East Asia, <em>Ah Long</em> loan money at 40% <em>per month</em> and paint O$P$ ("owe money, pay money") on delinquent debtors' houses. There have been cases where borrowers and their family members were beaten or had their property vandalized, and some were even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a>.
</li><li> More tragically, this is how people end in debt bondage. Some Indian loansharks loan money at 100% per year: for example, <a class="urllink" href="http://thecnnfreedomproject.blogs.cnn.com/2011/06/02/a-110-loan-then-20-years-of-debt-bondage/">this farmer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> ended enslaved for 20 years after being loaned $110.

<ul><li> Loansharking still remains a popular racket for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMafia">The Mafia</a>. In fact, gambling, bookmaking, and loansharking go together like "peanut butter and jelly." They naturally complement one another and follow suit, as degenerate gamblers will be referred to a shylock to pay off their gambling debts. This slowly becomes a rinse-and-repeat cycle until the gambler is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedByGamblingDebts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedByGamblingDebts">Trapped by Gambling Debts</a>. They offer in several varieties:
<ul><li> Some shylocks will lend money to other loansharks at 1% per week, which they will then push it out to debtors at 2%-3%.
</li><li> The "knockdown" loan is the dominant form of loansharking. It involves a fixed schedule of payment, both interest and principle. It's very similar to a legitimate mortgage, but the interest paid is astronomical.
</li><li> The "vigorish" or "juice" loan is the other type. It requires that the borrower make the stated weekly interest payments until such time as he pays the principal (or remaining portion of it, if the loan shark permits partial principal payments).
