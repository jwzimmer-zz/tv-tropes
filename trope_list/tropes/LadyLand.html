Lady Land extends the idea to an extreme level.
</p><p>In a Lady Land, the population is predominantly female. Males may be considered inferior, used as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">sex slaves</a>, or even expelled or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gendercide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gendercide">murdered</a>. This may create problems by leaving said society with no obvious method of reproducing outside of the sex slaves option. There's a very good chance that this issue will be brought up in-story, along with the issue of what happens to any male children born in a no-males zone. Some stories explore how a culture is affected by the absence of men by giving the characters other motivations. Other stories take it to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalExtreme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalExtreme">Logical Extreme</a> as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">Author Tract</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser">how women are better off</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfairSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfairSex">without men</a>.

In fact, this ultimately leads to the threat of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarOfEarthlyAggression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarOfEarthlyAggression">The War of Earthly Aggression</a> that drives the series' plot. Much of Mars' human population is male and when the feminist political group <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">finds out that Martians have succeeded in producing "Thirds", a category of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobot">Ridiculously Human Robot</a> that goes beyond a mere <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexBot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexBot">Sex Bot</a> to being able to <em>reproduce with humans</em>, they demand Mars cease producing Thirds and destroy the ones it has created, or else they will invade and force them to do. Even before open warfare erupts, they are willing to send assassins and saboteurs to force Martian compliance.</span>
</li><li> One chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FrankenFran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FrankenFran">Franken Fran</a></em> has Fran visiting an island that Professor Madaraki once helped out. It's a society of women who reproduce via parthogenesis; a few miles away is an island of men who do the same thing. Fran discovers a majority of both sides want to reunite and arranges for them to do so... whereupon jealousy takes over (of the "You slept with my <em>sister</em>?!?" variety) and both sides exterminate each other to the last person. There's a bright spot, however - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hermaphrodite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hermaphrodite">hermaphrodite</a> children survive.</span>

And of course, the guy who is allergic to girls ends up there, and promptly runs away (the series' resident Kuno wannabe, however, is promptly kicked off of the moon when he ends up there).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GunXSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GunXSword">GUN×SWORD</a></em> has Misshogi, where men are forbidden and all the women wear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService">bathing suits</a> (the founder is a bathing-suit designer, and the name of the town is a homonym on <em>mizugi</em>). It's ultimately revealed this is the result of the founder reacting to her breakup <em>way</em> worse than usual. Made even worse to the fact that her boyfriend didn't break up with her, he just didn't like her new swimsuit design.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KunoichiTsubakiNoMuneNoUchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KunoichiTsubakiNoMuneNoUchi">Kunoichi Tsubaki No Mune No Uchi</a></em>: The setting of the story is a village that raises girls to become kunoichi, or female ninja. The girls are raised in seclusion from men to the point most don't understand what a man even <em>is</em>, being taught that men as a whole are beasts to be avoided. The premise of the manga is one girl, Tsubaki, becoming curious about men in spite of all this.
</li><li> The manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveGeneXX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveGeneXX">Love Gene XX</a></em> follows a similar premise to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YTheLastMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YTheLastMan">Y: The Last Man</a></em> in that it takes place in a future where all men were killed by a gender-specific contagion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture">20 Minutes into the Future</a>. Fast forward a few decades and humanity has to make do with "Project Eden," which (officially) aims to maintain civilization and societal norms entirely with females.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NagasareteAirantou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NagasareteAirantou">Nagasarete Airantou</a></em> is about an island with no men. When the male protagonist of the series accidentally winds up on the island, all the girls are so excited to have a male around that they do things like have tournaments to try to win the right to become his bride.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Kuja tribe consists entirely of women trained in the ways of the warrior. While it is stated that women of the island leave, return pregnant, <em>always</em> give birth to daughters, the population at large knows so little about men that it takes the eldest one in a group to even <em>identify</em> Luffy as male.
</li><li> In a semi-example, there is also the Momoiro Island, home to the Kamabakka Kingdom, where everybody is a transvestite. And guess <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert">which one</a> of the Straw Hats gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell">trapped there...</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ooku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ooku">Ooku</a>: the Inner Chambers</em> has Tokugawa Japan mutate into this after decades of ravages by an endemic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gendercide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gendercide">Red-faced Pox</a> that attacks only men. With a gender ratio of 1:4 in favor of women, men who make it to adulthood are barred from any remotely dangerous or strenuous occupations as "precious seed-bearers" while women have taken over all positions of authority.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/QueensBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/QueensBlade">Queen's Blade</a></em> can come off this way; while it's partially due to natural story slanting, females are expected to be warriors to the point where not only can only a woman rule the land entire, but becoming Queen is done by winning a once every four years battle royal tournament that is women only. However, it's made clear that this doesn't apply evenly throughout their world; the local Japan equivalent, while technically under a child empress, is ruled in truth by the male ministers.
</li><li> A common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">Fanon</a> view of the Joketsuzoku from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> is precisely this, based on the treatment of Mousse by Shampoo and Cologne, and by the fact that the <em>one</em> time we saw their village it was during a <em>women's-only</em> tournament. You might wonder why a genuinely misandrist society would have not executed an obsessed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> out of hand over his harassment of a woman who unambiguously and repeatedly rejects his advances in no uncertain terms. The term "Chinese Amazon" shouldn't be taken so literally, as it's more of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalTranslation">Cultural Translation</a>, and the name means something closer to "village of female warriors". Mousse is treated poorly mainly because he's an <em>idiot</em>. Possibly worth noting: we never see Shampoo's mother, but her (strangely beatnik-looking) <em>father</em> appears several times.
</li><li> Spoofed by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers Next</a></em>. To enter the town of Femille, all of the male characters (yes, even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComicallySerious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComicallySerious">Zelgadis</a></em>) need to disguise themselves as women. In the end, it turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">there are more men living in the town than expected, including the princess. In reality it has about the same male/female ratio as everywhere else they visit</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Vandread" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Vandread">Vandread</a></em> has planet Majarl. The reason the planet exist is, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the women there are bred to have unspoiled reproductive organs for the harvester fleets to claim.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em> Ice World or the Glacial Village is a floating island in Demon World that is an all female ice race that hates all men. Contact with men (especially the sexual kind) is forbidden. Hina left at one point and gave birth to a boy, Hiei, along with his sister Yukina. Hiei was quickly thrown to his death, as no men are allowed on the island. In the past when males were born they grew violent and the mother met a gruesome end. In the series Hiei also grew violent, but that could have been because he was raised by violent bandits and was left for dead at birth.
</li><li> The home planet of the Catians in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CatPlanetCuties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CatPlanetCuties">Cat Planet Cuties</a></em> is implied to be one, since they're said to have a natural female to male ratio of 20 to 1.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Artemyra</a> Kingdom in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagiLabyrinthOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagiLabyrinthOfMagic">Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic</a></em>.

Whether men are even allowed on the island is a question that is answered in different ways over the years. (The typical answer is "No, unless Wonder Woman invites them"; however, unlike the page image they will usually let a drowned, starving man into their hospital before deporting him). Also, there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">occasional jokes</a> about what the Amazons do for fun on an island inhabited only by women...

The most blatant example might be a male "starfleet" captain who caused a PR desaster being told to fix things and, "You're always claiming to be the equal of any female officer — prove it!". There's also deliberate flipping of stereotypes in some places, like a woman glued to the screen watching a car race while the man she lives with calls it silly and prepares to cook dinner.

After being captured, Mandrake attempts to regain their freedom by hypnotising one of the docile males into regaining his male dominance (which, curiously enough, involves making his man-skirt look like a pair of shorts). The man leads his fellow men in a revolt, overthrows the queen and establishes a "proper" male-controlled society... until the men go on a hunt and gets chased up a tree by a smug-looking boar.

<ul><li> The Pak'shree homeworld. Pak'shree are born neuter, become male at puberty (and spend their adolescence having sex and competing to do so), before becoming female at maturity. All Pakshree in authority are thus female by default. As male and immature are synonymous, Pak'shree often have trouble relating to males of other races without sounding (unintentionally) sexist. The inhabited worlds of the Cygnet system are also examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand">Lady Land</a>.
</li><li> Cygnet XIV, the Cygneti homeworld, was historically (22nd century) blatantly sexist towards males, with intellect and authority only ever considered feminine traits. This causes problems for male humans in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekEnterpriseRelaunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekEnterpriseRelaunch">Star Trek: Enterprise Relaunch</a>. Holor Sethe in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekTitan">Star Trek: Titan</a></em> series demonstrates that in some ways it hasn't changed too much by the 24th century. By the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekVoyagerRelaunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekVoyagerRelaunch">Star Trek: Voyager Relaunch</a></em>, the all-female Klingon warriors of the qawHaq'hoch have established their headquarters on Cygnet IV. Since Klingons are patriarchal, and usually Klingon females operating without any males would be seen as odd, Cygnet might well be the nearest system to Klingon space where no-one would blink to see an all-female quasi-political organization.
</li><li> The Megarite homeworld of Megara, where the ruling matriarchs are considered to be the more sophisticated of the species. They spend their lives sitting on beaches, doing little else, and consider travel to be "beneath" a female. The males are relegated to the distasteful realm of offworld trade and diplomacy, though many of them seem to enjoy it, being considerably more raucous and spontaneous than the somewhat stuffy females. Of course, there are exceptions, those Megarites who reject the traditional system. The young female Spring Rain On Still Water (in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekExMachina">Star Trek: Ex Machina</a></em>) prefers the more adventurous male life, and has been condemned by her matriarchs for "lowering" herself.

While government and the military are male-dominated and an infertile female faces ostracism, women dominate engineering and the sciences and often don't think males are smart enough to do those jobs.

They're gender-equal in theory, but in practice are mildly matriarchal: women outnumber men in the military and a male uses his mother's or wife's clan name. This is due to the lasting influence of the "Ruling Queen" Vriha t'Rehu, the first person to successfully claim rulership of Romulus and Remus (until the Remans overthrew her).

Due to their frustration at the treatment of women on Earth, the founding mothers on their newly adopted planet of Newholme create <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an artificial scarcity of female babies,</span> and a dominant ideology that females are the stronger sex and males are the weaker. This results in the women being in power and are regarded as more valuable than men. The women twist biology and psychology into an unsettling dogma that allows them to rule the population. The absurdity of this ideology (i.e men must wear veils so they won't incite lust in the women; men aren't seen in public and only work at home, because home is where they "belong") holds a mirror up to irrational and controlling nature of sexism in the real world.
</li><li> Played much more straight in Tepper's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGateToWomensCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGateToWomensCountry">The Gate to Women's Country</a></em>. The sexes are strictly separated; and the female ruling elite runs a program designed to breed out stereotypically "masculine" traits (aggression, dominance, etc). The sympathetic treatment of the female side, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">somewhat caricatured portrayal of males</a>, strongly indicates that this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">her idea of a feminist utopia</a>.

They are naturally incorrect and are captured, but fortunately the women are deeply curious about male/female culture, having only heard about it through legend and keep the men around to discuss it. On comparison, the outside world compares poorly to the sexuality-less eugenicist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySuetopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySuetopia">Mary Suetopia</a>, and one of the male characters refuses to take his girlfriend out to see it since he doesn't want to disappoint her.

</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EEDocSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EEDocSmith">E. E. Doc Smith</a>'s novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman">Second Stage Lensman</a></em>, the planet Lyrane II was ruled by women, who could be accurately described as highly telepathic Amazons. Their "males", by comparison, were almost dwarfish, subnormal in intelligence, and notably irrationally violent; their constant fighting among themselves (to the death, naturally) was seen as a form of "natural selection" by the ruling females. The "Persons" (as the Lyranian women referred to themselves) used the surviving males for breeding purposes (roughly one male to thirty "persons")- and then the last one "calmly blasted the male's mind and went about her business". The "persons" were quite capable of killing with mental force- well, except when the intended target was a Second Stage Lensman like Kimball Kinnison, that is. The fact that exactly none of the Lyranian "persons" was capable of even tolerating, let alone working with, a male of any species of Civilization for more than about three picoseconds (without at least trying to fry his brain) required the promotion of Clarissa MacDougall to Lensman in order to perform an important mission there. The Lyranians defined MacDougall as a "near-person", most obviously because while she (a) not only shared their mental prowess, but actually exceeded it (even before she became an "L2" in "Children of the Lens"), she also (b) did not regard males as nothing but animals and (c) did not share their unconcern about public nudity.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidBrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidBrin">David Brin</a>'s <em>Glory Season</em> takes place on a planet settled by separatist feminists who have been genetically engineered to have a different reproductive cycle than other humans. On this planet, if a woman conceives a child during the winter, she gives birth to a genetically identical clone of herself; if she conceives during the summer, she gives birth to a child who has genes from both parents. "Clans" of cloned women are the dominant forces in society, while males and non-clone females are marginalized. Interestingly enough, the author avoids portraying the planet as exclusively either a utopia or a dystopia, instead showing both good and bad aspects of the society and its members.
</li><li> Robert Jordan has an absolute field day with this in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">Wheel of Time</a></em> books. Almost everywhere else, to varying degrees, women are the ones in charge. Andor has many villages with Mayor/Town Council and Wisdom/Women's Circle dynamic, which are theoretically (<em>theoretically</em>, mind you) equal in power. In the Borderlands, it's often half-joked that "a woman's rights are what she says they are." The town of Far Madding has basically Renaissance attitudes gender-reversed (men are inherently inferior). Too many other examples to list. Most of this is accompanied by a degree of female chauvinism that (like the real life male equivalent) often borders, and crosses into, absolute absurdity.
<ul><li> Funnily enough, though, Far Madding is just about the only place in the series where all this chauvinism-flipping actually bears fruit in role changes, rather than just making standard-issue housewives mouthy and arrogant.
</li><li> For historical reasons, the ruler of Andor must be a queen (and the Lion Throne was built for a woman, so it's said no man can feel comfortable sitting in it). Both men and women can be High Seats of noble houses, however.
</li><li> Within the context of magic, this turns out to be justified - the male well of magical energy was actually poisoned by the Dark One in the last conflict between him and the Dragon. Men who wield magic are mentally and physically corrupted by the use of the magic. Before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Rand and Nynaeve destroy the taint on Saidin by pitting its destructive force against that of the corrupted city Shadar Logoth,</span> the only ways to save those male wizards were to neuter their power or place them in anti-magic zones called Steddings, but those drove them to suicide and culled magic from the general population. The Red Ajah, the sorority among Aes Sedai devoted to hunting down male Channelers, almost collapsed when they discovered how they'd brought the distribution of magical talent down from 10% of the population to several thousand people.

A secretive cabal held the technology for artificial impregnation (and the political power resulting from this monopoly), and they were not pleased about the prospect of reestablishing contact with men.

They reproduce by having a pact with several nomad tribes who, every few years, return to a meeting ground and mate with the women warriors; male children are given to the tribes (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism">"to the earth"</a>— i.e., killed), and females are kept and raised by the women.

Daughters are brought up in the household, sons who come of age are banished to fend for themselves so they don't threaten their father's position. And of course males aren't allowed into space because of their ostensibly fragile minds and hair-trigger tempers... (To be fair, it's hinted quite strongly that these attitudes are primarily a matter of tradition and upbringing and that Hani males <em>aren't</em> at the mercy of their biology.

When men are seen outside the home, they're always veiled to avoid inciting women, and escorted by armed sisters or wives.

The Amazons suffer horribly (so to speak) when the main protagonist and another young male in love independently around the same time seek to pass through the land as a man who refuses to mate and stay true to his loved one is considered a prize so rare that such a man can stay within its borders as long as desired and have virtually anything within reason he desires.

Ayla is the only one who seems to notice that the only women there who get pregnant are the ones who sneak out for covert liaisons with male lovers...

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OrdealInOtherwhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OrdealInOtherwhere">Ordeal in Otherwhere</a></em>, Charis Nordholm is brought to deal with them as a woman. The last woman had been driven mad by their psychic contact, but Charis is taken in and trained.

Heinlein</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpaceCadet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpaceCadet">Space Cadet</a></em> the intelligent species on Venus is a matriarchy and discussion of males strictly taboo. When the titular cadets are marooned near one tribe, Oscar Jensen, a Venusian native, refers to his colleagues as female when speaking to them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MARZENA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MARZENA">MARZENA</a></em>, the Starcloud HQ Building is pretty much this, with both human ladies and robot ladies of course.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hellspark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hellspark">Hellspark</a></em>, Oloitokitok's home planet has a society where women rule and men are regarded as property; the fact that he's managed to obtain an education and a scientific career says a lot about him (and about his wife, whose declaration that she thinks of him as a sister — ie., a fellow human being worthy of being related to as an equal — is in context powerful and moving).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Victoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Victoria">Victoria</a></em>, Azania is a science fiction example. Founded by feminists revolting against patriarchy in a post-apocalyptic world, by the time of the story it has become a high-tech Amazonian nation whose mostly lesbian inhabitants have replaced marriage and motherhood with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomosexualReproduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomosexualReproduction">eugenic cloning</a>. Unfortunately, most of them are also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist">genocidally hostile</a> to all men.
</li><li> In Oleg Makushkin's <em>Crystal Lattice</em>, the Gaian Republic dominates the Eurasian continent in the distant future. Unlike their enemies in the Cyberempire (North America), the Gaians eschew cybernetics (at least in their bodies) and opt for genetic engineering to improve themselves. However, only about 10% of the population are males. Why? It's explained that, for some unknown reason, they haven't yet figured out how to grow genetically-engineered males, only genetically-engineered females. They could grow plain-old males in tubes, but why bother, when men can be born naturally, thus freeing up the tubes for more super-females. Thus, most jobs (including ruling and soldiering) are done by women, and men tend to be relegated to entertainment and low-ranking jobs. Heterosexual relationships are forbidden due to the male deficit, and Gaian women are taught that no woman has a right to exclusively claim a man for herself, as that would go against the common good. Most men are required to regularly attend the so-called Dating Houses, where they get to have sex with any of the women, who go there. The rest are not required to but still go out of a sense of duty. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AManIsAlwaysEager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AManIsAlwaysEager">Not that men mind this setup</a>. Strangely enough, any Cybernetic man captured in battle can choose to stay in the Republic, as long as he agrees to have all the implants removed, but he is then sterilized, which makes absolutely no sense. The Republic is a cashless society, where a person's rank determines her rations and other things like clothing and luxuries. Apparently, it's taken as the axiom that all women want to look great (note: the author is a man), so clothing and accessories are used as incentives to get women to rank up by doing their tasks well. Homosexual relationships are fairly common, although most women are at least bisexual and some are strictly hetero.
</li><li> The Red Abbey of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Maresi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Maresi">Maresi</a></em> is an enforced version of this, as the island has powerful magic that will weaken if men are allowed to stay there long-term. The sisters are quite reasonable about it though: male children are allowed to live with their mothers, and they've rescued male sailors before. Unusually for a work set in medieval times, it's also mentioned to be explicitly trans inclusive, as one of the seven founders was a trans woman.

In other versions however, Theseus ends up marrying either Queen Hippolyta or her sister Antiope. Some Amazons also fought in the Trojan War, and other myths suggest that Alexander the Great had romances with them.

Tarka society is ridiculously structured by human standards with an incredibly complex pecking order and status level, but generally all 'intellectual' parts of said society, like those concerned with science, teaching, higher engineering and politics, are all but barred to Tarka males. This is because of deep-rooted prejudice that males, due to their male sex hormones, are too emotional and irrational to do well in these sectors. Despite this, Tarka females cannot hope to possess the sheer charisma of a Changed male (a male that has reached full sexual maturity; an event that only happens to about 1 in 1000 male Tarka), and thus Changed males are given the overall leadership positions in Tarka society...

Their queen Merla constantly ranted that men were useless. They use a fake distress beacon to lure in travelers so they can enslave the men and force the women to join them, with the help of brainwashing to make them forget their pasts and have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories">Fake Memories</a> of always being in their ranks. It is notable that while the other episodes had the heroes solve the conflict of the planet they land on, they don't here. The only positive change Alan and Alexander accomplish is helping a male slave escape and go into hiding when they make their own escape from enslavement.

The fact that the League saved the inhabitants from Hades didn't save Wonder Woman from being banished for bringing men into their midst. Oddly, the men she was kicked out for bringing in were honored as heroes, as they enforced the rules more out of tradition and fear of the gods than genuine dislike, at least in that instance. Flash even tries to stand up against this, however Batman calms him down and points out it is just as hard or even harder for them to enforce the rule. Eventually, Hippolyta decided "screw it" and allowed Wonder Woman to come back, in order to help close the gates of Tartarus again. Then gave her full access of her powers.

There were some serious rumbles over who was oppressing whom when they banned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">trans</a> women from the festival.
</li><li> Some universities have Women's Centers or women-only safe spaces that permit only female membership. These days, to be more inclusive to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">transgender</a> people, they usually say a woman is anybody who chooses to identify herself as one.
</li><li> The Amazons themselves may have been inspired by the more egalitarian Scythian culture along the north shore of the Black Sea. Many burials of females include armor and weapons.
</li><li> In an aversion of the earlier aforementioned Greeks, the Spartans of all the city-states were the most surprisingly free. Women could divorce at will, and could own property in their own name, among many other things. In fact, they were more or less running Sparta while the men were away fighting (often!). No one Greek city-state was the same as another. Queen Gorgo (wife of Leonidas) responded to a question from a woman in Attica along the lines of why Spartan women were the only women in the world who could rule men, she replied "Because we are the only women who are mothers of men".
</li><li> In an interesting case, the samurai women in Japan, though in a more "traditional" role, were indeed better educated than most other women in East Asia at the time, as one of their chief roles was to teach their children. They were also trained in combat (granted, on more-or-less outdated weapons) and some women were renowned as equal in skill to many male samurai. The training was of course because aside from education, samurai women were to protect the home when the men were away (and provide backup when they were not).
<ul><li> The weapons were more-or-less outdated, but they were also more practical for their role as home defense than what the men used. Women tended to train on naginata, a pole weapon with decent reach and designed to be used in several different positions. They also had knives and, in some cases, short swords. All of these would be relatively easy to wield in more confined spaces in comparison to anything above the length of a katana (samurai kept short swords on them partially for engagements in confined spaces, after all). Think of it as the difference in usefulness of a shotgun and pistol vs. a rifle. The shotgun can be fired easily and quickly and still have a chance of hitting the target at a short range. You have to aim a pistol, but it can be used in close-quarters due to tiny size. A rifle is most useful at longer ranges where aim is crucial and a short-range weapon cannot easily be used.
</li><li> Also accounting has long been a traditionally female activity and largely remains so for domestic purposes. While it is often the husband who earns the household's income, it is he who receives an allowance from his wife, instead of the wife being given a budget for groceries and household items. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1kj3v');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1kj3v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1kj3v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It should noted that Japanese men are often away from their homes either at work or in combat.

</li><li> Hyenas live in matriarchal packs and unusually for mammals, females are larger, stronger, and more aggressive than males.
</li><li> Meerkats and naked mole-rats also live in female-dominated groups, with the mole-rats having a social structure very similar to that of bees or termites: a single dominate queen does all the breeding while the rest of the rats function as non-breeding workers that support the colony.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ARG/Aristasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ARG/Aristasia">Aristasia</a> is a role-playing community/book-series founded on the idea of a world in which there are two genders, both female (one blonde, one brunette), time moves geographically (as in one area of Aristasia is in the 1920s, whereas its neighbors might be in the 1880s), and Femininity itself is one of the fundamental forces of the universe. The creator of the community has a very small retreat for women only that on occasion gets mentioned in the press. Frequently portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand">Lady Land</a>.
</li><li> Nineteenth century New Bedford partially qualifies. As all the men were away <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobyDick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobyDick">killing big adorable sea mammals</a> the wives often ruled much of the city.
<ul><li> Traditional family structures in Jeju, Korea may also qualify, for the exact opposite reason. Women, rather than men, were responsible for the then-menial, low-class job of free diving for conchs, pearls, and abalone. The income from this meant that women essentially became the primary breadwinners on periphery islands where farming was entirely impractical (such as Jeju and Mara...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei">not that Mara</a>), and thus led to a reversal of traditional social roles compared to the mainland.
</li><li> Similarly, in much of Iceland historically most men were off fishing throughout the year, while women held down the fort at home. As many died when out on the rough seas, it became the norm for couples to not marry so the women avoided being widows. The majority of children in such areas were thus born out of wedlock, long before it became widely acceptable in the West.

</li><li> In 1919, Mabel Barltrop (known as Octavia) founded the Panacea Society, composed entirely of women and dedicated to world peace and preparation for the Second Coming. In those days, the Anglican Church did not ordain women. Octavia's church did. Panaceans believed that God was mother as well as father and that while Jesus was God's son, Octavia was God's daughter. Octavia was not only concerned with holy matters, but with maintaining proper etiquette and gracious living. Truly a Lady Land.
</li><li> A generational version has happened in the past after wars. After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, some remote villages lost so many of their marriage-age male population to battle that the very few men returning were a valuable commodity indeed - even if they were missing an arm or a leg. France lost nearly an entire generation of men in World War I, leading to its end as a dominant military power.
<ul><li> Paraguay after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOfTheTripleAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOfTheTripleAlliance">War of the Triple Alliance</a> even more so. The Pope even allowed polygamy for a while, because 90% of the male population (an inverse Decimation if you will) got themselves killed.
</li></ul></li><li> The Na (also called the Mosuo) are a small ethnic group in China that have a semi-matriarchal culture. From the other <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosuo">wiki<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: "They have aspects of a matriarchal culture: women are often the head of the house, inheritance is through the female line, and women make business decisions. However, unlike a true matriarchy, political power tends to be in the hands of males."
</li><li> A large number of Native American tribes are either matrilineal or matriarchal. Some well-known examples include Navajo, Iroquois, and Cherokee. It should be noted that the gender roles in many Native American societies are very differentiated. But in general, the Native American women usually have more power in terms of inheritance, welfare, domestic issues, property ownership, and even selections of chiefs in their clan, while male chiefs' responsibilities are limited to hunting, waging war, and negotiation with tribes.
