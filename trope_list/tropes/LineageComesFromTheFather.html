The implicit assumption is that if a character is going to inherit something of relevance from their bloodline, it's going to be from their father's side, never their mother's. This is applied to both sons and daughters.
</p><p>This is often paired with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleLineOfDescent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleLineOfDescent">Single Line of Descent</a>, creating a long line of fathers and sons. Likewise, the prevalence of this trope is a contributor to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanMomNonHumanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanMomNonHumanDad">Human Mom Non Human Dad</a> having the supernatural partner be the father. Compare the similar trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverASelfMadeWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverASelfMadeWoman">Never a Self-Made Woman</a>, where important female characters ultimately owe their positions or talents to men.

The idea is that it's important to know whose kids are whose, and therefore, it's important that one's wife never have slept with anyone else, usually tied to an even bigger concept that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenActWomenAre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenActWomenAre">Men Act, Women Are</a>.

Lineage Comes From The Father is concerned with the less traditional "inheritance"—for example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood">villainy</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretLegacy">heroics</a>, rather than a title or money.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderInverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderInverted">Gender Inverted</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em>. The Guidebook confirms that Acier was a Silva by birth, and she was the Captain of the Silver Eagles and a Magic Knight famed for her beauty and strength. Noelle is the spitting image of her mother and strives to become a powerful mage like her. Her father, on the other hand, is never mentioned nor seen aside from a very brief flashback which doesn't even show his face.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> initially plays this straight with the main protagonist, Ichigo Kurosaki, whose spiritual awareness and successful transition into a Shinigami are attributed to the powers he inherited from his Shinigami father, Isshin, while his mother was a normal human whose sole importance is to perform <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to protect her son. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then we learn in the final arc that Masaki was actually a powerful Quincy. All this time, whenever Ichigo tapped his "Shinigami" power, it's actually Quincy power. Ichigo has never used his Shinigami power, because he always unwittingly suppressed it; the "Hollow Ichigo" <em>is</em> Zangetsu, while the long-haired "Zangetsu" is his Quincy heritage manifesting in the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Yhwach</a>.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>: Emperor Charles Zi Britannia has fathered hundreds of children, from multiple wives. Every kid is at least a half brother or half sister to each other since they all have only one father, and a bunch of them are line to take over as the ruler of Britannia. Most of them are backups, in case something happens to the first three or so "sets" of sons and daughters. Even Lelouch is nowhere near in position to inherit the throne (17th in line at the beginning). Subverted by the protagonist himself and his sister though since they mostly take after their mother and choose to use her maiden name as their surname instead of making an alias after leaving the royal family. At least one of Lelouch's allies goes out of their way to emphasize that they are only helping him <em>because</em> of who his mother was. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Even the reason that he and Nunnally are actually his father's favorite children comes from her, as their mother is the only woman Charles has ever loved.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>: Averted with Negi. The work focuses initially on his father, the Thousand Master, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">who he takes after and looks almost identical to</a> comes up before then. Ultimately his character is much more similar to his mother, and his lineage from her is more important to the plot (although his lineage from his father is more important to <em>him</em>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>: Subverted. It becomes really clear, really early on that Naruto's father is the village hero, the Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze. However, it turns out that the one whom Naruto really got all the important stuff from was his <em>mother</em>, Kushina Uzumaki, and Naruto being her child is emphasized far more by the characters and the story itself. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The focus on the importance of a mother's legacy becomes even more prevalent with the Sage of the Six Paths and his brother Hamura, who also gained their power from their mother, Princess Kaguya, the strongest person to have every lived. <em>Unlike</em> Kushina Uzumaki, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMatriarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMatriarch">she isn't the type of mother you would be proud of</a>.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderInverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderInverted">Gender Inverted</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>, where almost all the planetary kingdoms across the universe are implied to be matriarchal (all of them are shown being ruled by princesses and queens with the exception of Earth) and the power of the Moon Kingdom is explicitly passed down mother to daughter. Princess Serenity inherited her royal title from her mother (her father is never referred to in any way, not even indirectly, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrulySingleParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrulySingleParent">may in fact be completely nonexistent</a>) and also received her powers as Sailor Moon after her mother reincarnated her. The same holds true for Chibiusa — her mother, Neo-Queen Serenity, is clearly the one in charge of Crystal Tokyo and is who Chibiusa inherits her title of princess and eventual senshi powers from.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Inuyasha's</a> supernatural powers and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">youkai</a> inheritance comes from his father. Even his compassion for humans is stated to be from, thus making him like, his father (later reinforced by his full-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">youkai</a> brother's growing compassion also being stated as coming from, and making him like, their father). In fact, there are three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">half-breeds</a> shown in this story and <em>all three of them</em> have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanMomNonhumanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanMomNonhumanDad">Human Mom, Non-Human Dad</a>, gain all their abilities from their father's side and had a father whose compassion towards humans essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">overshadows</a> any contribution any of the mothers could have made even on this front.
<ul><li> Though subverted with Izumo/Gyo-Oh, a half-demon whose father was human and his mother was a bull demon. He inherited his philosopher-like intellect (and the name Izumo for his human form) from his father's side, and his monstrous evil tendencies from his mother.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em> with Syaoran, whose claim as Clow Reed's successor is through his descent from the family of Clow Reed's mother, the Li clan.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir">Noir</a></em>. While Mireille Bouquet's life was undoubtedly affected by her father Laurent and his ties to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">The Mafia</a>, her mother Odette arguably winds up having the biggest impact on the story because of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the promise she extracted from her own killer, who was none other than Mireille's future partner Kirika, to take care of Mireille</span>.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>: while Goku gets his looks and his fighting genes from his father Bardock, it is from his mother Gine (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">introduced in a supplementary manga released long after the end of the series</a>) that he gets his kind and gentle nature.
</li><li> With Saya and Diva from the anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodPlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodPlus">Blood+</a></em> it is inverted. They are true Chiropterans and thus queens of their kind, and their mother was also a Chiropteran.
<ul><li> And later <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the two daughters born when Diva rapes Saya's brother Riku are also true Chiropterans like Diva</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> A lot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>. For one, the series' signature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessMagnet">Stands</a> are passed down from parents to offspring. Which results in Part 4 into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Invisible Baby</a>.
<ul><li> The Ripple also gets passed down from generation to generation, as evidenced by Joseph, from part 2, being able to use the ripple (to a small extant) without having trained in it before.
</li><li> Main Characters Josuke Higashikata, Giorno Giovanna and Jolyne Cujoh are all offspring of Joseph, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> DIO</span>, and Jotaro respectively, and have the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kiai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kiai">Kiai</a> as their fathers.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>:
<ul><li> Subverted with Nanoha. Her status as a fighter clearly comes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassFamily">her father's side of the family</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumbleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumbleHero">what actually defines her as a person</a> comes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetBaker">her mother</a>.
</li><li> Inverted with Ginga and Subaru.

Looking at the prequels and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a></em>, it becomes clear that in terms of personality, he's more like his mother—he has that same apparently unfounded belief in the goodness of Vader, and (though he <em>can</em> certainly get dangerous when there's call for that) he tries diplomacy first. He handles things his own way, and that's almost never Anakin's way; late-set books actually voice the opinion that he's become passive and reactionary instead of proactive. How much of this can be attributed to genetics versus his upbringing is debatable, but he's more like his mother than he initially seems. Leia, on the other hand, takes after Anakin, though she isn't happy about it. She is way more proactive and stubborn than her brother, and she isn't <em>nearly</em> as forgiving of Vader's sins. The Noghri call her "Lady Vader" for a good reason. However, as of the Sequel Trilogy, this trope seems to be fully averted, as a focus of the trilogy is on Kylo Ren's fixation on claiming the Skywalker legacy for himself, deriving from the fact that he is Leia's son, and not once is his status as a true Skywalker heir questioned on the grounds that it comes from his mother.

They'd like to track down descendants of a certain noble House, but the official records only concern themselves with the patrilineal line  and because that line came to an end, the House is considered extinct. In fact, if you count descent from women of the House in question who married into other Houses, descendants are still quite present  just under other names.
</li><li> Averted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikhailAkhmanov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikhailAkhmanov">Mikhail Akhmanov</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArrivalsFromTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArrivalsFromTheDark">Arrivals from the Dark</a></em> with the so-called "Corcoran line". Paul Richard Corcoran is born at the end of the first book as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Half-Human Hybrid</a> (his human mother was implanted with the seed of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAlien">Faata</a> male in order to test compatibility). He is named after his mother's dead boyfriend Richard Corcoran (officially, he is Richard's son) and his godfather Pavel Litvin. The sequel reveals that Paul never had any sons, immediately subverting this trope. His two daughters ended up continuing his line as well as passing the Faata genes to his descendants. A later novel <em>appears</em> to follow this trope with the protagonist of a novel (Marc Valdez) being the son of Sergey Valdez, the protagonist of the previous novel. However, while the next novel once against follows Marc, the one after that follows a descendant of his sister instead (Marc only has one child, a daughter), while his sister has three of her own (from two different men) plus three adopted. The <em>Trevelyan's Mission</em> spin-off series follows a character who is eventually revealed to be also descended from Marc's sister (about 500 years removed). By that point, a significant percentage of humans are Corcoran's descendants, but the Faata genes have become so diluted that hardly anyone exhibits their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> or longevity.

This is due to the discovery that telepathy is passed on only through mitochondrial DNA. The notable lineage in the books is the Alexander line, of which only women are shown. This, however, begs the question of why it is important for the father to be a strong telepath if his genes for the ability aren't passed on to the offspring.

<ul><li> Played with with Jesus' lineage. Jewish society played this trope straight, so how could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> have Jesus be both biological descendant and legal heir of King David when he has no biological human father? A popular interpretation is that the genealogy presented in Luke is actually through Mary (with the different fathers listed for Joseph being justified as Heli being his father-in-law), meaning both Joseph and Mary can claim to be descendants of the royal line of Judah, making Jesus both a biological descendant of the royal line via Mary and its legal heir via his adoptive father Joseph, who is a direct male descendant of the royal line.
</li><li> In the Torah, a lot of lineages are (in painful detail and length) detailed—but usually only on the male line. Sometimes the mothers along the way are also mentioned, but they're never recursed onto like the men. Interestingly, despite <em>naming</em> lineages by the men, one's "Jewishness" was passed through the <em>mother</em>. Hence a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShiksaGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShiksaGoddess">Shiksa Goddess</a> is considered to be a more serious temptation than a non-Jewish man: if a woman marries outside the faith, her children are still Jewish by birth, but if a man does it, the children are not.

There are lots of demigod with gods for fathers and mortal women for mothers; there are also plenty of demigods with goddess mothers and mortal fathers.
<ul><li> First played straight, then subverted with Frank Zhang: while his father is a god, his mom had powers of her own (and could count several heroes and demigods among her ancestors), and Frank has definitely inherited some things from her side of the family. Such as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the power to transform into animals</span>.

It is also implied that only women of that line can have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a>.

<ul><li> Played straight in Westerosi inheritance law, under which all legitimate male offspring must be dead before titles and property may be passed on to a daughter, and then only as caretaker for the rights of the male heirs she is assumed to be eager to pop out if she hasn't already. (If she is found to be infertile or dies before giving birth to a son, everyone starts looking around for the nearest male cousin.)
</li><li> Averted in Dorne, where gender isn't important. The eldest child inherits, period, regardless of whether or not they are male or female. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They took control of the female "heir" to the Baratheon line, and in their eyes, she became heir after her elder brother died. The rest of Westeros considers her younger brother to be ahead of her, but given there's already a civil war going on that's not a big roadblock.</span>
</li><li> This whole concept is interestingly subverted with bastard children who have one high-born parent, usually the father. In many cases, the father is noble while the mother is a commoner. In such situations, the child is a noble-born bastard child but not able to inherit their father's lands/titles/name/etc, even though they are their father's blood and the father's blood is the more important factor. While it's definitely true that men are often more "important" lineage-wise in <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, it's interesting that simply having a noble father is not enough to make one noble—the father has to publicly acknowledge the child for them to be a noble-born bastard child. Acknowledged, noble-born bastard children are given the regional surnames based on the land their noble father is from to indicate they are of noble blood, while the bastard children of commoner fathers are given no names at all.
</li></ul></li><li> Tristan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Stardust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Stardust">Stardust</a></em> inverts several of these tropes. He gets his royal and supernatural parentage from his mother, and is raised by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle">muggle</a> father, thinking that his stepmother is his biological mother. The fact that his sister is six months younger than him should have been a clue.
</li><li> Played with in the novellette <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/FeliciaSorceressOfKatara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/FeliciaSorceressOfKatara">"The Tailcutter's Curse"</a>: Felicia is initially dismissive of the curse because she knows that the Tailcutter's bloodline ended centuries ago and that the supposedly cursed lord cannot be a true descendant. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out they only recorded the <em>male</em> line of descent and the lord's wife is a descendant whom the curse still applies to.</span>

Familial traits are often followed through the male line, but that is partly a side-effect of following a patriarchal dynasty over generations, but characters are nonetheless described as having traits inherited or instilled by their mothers. Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanMomNonhumanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanMomNonhumanDad">Human Mom, Non-Human Dad</a> is inverted in <em>all</em> cases of mixed-race couples, although that's a side effect of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardHeroReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardHeroReward">different</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngagementChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngagementChallenge">gender</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">archetype</a>.
<ul><li> It is notable that there are no half-elves with a male elf/female human pairing in their ancestry, quite different from the usual Nephilim-type race where the supernatural parent is inevitably male.
</li><li> Also averted with the royal house of Númenor; Elendil, who led the Faithful and founded the realms in exile, was descended from the eldest child of one of the kings, who happened to be a daughter (Silmariën), and the succession law at the time instead favoured her younger brother. <em>His</em> descendants went on to oversee Númenor's fall to evil and destruction, while Elendil's line better represented the spirit of the original kings.
</li><li> It's overall averted with the Noldorin Elves in Middle-Earth, as all the direct-male heirs of both Fingolfin (King of Noldor in Middle-Earth) and Finarfin (King of Noldor in Aman) have been killed by the end of the Second Age, many without ever having had children. Fingolfin is succeeded by Elrond (grandson of his granddaughter Idril) and Finarfin by his daughter, Galadriel. Neither press their claim for King of the Noldor in Middle-Earth.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em> as well. Thorin Oakenshield, who is a direct descendant of Durin the Deathless and the rightful King Under the Mountain, never marries and has no children of his own lineage. However, he does have a younger sister, Dís. <em>She</em> has two sons, Fíli and Kíli. As Thorin's nephews and closest living relatives, Fíli and Kíli are deemed his official heirs. Considering the gender imbalance of dwarves (only one-third of them are female) and how few of them are known to marry or reproduce, it's not surprising that many would have to look to female or distant relatives for blood-related heirs.

It's also not a guarantee that a Grimm's children will all become Grimms. It's also unclear how the Royals determine their line of succession, since we're never shown any female heirs. The King Frederick appears to have only had two children, both male: Eric (legitimate) and Sean (illegitimate). The family appears to be quite large, but only two cousins were shown, also male: Viktor and Kenneth. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Viktor eventually inherits the title after the deaths of Eric, Kenneth, and Frederick, even though he himself is sterile.

This is even a plot point by the end of Season 6 when the Northern lords are willing to overlook his illegitimacy and name him as the King in the North because Jon is the last surviving son of Ned Stark (as far most people know), the living embodiment of a Northern warrior, and the one who can lead them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">in the true war to come</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, it's revealed that he is the biological <em>nephew</em> of Ned Stark, since we learn he is the son of Ned's sister Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, and Jon's Stark lineage comes from his <em>mother</em>.</span>

</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMunsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMunsters">The Munsters</a></em>, Eddie has all the characteristics from his mother's side of the family including lychantropy and some vampiric behaviors, not having anything (as far as we can see) from his father.

The young half-elf Will is the son of a male elf and a human female. When he experienced his adventures, he hears again and again that his father was a powerful wizard and a great hero who has achieved much good. Constantly he is prompted as to be a hero, as his father was one. From his mother you do not hear much after the first episode. You do not even learn her name. Later in the story, there is also another half-elf, a young girl who also had an elf as father and a human as mother.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>, you'd hardly guess simply from looking at him (or speaking to him) that Spock's mother was human; he seems all-Vulcan in most aspects, clearly getting almost everything from his father's side.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> it first looks as if this trope is played straight. Dean and Sam Winchester are two hunters of the supernatural, presumably because their father their father raised them that way. But later it turns out that it is actually a subverted trope. In actuality, their mother's side of the family produced generations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonSlaying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonSlaying">Hunters</a>, while there father's side, with the exception of John, Sam, and Dean, themselves, produced scholars of the supernatural world, who called themselves "Men of Letters". Hunters and Men of Letters worked together to control the things that go bump in the night, making Sam and Dean the perfect amalgamation of the two.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TinMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TinMan">Tin Man</a></em> follows the Oz books in inverting the trope, at least in regard to the royal family.

However, his gentle personality, sense of humanity, and all his other positive traits come from his childhood friend (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">surrogate mama</a>) Siskier.

</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Fable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Fable">Fable</a></em>, where the Hero of Oakvale's mother is his claim to power. The hero of Bowerstone never knew his/her parents, and the hero of Brightwall is the former's child. If the hero of Bowerstone is a woman, there is no hero in the series stated to have inherited their powers from their father. Also of note is sister Hannah, whose father most certainly is not a hero.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>. The asari are a monogendered race, and though they can (and often do) reproduce with other species, the resulting child is always asari. However, many asari are also judged based on their father's species, with the lowest tier being those who were fathered by other asari. The game goes back and forth in general: Ashley Williams joined the military in part because of her grandfather's legacy though she also mentions a great-grandmother who was in the military; Commander Shepard, if the Spacer background is chosen, speaks with his/her mother, who is also a military officer; Miranda Lawson <em>has</em> no mother, being a genetically modified clone of her father with a few bits thrown in; and many krogan proudly claim descent from Shiagur, a female krogan warlord.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Farmville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Farmville">Farmville</a></em>, patterns on sheep and pigs are passed from father to offspring.

For the purposes of continuing the game by bloodline, it's pure male-line. In vanilla, women cannot inherit but under Semisalic inheritance laws, the son of a king's first daughter will inherit over son of a younger son. The sequel takes some measures to avert this, introducing succession laws that allow females to inherit titles under specific circumstances as well as matrilineal marriages, in which the children are considered part of the mother's dynasty rather than the father's.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ImperiumNova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ImperiumNova">Imperium Nova</a></em> players have the choice between making their house patrilineal or matrilineal at creation, this influences which dynastic characters can inherit house leadership and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriages</a>.

She also bears Bastila's last name. Then again, we never learn Revan's (if he even had one). Besides, Bastila raised their son Vaner (note the anagram name) alone, as Revan had to leave for the Unknown Regions and never came back. Satele's secret son Theron also bears her last name, but that's partly due to his father Colonel Jace Malcom not knowing of his existence until later.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em>, played with a few different ways:
<ul><li> Dwarves play this straight 50% of the time, with the recognized lineage and caste of a child being determined by that of their same-sex parent. This means that you could have opposite sex full siblings of completely different castes.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">novels</a> this is inverted by (eventual) King Maric, whose mother Queen Moira Theirin was an unparalleled badass both on the field and behind the scenes. Maric's biggest struggle is living up to her legacy. Maric's father by comparison gets very little focus and was mostly important because he was related to the Teyrn of Gwaren. Moira was also Queen Regnant in relation to her husband, the Prince Consort. Played straight by Maric's own offspring, though.
</li><li> The City Elf is said to take more after their willful mother than their father.
</li><li> Inverted and... uh... played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>? Considering Hawke's father sort of created his own legacy (and we don't even know his past too well before he ever met Leandra, but it's implied to be not very pleasant) by aiding the Wardens, that's the straight part. The inversion would stem from Leandra's side of the family, the Amell lineage, which is noble.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em>, this is the reason which Grand Duke Gaspard blames for the fact that his cousin Celene, the youngest of Emperor Judicael I's six grandchildren, was able to take the throne of Orlais. Judicael's three eldest grandchildren died in their youth, and Gaspard (the only surviving grandson) was raised with the expectation that he would one day be Emperor; however, his royal parent is his mother, Princess Melisande. Celene, on the other hand, is Judicael's granddaughter through her father, Prince Reynaud. There were other factors involved in Celene taking the throne, but this trope was likely a contributor.
</li><li> Inverted in the case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus">Andraste's</a> theorized descendants. Andraste had two daughters, and the younger one had many daughters herself, who then married into various Tevinter families, which use patrilineal naming traditions. Unfortunately, the records of these and subsequent marriages were lost in the second Blight. The Chantry believes that Andraste's bloodline is only capable of producing daughters, so a man, or anyone claiming to be descended from Andraste through their father's side, is automatically disqualified.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfXillia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfXillia">Tales of Xillia</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jude's father is an Elympion, but he keeps the spirit channeling ability of his Rieze Maxian mother. This is probably for the best, since otherwise he may have had a very rough, very confusing time on his own planet.</span>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> series features three (thus far) games with parent-child mechanics, all of them fairly similar despite the radically different approaches to all of them. It plays with this trope in various ways:
<ul><li> This is averted for both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar">Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em>, as the majority of the second generation characters are tied to their mothers.
<ul><li> For <em>Genealogy</em>, mothers have two children each, all with fixed classes, and their skill sets, weapons and Holy Blood can change depending on who their father is. Because of the fixed classes and limited amount of first gen units with holy blood, the second generation can either be a small army of horrendously broken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game Breakers</a> or incredibly weak. The exceptions to this rule are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">Seliph</a> (son of first-gen Lord Sigurd and Dierdre), siblings Altenna and Leif (the children of Cuan and Ethlyn), Julia (daughter of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">half-siblings Arvis and Dierdre</span>), and Ares (son of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OptionalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OptionalBoss">Optional Boss</a> Eldigan and his NPC wife Grahnye), as they are the product of fixed pairings, although Julia's abilities are drawn from her mother. The Sniper Faval is a prominent example, as he inherits his major Ulir blood, and the holy bow Yewfelle, from his mother Briggid.
</li><li> <em>Awakening</em> has said kids tied to mothers again. Both parents lend one reclassing option each and one skill each, with the father lending their hair color to the kids this time. The exceptions are Lucina (daughter of Chrom) and a female Morgan (daughter of a male Avatar). Due to the inflated stat caps, customizable growths, and the potential to pass down gender-exclusive skills to the children, the second generation in this game is arguably an even <em>bigger</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> than <em>Genealogy</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em> plays this straight: while the mechanics for children are the same as <em>Awakening</em> for the most part, the children are all tied to their fathers this time, with the exceptions being a male Kana (son of a female Avatar) and Shigure (son of Azura). While unique class combinations can be passed down (namely the Avatar's Nohr Prince/Princess class and its promotions), this game's second generation is more on par with the first due to a lack of gender-exclusive skills and the children actually having their own growths that are only subtly influenced by whatever mother is chosen for each kid.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Mothers don't appear <em>at all</em> (and are barely mentioned) in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxter">Jak and Daxter</a></em> games, and as such this trope is in full effect. Ashelin is Baron Praxis' daughter, and takes over as ruler of Haven City when he dies, while Jak is descended from the ancient hero Mar through his father, who also happens to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the great warrior Damas, former ruler of Haven</span>.
<ul><li> Rayn is the daughter of the crime boss Krew, and stands to take over his criminal empire... which she only just learned was a thing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Except not really. She was in on his plot to eliminate their rival crime family the whole time</span>.
</li><li> Even minor characters Ximon and Mizo have this to an extent: Ximon works for his father in the pest control business (which has been in the family since his great-grandfather founded it), and Mizo got into racing because of his father's obsession with it.
</li></ul></li><li> Zigzagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Boktai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Boktai">Boktai</a></em> with Django. At first he's presented as nothing more than a complete chip off the old block like his father Ringo. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">You find out later his mother was Mani, a member of <em>the immortals</em>, and that he inherited numerous passive traits from her such as his resistance to Klorofolun (which should turn any living thing it touches undead, but merely harms him) and his ability to become a half-vampire when bitten by his now-vampiric father.</span>
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry4">Far Cry 4</a></em>, since while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">The Golden Path</a> repeatedly emphasizes that protagonist Ajay is the son of their deceased leader Mohan Ghale and refer to him as such, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">Pagan Min</a> clearly cares more about the fact that Ajay is his mother Ishwari's son and seemingly doesn't care at all about Mohan being his father despite the fact that the two men were enemies. At the end of the game it's revealed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pagan has actually named Ajay his heir since Ishwari was the closest thing he had to a queen, and Min's own daughter with Ishwari, Lakshmana, was murdered as a baby by Mohan</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2">XCOM 2</a></em> Chief Engineer Lily Shen owes a good chunk of her characterisation and motives to being the daughter of Raymond Shen, the Chief Engineer in the previous game. Her mother isn't mentioned at all. In the "Shen's Last Gift" DLC, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the AI Julian looks down on Lily for having a mother at all, and considers itself the "undiluted" son of its designer, Raymond Shen. In that case, however, it's played more as evidence of insanity and meglomania.</span>
</li><li> Averted, subverted/inverted, or played straight, depending on the character, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>:
<ul><li> Averted with Cloud Strife, who seems to have been raised by a single mother growing up; we never so much as see his father nor hear his name when Cloud's going through his flashbacks to childhood, and he's so unimportant to the story or Cloud's character development that we don't even know who he is or even if he was necessarily married to Ms. Strife - that could well be her maiden name for all we know.
</li><li> Inverted to the point to subversion with Aerith Gainsborough; it's revealed through the course of the story that though her biological father was a normal human, her birth mother, Ifalna, was a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAncients" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAncients">Cetra</a>...yet it's <em>Aerith</em>, not Ifalna, who is considered the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind">Last Of the Cetra</a>. She even inherited some of her mother's Cetra abilities, such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISeeDeadPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISeeDeadPeople">ability to communicate with people in the Lifestream</a>. Her father isn't completely irrelevant to the story, but his role in Aerith's life or abilities is pretty minute; heck, he didn't even wind up lending her his <em>last name</em>, thanks to her adoption by Elmyra Gainsborough.
</li><li> Subverted, in a strangely zig-zag fashion, with Sephiroth; Hojo claims him as his son, but it's not necessarily clear that Sephiroth realizes he was (and there's even a bit of debate in the fandom as to whether this is referring to biological paternity or Hojo simply claiming Sephiroth as His Greatest Creation). Sephiroth speculates somewhat on his paternity during a flashback segment, but fixates primarily on his absent mother figure...which turns out to be disastrous, as having been told by someone at some point that his mother's name is "Jenova" leads him to claim the alien Calamity From the Skies as his "Mother", in the process <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown">destroying Nibelheim</a> and setting him on the path to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">try and destroy the rest of the world a few years later</a>. In fact, Jenova may not be his birth mother (that would be a human scientist named Lucretia Crescent), but she <em>did</em> contribute some DNA via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Hojo's Jenova Project</a>, which is indicated as being responsible for a lot of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">enhancements</a>. Sephiroth would definitely consider Mother, by which he means Jenova, to be his most important parent/lineage, and given Hojo's obsession with Jenova the world's maddest scientist might not disagree.
</li><li> Played somewhat straight with Tifa Lockhart who is basically depicted as "the Mayor's daughter" in Nibelheim. Her mother <em>is</em> mentioned, but only in reference to her death and Tifa's reaction to it.
</li><li> Played straight with Vincent Valentine. We have no idea who his mother even was, but we have a name, character design and even a profession (former member of the Science Department) for Grimoire Valentine...who looks a hell of a lot like Vincent and even shares his Gothy fashion sense.
</li><li> Played <em>extremely</em> straight with the Shinra family. President Shinra's son, Rufus, inherits his father's world-spanning megacorp upon his father's death...his mother? We don't even know her name, let alone what she looks or looked like.
<ul><li> The prequel game <em>Crisis Core</em> arguably continues this trend with the Shinras, with an illegitimate son of President Shinra plotting against him basically for the crime of pretending he doesn't exist. In other words, his most important goal is getting revenge on his biological father for cutting him out of the formally-recognized Shinra family tree. In the English translation of the game, he even adopted a last name referencing the Shinra name, albeit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus">very subtly</a>.

<ul><li> An aversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius">Girl Genius</a></em>, as Tarvek claims to be the Storm King's heir from his mother.

<ul><li> There's Agatha herself, the last living descendant (so far as we know, anyway) of a powerful family of Sparks. Her family's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci">castle</a> wants her to set about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantGrandkids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantGrandkids">producing some heirs</a>, so we know that the line can proceed matrilineally.
</li></ul></li><li> The drow of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Drowtales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Drowtales">Drowtales</a></em> are a complete inversion as Drow society is both matriarchal and matrilineal, and while some fathers do still live with the children, including Zala'ess' mate Sabbror, it seems that most noble kids have no contact with their fathers, and it's more common for fathers to live with the family in lower-class families. Noble titles especially are exclusively passed through the mother, as are inheritance. There is one known exception: the Tions Sarghress line is carried from Rosof (a male) through his son Ein, to his granddaughter Nei'kalsa. That's two generations where the male line is actually important, but this is a special case and it's likely that the Tions line will now be carried on by Nei'kalsa and her daughters. It's likewise implied that the Illhar'dro clan still <em>officially</em> only cares about the mother's line, but that they'll teach children who their fathers are for political purposes, since that's how the Illhar'dro do business.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/IrregularElis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/IrregularElis">Irregular Elis</a></em> both parents are specials, but the powers of their sons come from Luk, the father.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>: In general, Avatar and its successor <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em> do a lot to subvert this trope, with characters taking a lot of traits from both parents. An Inversion would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief">Chief</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar">Lin Beifong</a>, who takes <em>very</em> strongly after her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassAdorable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassAdorable">mother</a> (and we don't even know who her father was).
<ul><li> The Beifong family in general. Book Three reveals that Toph's younger daughter, Lin's half-sister Suyin, would go on to found an <em>entire city</em>, on the foundation of metalbending. To top it off, it's outright stated that it is THE most prosperous city in the Earth Kingdom, serving as beacon of progression to most of the world. All of Su's children are successful in their own rights, including her daughter Opal, a nonbender who gained airbending as a result of Harmonic Convergence. And just like Lin, Su doesn't know her father either, all but stating that the two are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard">Heroic Bastards</a>.
</li><li> In the original series, Zuko is a titch obsessed with living up to his role as 'Prince of the Fire Nation', and his place in the grand lineage of Firelords. In the episode "The Avatar and the Firelord", he's confused that the story he's told about the titular pair of friends-become-rivals doesn't reveal the promised secrets about his great-grandfather, until Iroh <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather">reveals</a> that the great-grandfather in question was not Firelord Sozin, but <em>Avatar Roku</em>, on his mother's side.
</li><li> By the time of <em>Legend of Korra</em>, Zuko's own daughter, Firelord Izumi (who's probably an only child), has inherited the throne from him. Her son, the crown prince Iroh II , shows up a handful of times throughout LOK so he will inevitably subvert this trope. Izumi was confirmed to have a daughter as well via supplemental material but she's never once seen or mentioned in the series itself. It's not explicitly clear but Izumi's daughter is probably just younger than her son and wasn't passed over for being next in line for being a girl.
</li><li> Aang and Katara's children play with this. Bumi is a nonbender (only becoming an airbender later on), but Kya is a waterbender like her mother and Tenzin is an airbender like his father. Tenzin also has a personally much closer to his mother, being overly serious and quick to anger.

<ul><li> Surnames are usually inherited patrilineally (at least in Western countries). That fact, plus the prevalence of this trope and its relatives, may be why so many things about ancestry are counterintuitive  people think in terms of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleLineOfDescent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleLineOfDescent">Single Line of Descent</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NomDeMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NomDeMom">Nom de Mom</a> is pretty rare as a result. Following that, in European heraldry the right to use a particular coat of arms is passed from father to son. A woman can use the same coat of arms as her father, but her children can't (instead, they'll inherit the right to use their father's coat of arms). Subverted, however, with the creation of some mechanisms to come up with a new coat of arms based on the father's and the mother's ones (quartering, partitioning and dimidiating are the most common methods).
</li><li> Enforced even more strongly in China than in the West. The Chinese patrilineal system is ancient and rigid, and Chinese surnames are strictly passed in the male line. So strong is this influence that Chinese women do not take their husbands' surnames on marriage, as that would disrespect their fathers. Also, Chinese genealogical records are very detailed in the male line because the Chinese incest taboo is stronger for relatives sharing patrilineal descent (that is, sharing male ancestors in the male line) than other variants, but not so much for the female line. The male-line descendants of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Confucius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Confucius">Confucius</a> are still known through this record-keeping (if you trust the records, but there's not as much reason to doubt them as you might think, since genetic testing has shown this to be plausible), but descent in the female line is much harder to find.
</li><li> According to Balkan traditions, a child had the same ethnicity as the father, and the mother's was irrelevant. So, a son born to a Croat man and Serb woman would be a Croat. This meant that while all three major ethnic groups (Croats, Bosniaks, and Serbs) were all trying to wipe each other out during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheYugoslavWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheYugoslavWars">The Yugoslav Wars</a>, they were also setting up 'rape camps' for women of other ethnicities (the Bosnian Serbs were by far the worst perpetrators), where, for example, Serb soldiers would rape Bosniak women, with the intent of producing more 'Serbs,' and to physically and mentally destroy the women. For more information, see <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_the_Bosnian_War">The Other Wiki<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Genetically, these ethnic groups are fairly identical, so the differences were cultural/religious to begin with (they traditionally divide themselves based on religious affiliation).
</li><li> Inverted in Judaism: traditionally, anyone with a Jewish mother is considered Jewish from birth. People with a Jewish father but Gentile mother, however, are Gentiles unless they convert. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averted</a> in denominations like Reform/Liberal Judaism, however, which allow anyone with Jewish descent to join.
<ul><li> Historically tribal status has passed patrilineally, however; today this is most relevant for Levites and Kohenim. This is backed by <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-chromosomal_Aaron">actual genetic evidence<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Also played straight in that in the lists of descendants listed in the Bible (most noticeably in the Book of Genesis) almost no women are mentioned, and it is a relatively new thing in Judaism to honor the Matriarchs (Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah) as well as the Patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob) in prayers.
</li><li> This trope is also one reason why Jews typically argue that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a> can't be the Messiah: if he was actually born of a virgin, how is he a patrilineal descendant of King David? Christians argue that he inherited this from Mary and/or adoption by Joseph, but Jews don't see this as a legitimate fulfillment of Messianic prophecy.
</li></ul></li><li> Preformationism, a defunct theory of reproductive science, held that one sex provided the child and the other only nurtured/triggered its development. Two rival preformationist schools of thought existed: one where Lineage Comes From The Father because men's sperm were actually miniature babies, and one where Lineage Comes From The Mother because women were born with miniature babies inside their uteri. Presumably, the miniature babies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveReality">included ultra-miniature babies for the next generation</a>.... Modern biology, of course, has shown that the embryo is formed by DNA from <em>both</em> parents, meaning each view <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">was partially correct</a>.
</li><li> Mitochondrial genetic inheritance comes exclusively from females to offspring, whereas the Y chromosome of mammals is passed solely from father to son. This makes it <em>extremely</em> useful for tracking migrations of people over thousands of years: since the only way that the mitochondrial DNA or Y chromosome can change is through mutation, men with the same mutation in the Y chromosome have a common male ancestor in direct paternal line (they share a father's father's father's father's...father), and people with the same mutation in the mitochondrial DNA have a common female ancestor in direct maternal line (they share a mother's mother's mother's...mother). By identifying major mutations, you identify groups of genetically related people, including where and when different groups split off from others. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a>'s articles on <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Y-chromosome_DNA_haplogroup">human Y-chromosome DNA<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mitochondrial_DNA_haplogroup">mitochondrial DNA haplogroups<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. However, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE9WnROTSQs">a recent discovery has revealed that you can inherit mitochondria DNA from both parents<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, effectively making this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">zig-zagged</a>.
</li><li> Inverted for the Ijaws of southern Nigeria, where membership in a War Canoe House (and thus land inheritance) is matrilineal. Only if the groom's family sponsors a (and traditionally expensive and religiously ominous) Second Wedding ceremony can the children claim to belong to their father's House (which is usually their father's mother's House). It was not uncommon in the old days for very rich men to perform Second Wedding ceremonies for women married to other men. The Big Shot gained no sexual rights, but hey, if there was a war, all her sons would fight under his House's banner.
</li><li> Inverted in many West African cultures, which believed that all of a person's blood came from his or her mother.
</li><li> Inverted by the Iroquois, who were matrilineal.
</li><li> Also inverted by the Seminole in a sense. A Seminole person belongs to the clan of his or her mother.
</li><li> Downplayed by the Aztecs. Hereditary leadership was passed on via the mother (who the father was could often be uncertain). Upon a leader's death, the title would pass on to his brother, and then on to his sister's sons.
</li><li> Agnatic primogeniture, sometimes referred to as 'Salic Law' after the Salian Franks who codified it, excludes women from the line of succession and under the stricter interpretations prevents inheritance through a female relative. One example comes from the succession of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfHanover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfHanover">The House of Hanover</a>, which held both the British throne and the throne of the Elector/King of Hanover. In 1837, William IV died with no legitimate descendants of his own. The British throne passed to the next available heir, his niece <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Victoria</a>. But the Hanoverian succession was bound by Salic Law and passed to the senior male heir, William's younger brother Ernest Augustus I.
</li><li> Inverted by the Egyptians, where descent was through the mother due to the potential for uncertainty about the father. However, unless there was no other option, only the sons (or the son of a second wife) would become pharaoh. To be sure, Pharaohs often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">combined the two types of lineage</a>.
</li><li> Patrilineal descent (this trope) is more common in traditional agricultural societies than matrilineal descent (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">the inverse of this trope</a>). Meanwhile, modern industrial societies (as well as hunter-gatherer societies) have a tendency towards bilateral kinship, i.e. they consider mother and father roughly equally important and are more concerned about kinship networks than about lineages. For more information, consult <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship#Descent">The Other Wiki<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> or anthropological research on kinship and descent.
</li><li> The Ottoman dynasty had a rather different system of producing heirs than Christian rulers in Europe, where having a noble mother and being born within wedlock was very important in order to be considered a legitimate succession candidate. The sultans would make celibate marriages with foreign princesses for purely political reasons, and have sex with their concubines in order to actually produce children since they didn't want royal heirs being raised or influenced by a wife who was from foreign nobility. Many of these concubines were of low birth, but it didn't matter because the Ottomans believed that everything important comes from the father, and thus their children were just as eligible to become sultan as one born to the sultan's legal wife would have been. Ideally the sultan would cease relations with a concubine after she produced her first son, the idea being that she would concentrate on taking care of that one son instead of having her attention divided between several. As long as multiple concubines produced sons there would still be plenty of potential heirs. Suleiman the Magnificent precipitated the breakdown of this system by marrying his concubine Hurrem Sultan and having multiple children with her, which is said to have increased the influence that royal mothers had over the court.
</li><li> In Muslim culture, the honorific title <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayyid">Sayyid<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> is applied to men who can trace patrilineal descent from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheProphetMuhammad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheProphetMuhammad">The Prophet Muhammad</a> (well, as patrilineal as possible—his only grandchildren were through his daughter Fatimah).
</li><li> In almost all human traditions throughout history, status and material inheritance is determined by the father (or the husband once a girl is married).
