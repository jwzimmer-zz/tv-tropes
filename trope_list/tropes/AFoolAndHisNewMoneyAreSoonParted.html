</li><li> A totally trustworthy chap convinces them to secure their fortune in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ponzi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ponzi">foolproof investment scheme</a> — whoops, turns out he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMan">Con Man</a>.
</li></ul><p>At that point, the character is sincerely worried about their future and the people they left behind, perhaps for the first time in their life.

An unfortunately common story among real-life lottery winners (to take one example) who suddenly come into a massive windfall is that they are often so unused to having and managing a large amount of wealth and are often so flush with the elation of having a seemingly unimaginably large amount of money that they don't realise how quickly they're able to spend it or the other financial commitments (such as taxes) that come with it. As such, they've often ended up right back where they started or even worse off; sadly, unlike in fiction, many of these tales don't have happy endings.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnOneCondition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnOneCondition">On One Condition</a>: The character gets a large inheritance, but with an impossible-to-keep condition in the will.

<ul><li> Kankichi Ryotsu of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kochikame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kochikame">Kochikame</a></em> had been making his fortunes multiple times throughout the series whether from an inheritance, gambling or selling popular products. He always loses all his wealth from overspending, bad investments or from accidents. He's back to being a patrol officer again.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>'s Water-7 Arc, it's implied that, prior to stealing the Straw Hats' two hundred million, whenever the Franky Family got into some cash they'd lose it either through partying or betting at the races. And what happened to the remaining money? It ended up being spent on the Straw Hats and friends' victory party. Nami is <em>furious</em> to learn this. However, it turns out to be a zig-zagged example as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">while the Franky Family did blow a lot of the money they stole from the Straw Hats into the various parties, betting and such as, Franky made much better use of part of it, in order to buy some legendary Adam wood, the best quality wood in the world, to build the Straw Hats a new ship to replace the lost Going Merry</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Tactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Tactics">Tactics</a></em>, whenever Kantarou and thus, the gang, come into any money, it's guaranteed never to last very long, much to Youko's despair.
</li><li> Faye from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em> has this as a recurring problem. Every time she comes into a good chunk of money (either through swindling or genuine bounty hunting) she'll blow it betting on races and lose it all in an instant. Spike even calls her out on it but she proclaims "It's better than keeping it in the bank."
</li><li> Ryo Saeba and Kaori Makimura from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter">City Hunter</a></em> have this problem, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified">with two good reasons</a>: their continuous fights often damage their home and the Cat's Eye cafe (resulting in them having to pay for the repairs of their home and refunding Umibozu and Miki for the damage at the Cat's Eye), and Ryo tends to go through very expensive ammunition like it is water. Even before those fights started to give cause, Ryo managed to spend <em>one hundred million yen <strong>in one week</strong></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">The inserts in the Complete Edition of the manga explain</a> he gave them all to the rehab center where he had recently sent a group of junkies.</span>
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiUniverse">Tenchi Universe</a></em>, Ryoko is tasked to get food for the gang as they're running low on their trip to Jurai. Ryoko, being a little more amoral than her OVA counterpart, runs off with the money, wins big in races and treats herself to a vacation. When Ryo-Ohki guilt-trips Ryoko into doing the right thing, she's blown the money on the vacation and what's left is converted to almost nothing, forcing her to rob a bank to get the money.
</li><li> An early episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiInTokyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiInTokyo">Tenchi in Tokyo</a></em> had the girls make money on their own so they can use it to visit Tenchi (they had a gateway, but Tenchi got tired of it and blocked it). Sasami ends up being the one who makes the most money. The very next episode, Sasami uses the gateway to escape the girls - they became so desperate, they started hounding her for her money - and Tenchi decides to let her use it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventure">Jojos Bizarre Adventure</a></em>
<ul><li> A variant happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureDiamondIsUnbreakable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureDiamondIsUnbreakable">Diamond Is Unbreakable</a></em>, when Josuke, Okuyasu, and Shigechi win a small fortune on a lottery ticket. Josuke's mom takes his share and puts it in a secure bank account to keep him from pulling this trope, so he ends up not seeing a single yen. (Okuyasu intentionally puts his share in the bank, as he's actually very sensible with money.)
<ul><li> Played straight in an earlier scene, where Joseph Joestar needs to buy baby supplies for the invisible baby they found and borrows Josuke's card with all his saved up money (since he doesn't have his own money on hand). Due to a combination of being rich enough to not really think about money, not understanding the dollar-to-yen exchange rate, the onset of senility and a very pushy salesman, the money is soon gone. However, Josuke gets back at him by stealing his wallet later on.
</li></ul></li><li> The eponymous Stand of the Milagro Man arc in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureJojolion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureJojolion">Jojolion</a></em> is capable of creating and duplicating money, and anyone who does as little as touch it will constantly earn money no matter how much they spend it, or how much they destroy. Oh, don't worry, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">there's no mandatory part where you'll inevitably lose all of it;</a> instead, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByGreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByGreed">you'll be quite literally buried in ever-multiplying money and either get crushed to death or suffocate.</a> The only way to dispel the Milagro Man's curse is to actually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoke</a></em> this trope, either by returning the money to its previous owner or transfer the curse to some poor sap by tricking them into destroying it.

He moves out of his apartment and into an expensive house in a gated community, passes out hundred dollar bills to everyone on campus, hires bodyguards to keep him away from Nikki (they let her pass because she made them pies), buys custom-made clothes and shoes, as well as two very expensive cars plus another one for his new girlfriend Paris. He also makes a lot of other expensive purchases. And this is all BEFORE he received one cent from his uncle's estate. In the end, the estate is hit for back taxes, leaving the Professor with an inheritance of ONLY ten dollars. Of course he's broke and homeless, and Nikki is more than happy to help him out.

The girls get a large sum of money from their friend Sophie as a loan/investment and use it to finally start their cupcake store. They try to be very frugal with the money, don't spend any of it on personal items and even keep working as waitresses in the diner to pay for rent and food. However, they misjudged their market, their location is not ideal and they make a number of costly mistakes like not buying business insurance. Their business is losing money and they are only saved from bankruptcy because a developer offers to buy out their lease. They barely manage to pay off their debts and are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">back in the same place financially as they were at the beginning of the series</a>.

Having watched for two days how the the prince indulges in debauchery at the hotel and frequents shady bars, and pays with checks that bounce, Joe dismisses his one million dollar check of gratitude when all is over, going as far as shredding the check to prove his certainty to his SIU colleagues. Immediately, a call from the bank comes asking in what currency Joe would like to claim his money.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigTimeRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigTimeRush">Big Time Rush</a></em>, the boys complain of not getting more money for their hard work which is being frozen in accounts until they reach 21. So Griffin gives them a challenge of giving each $20,000 and not spending it all within 48 hours. Naturally, the boys flub it from the word "Go". James buys a snake in order to impress a girl which fails, Carlos hires an assistant and loses his money having to pay his fees, Logan throws away his money tipping people left and right and Kendall, who was trying to be responsible and invest it, accidentally buys a truckload of oranges. The boys just <em>barely</em> manage to get their money back through some last-minute contrivances but do learn their lesson by the end of it.
</li><li> This is the central premise of <em>Ballers</em>. Spencer is a former NFL star who tried to be careful with his money but still lost all of it when his crooked manager embezzled it. In the present, Spencer works as a financial manager trying to help other professional football players avoid his mistakes. One of his new clients is almost pathologically unable to not spend his money on frivolous luxuries and maintaining a massive posse of hangers-on. He only starts to listen to Spencer when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookersAndBlow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookersAndBlow">Hookers and Blow</a> situation threatens to derail his career and he realizes how broke he really is.

<ul><li> Big Head is already shown to be a well-meaning guy but also basically a moron. Thus, it's no surprise that when he gets $20 million in a buyout from Hooli, he ends up blowing it fast. After buying a big mansion, he has the pool moved to a different part of the yard then has it moved back when he realizes the new spot can't be hooked up to water lines. It's also revealed he was actually renting most of the furniture and items in his house which means he can't sell them off to pay his debts. True, his manager ends up embezzling a lot but it's obvious Big Head would have run through it fast on his own.
<ul><li> Further compounding matters is that Erlich convinces Big Head to go into business with him just so he can use Big Head's wealth for his own gains. Erlich then spends over a million dollars on a huge party at Alcatraz before discovering Big Head is broke. While Erlich figures out the manager has been stealing Big Head's money, a district attorney refuses to prosecute as she argues that Erlich and Big Head would have ended up blowing all the cash anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> Jian Yang, a Chinese expat who rooms with the main guys in the "Incubator" house, similarly runs into this in Season 5. After creating his own app and getting a pretty penny for it, he ends up squandering it all on gambling and other frivolous expenses, forcing him back at square one.

However, Datak wasn't going to let him get away with knocking out his best enforcer and takes most of the winnings at gunpoint, leaving him only a small amount "for your troubles", which Nolan promptly spends at a brothel.

He returned shortly after. Not only had he spent all (or at least most) of the money, he's now in AA, as the lifestyle he was living was apparently more hedonistic than indulgent.

</li><li> Subverted for laughs on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheResident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheResident">The Resident</a></em>. When Dr. Bell discovers a new patient just won $36 million in the lottery, he immediately starts sucking up to him in hopes of getting a huge donation for the hospital. In the end, the man cuts the check with Bell surprised to see it's only for a few thousand dollars. The man reveals that rather than take the full winnings immediately, he chose to have his fortune given to him in annual installments which are taxed less and eventually add up to more money. He fails to see Bell's forced smile as he openly laughs "Come on, only an idiot thinks it's better to get $36 million right off the bat!"

He falls into debt almost immediately once his income stream dries up, and is shown to have bought a lot of frivolous things over his career, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince">Prince</a>'s guitar. One deleted scene clarifies that he makes forty million dollars a year, but has only about 240,000 in the bank, and he has spent at least some of that money on thirteen houses, a private jet (which he can outrun on foot), a private island he's never visited, and having the ashes of Jan Michael Vincent shot into space.

The course of the episode sees all the cast wasting it in some form or another (Fry buying a hundred cups of coffee, Bender gets supplies to steal a rare cigar, Farnsworth a temporary stem cell procedure, Amy a talking tattoo, Hermes a walking pair of stilts to impress his son, etc.) save for Zoidberg who, for the first time in his life having more money then ever, tries to "live like a rich person". He gets shot down when his refund is revealed to be peanuts to the social elite.

Alas, when he returns home with his winnings, his scolding wife not only disapproves of his gambling addiction, but she promptly confiscates his winnings to use for herself, leaving a crushed Goofy to mutter, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyComeEasyGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyComeEasyGo">Easy come, easy go...</a>"
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em> cartoon "Million Dollar Cat" has Tom inheriting $1 million under the provision that he harm no animals—even a mouse. This gives Jerry the chance to yank Tom's chain throughout the cartoon until the conclusion when Tom's camel complains of a broken back—he rips up the telegram and sets about thrashing Jerry, stopping long enough to say this to us (in Bill Hanna's voice):
<div class="indent"><strong>Tom:</strong> Gee. I'm t'rowin' away a million dollars... <strong><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthIt">BUT I'M HAPPY</a>!!</em></strong> (Continues his onslaught)

He turns the other cheek when other denizens insult him, but when they insult Lydia... well, B.J. may kiss his money goodbye but it's a principle for which he stands up.

<ul><li> One cartoon was a spoof of the 1950s drama <em>The Millionaire,</em> and had Popeye as the mysterious benefactor who gives out $1 million cashiers' checks to Olive, Wimpy, Swee' Pea and even Brutus. He goes out in his sailor suit to see how they had been spending the money (Wimpy buys a cattle farm but can't summon the heart to grind up an innocent cow into hamburger; Swee' Pea buys the mother of all-day suckers; and Olive is getting the mother of all makeovers). Brutus uses his million to buy up and bury all the spinach farms in the world, leaving Popeye with no spinach—except the green wad Brutus shoves in his mouth (we all know what happens next). At the end, Popeye says he's seen what money did to his friends so he gave his last million to the sailor's relief fund.
</li><li> Another had Wimpy as the heir to a fortune. He is to be a referee at a prize fight in which Popeye is a participant. Wimpy bets every dollar he has on the opponent, and during the fight, his butler KOs Popeye out cold. Wimpy is counting Popeye out but, busrting into tears, he doesn't have the heart to double-cross his pal. He gives Popeye some spinach, Popeye knocks out his opponent, and Wimpy says goodbye to his money.

The conclusion is that Greg is content with his life, so they resolve to spend it on a night on the town in nearby Empire City. Steven insists that they take Pearl, Steven's fellow Crystal Gem. Upon arrival, the beached dressed trio buy tailored tuxedos, fine dining, and a penthouse room, and proceed to dance the night away. Amongst their affluent spending, Pearl and Greg resolve a long standing interpersonal conflict.

</div></li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder14');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder14" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> All too common in real life. When poor or even middle-class people win the lottery, gain an inheritance or otherwise come into a large sum of money, there's a good chance that they lose it all and are completely broke in a few years or even a few months. Unlike on TV, there is rarely, if ever, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a>. It's especially common with people who never learned how to handle money, and who are so overwhelmed with the wealth that they feel like they can never spend it all. By the time they learn how wrong they are, they're often worse off than they were to start with.
<ul><li> This sort of thing is so common that they even gave the condition a name: "sudden wealth syndrome". According to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TLC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TLC">TLC</a> show "The Lottery Changed my Life," around one-third of lottery winners go bankrupt within five years.
</li><li> This also happens to children who may get a large (for them, at least) sum of money for something like a birthday, first communion, quinceañera, bar/bat mitzvah, confirmation, graduation, etc. or even if they get a summer job. Their parents may intentionally sit back and let their kid spend all the money, and then pipe in with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> about money management. Zig-zagged in that <strong>a)</strong> The amount of money is pretty trivial compared to other examples of this trope <strong>b)</strong> Some parents step in ahead of time.
</li><li> And <em>God forbid</em> you let other people know about your sudden increase in wealth if you can actually stay anonymous. <a class="urllink" href="http://m.walb.com/walb/db_347747/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=eA5NDXZ6">Lottery winners such as this poor fellow have been murdered in an attempt to steal their earnings<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The murder rate in general of lottery winners is over <em>thirty times higher</em> than the average person. Savvy people will realize that having a sudden influx of wealth generally makes you a big target for the likes of con artists, beggars, phony debt collectors, and even murderers and kidnappers (to try and get ransom money). Ways to get around this include hiring security, moving to a secured location <em>before</em> securing the winnings, and having a trusted law firm claim the earnings for you (which would naturally mean a cut of the earnings going to them, but better than having the full amount and getting killed for it). Some people are desperate and even willing to kill for money. To make matters worse, if you're thinking "Well, I'll just ask the lottery people to not announce that I won", in most US states you <em>can't.</em> All but a handful of states in America <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0zli4');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0zli4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0zli4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Delaware, Kansas, Maryland, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina and Texas as of this writing</span> don't allow you to claim your lottery winnings anonymously.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Carroll_%28lottery_winner%29">Michael Carroll<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the self-proclaimed "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowerClassLout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowerClassLout">king of the chavs</a>", is a notorious example in Britain. A rubbish collector who won £9.7m in a lottery in 2002, he continued to have run-ins with the law (and, being well known for being rich and widely disliked, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveYourWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveYourWife">run-ins with the other side of the law</a>), and spent his winnings as if it grew on trees. By 2010, he had filed for bankruptcy and gone back to his old job, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthIt">but has expressed no regrets about how he spent the lot</a>.
</li><li> In 2000, in France, Jacques and Martine Riez, who had debt issues, won 1.5 million; 15 years later, after much spending, they ended up poorer than before, living in a council house they might be removed from for non-payment of rent.
</li><li> Viv Nicholson was a textbook example in Britain. In 1961 her husband Keith won £152,000 on the football pools (the equivalent of over £3.5 million today) and Viv declared that they were going to "spend spend spend". They did just that and within a few years, it was all gone. Their story was later turned into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BBC">BBC</a> drama written by Jack Rosenthal entitled "Spend, Spend, Spend".
</li></ul></li><li> Professional athletes seem disproportionately susceptible to this trope, more so if the player came from a poor background - see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ESPN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ESPN">ESPN</a>'s <em>30 for 30</em> documentary <em>Broke</em> for details, which opens by quoting a 2009 <em>Sports Illustrated</em> article stating that around 60% of NBA players are broke within five years of leaving the sport and 78% of NFL players are at least in "serious financial trouble" within two years. Usually the culprit is some combination of:
<ul><li> Their unusual annual income structure (they only get paid during the 5-7 months out of the year their sport is in season - during the most recent 2011 NFL lockout stories circulated of players trying to get advances on their paychecks because otherwise they couldn't pay their own bills)
</li><li> Short career length (the average tenure of a pro athlete is only 3.5-6 years - most will be out of work by age 30) and failure to plan beyond it (because most of their income comes so early, their financial strategy needs to be different from other people - they should be planning as though they were 55-year-olds since their income is going to drop within a decade).
</li><li> If they grew up poor, they probably have never had to worry about paying income tax. Thus it can come as a shock that their newfound wealth not only means they now have to pay but puts them in a very high tax bracket where up to 50% of their earnings may be owed.
</li><li> Big money purchases of items of with poor resale value (like cars and jewellery), high running costs (like planes and yachts) or dubious utility (buying a new house is one thing, buying an eight-figure mansion with twenty bathrooms and an eight-car garage is another).
</li><li> Rich young athletes will inevitably attract lots of women, which in turn often leads to hefty divorce settlements and child support payments further down the line.
</li><li> Their own fame becoming a liability (players' contracts are publicly listed so everyone, including unscrupulous agents, con artists and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">gold diggers</a>, knows you're young, naive, and have tons of money. In addition, everyone tends to think that just because you're a pro athlete you make millions like the most famous ones when the majority of players' contracts aren't much higher than the league minimum.)
</li><li> The myriad number of injuries their bodies can accumulate during their career will often mean very large medical expenses later in life.
</li><li> Inability to turn down friends/family with handouts, whether for business opportunities that aren't economically sound or just "C'mon, you can spare an ol' pal a thousand!"
</li><li> The competitive mentality that leads to success on the field leads to a disastrous arms-race with their checkbook: They <em>have</em> to outspend the other guys right now; if a teammate has an expensive watch, they want one even more expensive. If he's got a Ferrari, you need to own <em>two</em>. The drive to make more money often results in favoring high-risk ventures rather than safe investments with limited returns.
</li></ul></li><li> Irish football legend George Best earned a fortune and lost almost all of it through his celebrity lifestyle. When asked what happened to the money he had earned, Best quipped: "I spent a lot of money on booze, birds (women) and fast cars. The rest I just squandered."
</li><li> The documentary <em>Reversal of Fortune</em> involved giving a homeless man $100,000 in cash and seeing what he did with it. It was gone within 6 months, and indeed he wound up in even worse financial shape then he was before.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pirate">Pirates</a> were notorious for spending their fortune after a successful raid on booze and prostitutes in a matter of days. This can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> as their lives were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou">not quite safe</a>. If you have got a lot of money but could die soon, it can be understood that they considered spending it immediately as a better option than risking never being able to use it.
<ul><li> Even if a pirate was in a fiscally-responsible mood there were few things they could do with their plunder aside from blow it all at the nearest port. Few if any banks would deal with a known pirate (though they might deal with privateers) and many pirates operated in parts of the world where there were no banks to begin with. The best they could do with their gold was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuriedTreasure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuriedTreasure">hide it somewhere</a>, and only one pirate (Captain Kidd) was ever confirmed to have done that.
</li></ul></li><li> German actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KlausKinski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KlausKinski">Klaus Kinski</a> typically starred in a successful movie, then spent all his salary on partying with friends, expensive clothing and 5-star hotels (and drugs), resulting in him becoming broke after a short time. After he had to live in a run-down single-room apartment for a few weeks, he often resorted to phoning his old friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WernerHerzog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WernerHerzog">Werner Herzog</a> once again to ask if he had any more film roles available. Rinse and repeat.
</li><li> Heather Mills reportedly burned through her £24.3 million divorce settlement from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a> in less than two years. She claimed to have given the bulk of the money to various charities, but that's still pretty impressive.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges">The Three Stooges</a></em>: Defied <em>hard</em> in real life by Moe Howard. When he saw how Larry and Curly were spending their money (Larry was a gambling addict who almost went bankrupt after Columbia stopped making shorts with the Stooges, and Curly kept spending his money on wine, food, women, homes, cars, and dogs), he took it upon himself to manage their paychecks and their estates so that they wouldn't be penniless in their old age, a fate which <em>did</em> eventually befall many of their contemporaries.
</li><li> Can happen in entire countries suffering from <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse">resourse curse<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: basically, the economy is based on a very valuable product or service crowding out the rest of the economy, and most of the money is used on unproductive ventures, meaning that, when this income is reduced because of a fall in prices or tapping out, the rest of the economic sectors cannot compensate. The economy of Nauru was one of the more infamous cases: they <em>tried</em> to set up funds for when their phosphorous mines inevitably ran out, but proceeded to constantly dip into their trusts. When the mines did run out, Nauru was broke.
</li><li> Pushed by her mother Wanda Rhodes, Wanetta Gibson falsely accused fellow student Brian Banks of rape and won a $750,000 settlement from the school district, which they squandered on cars, game consoles, big screen TVs and other stuff, meaning that they ended up having to flee from house to house as the debt collectors came to repossess everything that wasn't sold off, and this was before Banks was exonerated and they were ordered to pay up $2.6 million to the school and Banks.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarxBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarxBrothers">Chico Marx</a>'s gambling addiction cost him millions of dollars by his own account. When an interviewer in the late 1930s asked him how much money he had lost from gambling, he answered, "Find out how much money Harpo's got. That's how much I've lost." The Marx Brothers made <em>A Night in Casablanca</em> because he'd filed for bankruptcy a few years prior. Because of his out-of-control gambling, the brothers finally took the money as he earned it and put him on an allowance, on which he stayed until his death.
</li><li> Of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees">The Monkees</a>, Micky Dolenz fared the best when it came to royalty payments because he trusted his mother to handle his money, which she invested carefully in "safe" stocks and holdings. As for the others, Peter Tork gave most of his money away, Davy Jones lost most of his in bad investments, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelNesmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelNesmith">Michael Nesmith</a> spent his on family luxuries and artistic projects.
</li><li> Because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who</a>'s early stage act relied on smashing instruments, and owing to Keith Moon's enthusiasm for damaging hotels, the group were in debt for much of the 1960s; John Entwistle estimated they lost about £150,000. Even when the group became relatively financially stable after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tommy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tommy">Tommy</a></em>, Moon continued to rack up debts. He bought a number of cars and gadgets, and flirted with bankruptcy. Moon's recklessness with money reduced his profit from the group's 1975 UK tour to £47.35 (equivalent to £390 in 2018).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MCHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MCHammer">MC Hammer</a> seems to have become a byword for this among rappers, with <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nelly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nelly">Nelly</a> snarking "blow 30 mil like I'm Hammer" in one track. He didn't get fully hit by this until the mid-90s, when his career hit a slump and he could abruptly no longer pay his bills, but he certainly fit the bill of frivolous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuousConsumption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuousConsumption">Conspicuous Consumption</a> and living beyond his considerable means.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelltaleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelltaleGames">Telltale Games</a> is one of the more infamous modern stories in gaming. A relatively small company for most of its life, it put out small episodic adventure games that were often based on licensed properties... until, abruptly, it struck gold with its version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a></em>, which won tons of acclaim and sales and abruptly pushed them into the spotlight. Unfortunately, Telltale's heads thought that the best way to spend all this new money was to try to repeat <em>The Walking Dead</em>'s success—that is to say, spending tons of money buying up lots of licenses to base games on, and then spending more money hiring and training up a vastly larger staff, and then spending even more money trying to make as many <em>TWD</em>-style games as possible. The result was that, far from repeating its success, Telltale found that almost none of its games even made their money back, and when coupled with a market they oversaturated by themselves and employees leaving in droves, they folded in 2018.
