</li><li> The iconic mascot is actually named Smokey Bear, not Smokey <em>the</em> Bear.
</li><li> Until recently, Kinder Eggs have not been available in the US. The common assertion is that Kinder Eggs are banned due to children choking on the toys because they were too stupid to know there was a plastic egg inside. This is practically impossible since Kinder Eggs have been denied import since before they were created. In fact, the only confirmed cases of a child choking on one was in Great Britain and South America. Kinder Eggs were banned because of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 which forbade the inclusion of a non-nutritive element embedded inside the food. Kinder Eggs were not banned; they just didn't meet food standards.
</li><li> It is a commonly held belief that American beers have a lower alcohol content, but they are within the ranges of beers across the world. This belief comes from labeling and advertising. Europe displayed their alcohol content using Alcohol By Volume, but the US used Alcohol By Weight. Since alcohol weighs less, it resulted in a lower percentage displayed. After seeing poor sales, US manufactures switched to ABV as well; but the perception continued.

While there are indeed plenty of deep, philosophical strips, there are also a lot of strips without deeper meanings, such as the one where Calvin pretends to be an onion for the school play.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/DickTracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/DickTracy">Dick Tracy</a></em>: People not familiar with the comic tend to think of Flattop as Tracys <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Archenemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Archenemy">archenemy</a>. In the actual comic, he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">permanently killed off</a> at the end of his only story arc, like many of Tracy's other enemies. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutVillain">he proved extremely popular with fans</a>.

But in truth, there have been numerous occasions — some surprisingly early on in the strip's run — where Charlie comes out on top in the end.
</li><li> Marcie and Peppermint Patty being a couple has been a recurring joke for decades due to Marcie's high respect for Peppermint Patty and Patty's tomboyishness. They've both been shown to have crushes on Charlie, which debunks the concept of them being exclusively lesbian (which is what the idea usually goes with).

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Cupcakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Cupcakes">Cupcakes</a></em>:
<ul><li> The depiction of Pinkie Pie from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> having a violent, stoic alter ego named "Pinkamena Diane Pie" comes from the fanfic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Cupcakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Cupcakes">Cupcakes</a></em>. It was thought to be inspired by her flat-haired, schizoid self from a disturbing scene in "Party of One" where Pinkie has a full conversation about how rude her friends are with various inanimate objects. Not only was the fic released <em>before</em> "Party of One" premiered, but Pinkie is her curly-maned and cheerful self despite torturing ponies to death, this supposed "Pinkamena" alter ego never appearing. A lot of the unease of the fic comes from the fact that Pinkie, as her normal happy-go-lucky hyperactive self, is either unaware or apathetic to the horrors she's committing; a violent alter ego would defeat the whole point. The blog <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Blog/AskPinkaminaDianePie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Blog/AskPinkaminaDianePie">Ask Pinkamina Diane Pie</a></em> probably didn't help.
</li><li> <em>Cupcakes</em> is very frequently cited as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Creepypasta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Creepypasta">creepypasta</a>. It was never intended to be one. It's a fanfic, or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkFic">Dark Fic</a> more specifically.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheRugratsTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheRugratsTheory">The Rugrats Theory</a></em> isn't nearly as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneEqualsViolent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneEqualsViolent">violent</a> or "creepy" as fan-art and derivatives make it seem. It deals with dark themes, such as child loss and drug addiction, but it's mainly about a mentally ill child who has trouble deciphering reality from hallucination. The one violent thing Angelica does is hit Dil, resulting in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodBrainDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodBrainDamage">Childhood Brain Damage</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolander</a> personality in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllGrownUp">All Grown Up!</a></em>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> fanfic <em><a class="urllink" href="https://forums.serebii.net/threads/lucki.105650/">Lucki<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> is famous for having received nothing but mindless praise from its reviewers despite having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a> as its protagonist, and no one suspecting a thing, cheering her on even as her conduct gets worse and worse, until the final chapter where the world comes to an end as a direct result of her intransigence, at which point the author revealed the main character was a Sue all along and castigated the reviewers for having fallen for it just because she lost a few battles. Except that the part about the story getting mindless praise is only really true after chapter six or so. Before then, a few reviewers pointed out issues they saw and warned the author that Lucki could become a Sue if she were not careful, even if none of the reviews went into detailed constructive criticism up to the authors ordinary standards. The reason the critical reviews dropped off is that most competent writers arent going to sit through six chapters of mediocre writing with a cliche plot, leaving only the inexperienced reviewers left, so only those who <em>kept reading to the end</em>  a minority of the readership  were fooled.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/OldManHenderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/OldManHenderson">Old Man Henderson</a></em> is frequently said to be about a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu">Call of Cthulhu</a></em> campaign. Close, but no cigar: the campaign was actually from a similar game called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TrailOfCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TrailOfCthulhu">Trail of Cthulhu</a></em>.

<ul><li> Everyone knows that "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" was written to honor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, except that it was not. The song is actually an old folk song that had new lyrics added by American writer Julia Ward Howe, inspired by an early battle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">the Civil War</a>; it was honoring the army of the Union, not the President.
</li><li> "Jingle Bells" was written as a Christmas and holiday season song, right? Actually, wrong. When <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingle_Bells">originally written in 1857<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by James Lord Pierpont, it was intended to be sung on <em>Thanksgiving</em>.
</li><li> Despite it being disproven for years, there are still people who are convinced that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PuffTheMagicDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PuffTheMagicDragon">Puff the Magic Dragon</a>" is nothing but a long, badly-hidden drug reference, as is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">Bob Dylan</a>'s "Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefrainFromAssuming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefrainFromAssuming">Refrain from Assuming</a>: "Everybody Must Get Stoned"). There are similarly incorrect but persistent rumors about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>'s "Purple Haze" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>' ("<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SgtPeppersLonelyHeartsClubBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SgtPeppersLonelyHeartsClubBand">Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds</a>").
<ul><li> When it comes to poor old Puff, people aren't just sure it's about drugs, but will state that the writers intended it to be, despite both Leonard Lipton and Peter Yarrow of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterPaulAndMary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterPaulAndMary">Peter, Paul and Mary</a>, who first recorded it, strenuously denying this. Paul Stookey even went as far as to say that when they recorded the song, none of them had even tried marijuana or had any interest in promoting it (not hard to believe when one looks at PP&amp;M's general output).
</li><li> When one actually listens to the lyrics, it becomes obvious that "Puff, the Magic Dragon" can't be about marijuana. Supposedly, Jackie Paper is a reference to rolling papers and their adventures are meant to represent a drug trip. However, marijuana doesn't cause hallucinations, so the only "adventures" Puff and Jackie would have would be sitting blazed on the couch considering ordering a pizza. Then there's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">final verse</a>, which highlights the fact that, although they both started off young and grew up together, Puff, as a dragon, is immortal while Jackie, as a human, is not, and thus, Puff has to face life without his childhood friend. Wouldn't such an ending be guaranteed to harsh your buzz?
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, "Purple Haze" is a love song where Jimi Hendrix describes a dream he had where he was walking under the ocean.
</li><li> And "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" is what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a>'s young son Julian titled his drawing, not a thinly veiled LSD reference (the original drawing can be found on Google Images). Bandmate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a> later suggested that it actually was about the drug, but Lennon constantly denied it.
</li></ul></li><li> The Norwegian band Nightcore is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nightcore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nightcore">Nightcore</a>, a type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeedyTechnoRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeedyTechnoRemake">Speedy Techno Remake</a> involving speeding up slow dance/techno/trance songs to turn them into much faster and upbeat "nightcore versions". The group Nightcore <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny">never actually did this</a>; the name is simply a reference to their prominence as one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifiers</a> of the Happy Hardcore variety of EDM- which is what the typical "Nightcore version" of a song ends up sounding like.
</li><li> Ragtime music is sometimes associated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression">The Great Depression</a> era, but its popularity actually mostly died around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> and by the '30s was as far from its heyday of mainstream popularity as Disco music was in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grunge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grunge">Grunge</a> is today. The misconception was largely fueled by the 1973 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSting">The Sting</a></em>, which featured a prominent ragtime soundtrack and was set in 1936.
</li><li> Everyone knows that The Kingsmen's version of Richard Berry's "Louie Louie" was the filthiest, most obscene song you could commonly hear on the radio (before such controversy caused people to lash out against it, including an <a class="urllink" href="https://www.npr.org/2015/05/02/403623915/louie-louie-indecipherable-or-indecent-an-fbi-investigation">FBI investigation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that finally released an 1100-page report concluding that they couldn't tell if there were any harmful effects to "Louie, Louie" or not, because they couldn't understand the words). In fact, it's just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible">completely unintelligible</a> telling of a simple story about a sailor looking forward to reuniting with his girlfriend. The creators themselves have gotten into screaming matches with fans over what the lyrics "allegedly" are.
</li><li> Many people still think that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Warrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Warrant">Warrant</a> hated the song "Cherry Pie." This isn't actually true. It is true it was something they wrote quickly, but they don't hate it and have said as much. The songwriter just flipped out during an interview because his life was falling apart at the time during the question about that particular song.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Vocaloid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Vocaloid">Vocaloid</a></em>:
<ul><li> Vocaloid did not start in Japan; it started in the UK, with English speaking vocals. The misconception comes from Miku Hatsune's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter">Breakout Character</a> status, as she happens to be a Japanese Vocaloid. Additionally, Vocaloids were not initially intended to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualCelebrity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualCelebrity">virtual celebrities</a>; they were intended to be backing vocals for "real" singers but became celebrities when people started to realize that they can make them sing on their own, too.
</li><li> When the above became common knowledge, Miku was then labeled the first Vocaloid made for the VOCALOID2 engine. This is also not true; the first V2 Vocaloid was an English voicebank named Sweet Ann. Miku's the second, but she was the first <em>Japanese</em> bank made for the engine. Ann herself is either thought of as an American or British bank, but she actually was made in Sweden (hence the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">Punny Name</a>).
</li><li> The Crypton Future Media Vocaloids aren't the "main characters" of Vocaloid, nor are the other corporations' Vocaloids "support" characters for this group. While heavily promoted, the Crypton Vocaloids are merely a few out of many voicebanks. Gumi and Gackpo aren't Crypton creations either; they're from Internet Co, Ltd.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a> writes more than just parodies of specific songs. In fact, his albums have almost as many (if not more) original songs (as well as, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode">usually</a>, a polka medley) as they do direct parodies. Most of these songs parody the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheStyleOf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheStyleOf">style</a></em> of an artist, but not any song specifically. Also, "Weird Al" Yankovic is not the only artist to do parodies, but many (unofficial) music downloading sites incorrectly list Yankovic (many times spelled as Yankovich) as the performer of nearly every parody available for download, even if it's obviously sung by a woman. There's even a "Not by Al" website listing the parodies he's been incorrectly associated with. Fewer people might think this now due to the rising popularity of song parodies on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Genesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Genesis">Genesis</a> was once a cool <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock">Progressive Rock</a> band with an inventive, creative sound under the guidance of lead singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterGabriel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterGabriel">Peter Gabriel</a>. Then Gabriel left, and drummer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilCollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilCollins">Phil Collins</a> took over as lead singer, and that was the end of that. Collins prefers wimpy adult contemporary that does its best not to offend anyone, including straight love ballads that sound like cheesy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelBolton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelBolton">Michael Bolton</a> ripoffs, so that's all Genesis' music became. Except that's not true at all. It might be true of Collins's solo material, but while Genesis definitely became more commercial and radio-friendly, that was already happening before Gabriel left, and Collins was not at all the ringleader in that regard. Not to mention it wasn't all cheesy 80's synth and love ballads. At their most commercial, Genesis put out the hard-rock <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtestSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtestSong">Protest Song</a> anthem "Land of Confusion", the superbly creepy "Mama", the attack on hypocritical religious leaders "Jesus He Knows Me", the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">Domestic Abuse</a>-themed "No Son of Mine" and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner">Blade Runner</a></em>-inspired "Tonight Tonight Tonight".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a>'s "Bohemian Rhapsody" still regularly gets mentioned as the first music video. It wasn't, by quite a way, though it may have been the moment at which the medium <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">Grew The Beard</a>.
</li><li> The much-publicized clip of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus">Miley Cyrus</a> gyrating on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobinThicke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobinThicke">Robin Thicke</a> at the 2013 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV">MTV</a> Video Music Awards may have led to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShakingTheRump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShakingTheRump">twerk</a>" becoming a household word overnight, but anyone who actually knew the term "twerking" before that night will know full well that that's <em>not</em> what Cyrus was doing in the clip. The dance move that she did on stage during Thicke's performance of "Blurred Lines" would be more accurately described as "grinding".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheLas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheLas">The La's</a> song "There She Goes" is well-known for being about heroin; however the artists deny that interpretation.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Juggalo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Juggalo">Juggalo</a>" is not just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanCommunityNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanCommunityNickname">Fan Community Nickname</a> for fans of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/InsaneClownPosse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/InsaneClownPosse">Insane Clown Posse</a>. The term more accurately applies to fans of the record label <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PsychopathicRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PsychopathicRecords">Psychopathic Records</a>, which was <em>founded</em> by Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope. ICP is the most well-known group on the label's roster by a pretty wide margin, but it also includes quite a few lesser-known rap acts who share ICP's love of face paint, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">theatrical alter egos</a>, horror-themed subject matter, and grotesque humor (not to mention a few of ICP's frequent collaborators like Wolfpac, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TechN9ne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TechN9ne">Tech N9ne</a>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KottonmouthKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KottonmouthKings">Kottonmouth Kings</a>, who are considered "honorary" family members). Having "The Great Milenko" and "The Amazing Jeckel Brothers" in one's record collection doesn't necessarily make someone a Juggalo by default, but owning albums by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Twiztid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Twiztid">Twiztid</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AnybodyKilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AnybodyKilla">Anybody Killa</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Boondox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Boondox">Boondox</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlazeYaDeadHomie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlazeYaDeadHomie">Blaze Ya Dead Homie</a> <em>definitely</em> does. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1aeew');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1aeew" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1aeew');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Case in point: if you've actually heard of any of those artists, you're probably a Juggalo.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">Bob Dylan</a> introduced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> to pot in 1964... no he didn't. They'd already tried it during their Hamburg stint, along with many other illicit substances. It would be more accurate to say he introduced them to <em>high-quality</em> pot.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr">Ringo Starr</a> was the good-natured everyman who was lucky enough to be bought into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> because previous drummer Pete Best was too handsome and drawing attention away from the others, right? In fact, Ringo Starr was already a bigger name than the Beatles as drummer for Rory Storm and the Hurricanes where he was given his own solo spot "Starr Time" and the Beatles had been trying to poach him long before Pete Best was thrown out of the group — largely because he just wasn't good enough a drummer to cope with the recording studio.
</li><li> All of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GreenDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GreenDay">Green Day</a>'s songs are exactly the same, right? Not so. This stems from the fact that in their 90s discography, they had a tendency to overuse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeChordsAndTheTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeChordsAndTheTruth">Three Chords and the Truth</a>, particularly on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Dookie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Dookie">Dookie</a></em>. In actuality, the band works in two-album cycles with songs and sounds that sound similar to each other. The fact that they actually worked to expand their sound by 1997 on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nimrod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nimrod">nimrod.</a></em>, then diversified their sound <em>a lot</em> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Warning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Warning">Warning</a></em> really cements this. Any actual fan of the band will tell you this. In terms of their range expanding, they have <em>Warning</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AmericanIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AmericanIdiot">American Idiot</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TwentyFirstCenturyBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TwentyFirstCenturyBreakdown">21st Century Breakdown</a></em> to really show their range musically, not even counting their side projects, The Network (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWaveMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWaveMusic">New Wave Music</a>) and The Foxboro Hottubs (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarageRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarageRock">Garage Rock</a>). In fact, their 2012 album trilogy really shows off their range quite nicely, with Power Pop and Pop Punk indicative of their early albums, the Punk and Garage Rock of their middle albums, then the more stadium-oriented and political music of the two albums before the trilogy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeepPurple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeepPurple">Deep Purple</a> memorably blamed the Montreux Casino fire on "some stupid with a flare gun" in "Smoke on the Water", but it's actually not completely clear how the fire started. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa">Frank Zappa</a>'s recollection was that an audience member shot a bottle rocket into the ceiling. Another witness said the audience member was actually lighting matches, tossing them in the air, and catching them, only to have one match go too high. It's also been suggested that it was caused by faulty wiring.
</li><li> Everyone knows that one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges">the great mysteries</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockAndRoll">Rock &amp; Roll</a> is what exactly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MeatLoaf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MeatLoaf">Meat Loaf</a> "won't do" in "I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)". Except it's not; he says it right in the lyrics (just not in the chorus). He makes a different promise to his lover in each verse: first <em>"I'll never forget the way you feel right now"</em>, then <em>"I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way tonight"</em>, then <em>"I'll never do it better than I do it with you"</em>, and finally <em>"I'll never stop dreaming of you every night of my life"</em>. Then at the conclusion, his lover predicts <em>"You'll see that it's time to move on"</em> and <em>"You'll be screwing around"</em>, and he emphatically responds <em>"I won't do that!"</em> to both.

Only their first album <em>You Brought Me Your Bullets, I Brought You My Love</em> could really be classified as a straight example of Emo music, and that one was made when the band was (by their own admission) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">still trying to figure out their sound</a>; by the time they had become widely-known with <em>Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge</em>, they had almost entirely abandoned it in favor of a more fast-paced, upbeat pop sound with occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GothicHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GothicHorror">Gothic Horror</a>-inspired lyrics.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana">Nirvana</a>:
<ul><li> They did <strong>not</strong> originate in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seattle">Seattle</a>; they actually came from the small town of Aberdeen, about two hours away from the Emerald City. The confusion is understandable since they did play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grunge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grunge">Grunge</a> (also known as the "Seattle Sound"), they were based in Seattle after making it big, and they were responsible for Seattle becoming well-known in mainstream popular culture.
</li><li> They're often called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">the Beatles</a> of the '90s", due to the common belief that they did for alternative music what the Fab Four did for rock n' roll. While no one can dispute Nirvana's commercial success or artistic influence, their rivals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PearlJam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PearlJam">Pearl Jam</a> consistently outsold them when they were together, and they never really outstripped them in popularity until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter">after Kurt Cobain's death</a>. And during the same period, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a> were also at the height of their popularity, and R&amp;B and hip-hop were breaking into the mainstream.

While Nirvana's discography <em>is</em> a lot smaller than many other bands of comparable influence (due to the band abruptly splitting up after Kurt's death), they did release a full-length album (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>) on the then-independent label Sub Pop before hitting it big with <em>Nevermind</em>, and they stuck together long enough to release a follow-up to <em>Nevermind</em> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/InUtero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/InUtero">In Utero</a></em>) that became a major hit in its own right—though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow">not quite on the level of its predecessor</a>.

While he did popularize it, the genre existed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">good decade or so</a> in the UK before Skrillex got big. Also, people seem to be under the impression that Skrillex is a dubstep producer because it made him famous, and that's all he's made as far as they're concerned. In reality, his repertoire is as diverse as trap, electro house, deep house, dance-pop, acid techno, future bass, and hip-hop. That's not without getting into the fact that he broke into the music industry as a <em>rock singer</em> for the band From First to Last, which he has since rejoined.

The opening lyrics are <em>"Para bailar la Bamba"</em>, which means <em>"To dance the Bamba..."</em>.

The song actually debuted in 1999 (<em>Shrek</em> came out in 2001), and it was featured in the soundtracks of multiple films before <em>Shrek</em>, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InspectorGadget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InspectorGadget">Inspector Gadget</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MysteryMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MysteryMen">Mystery Men</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTheMovie">Digimon: The Movie</a></em>.

</li><li> A common misconception is that "Ring Around the Rosie" is about the Black Death— that "ring around the rosie" refers to the round rash on people's hands, "a pocketful of posies" is either the flowers at people's funerals, a weird euphemism for lesions, or the flowers that plague doctors gave, "atishoo!" is because sneezing was one symptom of the plague (and sometimes, this is replaced with "ashes", which they think refers to people's ashy skin or the burning of bedclothes or bodies) and "we all fall down" refers to death. This is highly unlikely— the rhyme was first recorded five centuries after the plague, and there are many variations on the rhyme quite different from the one we have now.

During his first run, he would usually lose once or twice a month. He did even worse during his second run, losing over a third of his matches.

The reason for this misconception might be because champions in the mid-'90s did tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero">Invincible Heroes</a>. Contrast Hogan in 1984-87 with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart">Bret Hart</a>'s run as the top face a decade later: during that timeframe Hogan lost 55 matches and Hart lost 15. It should however be pointed out that most of Hogan's losses during that time period (especially in the WWF) were by countout, not from being pinned or submitting. Nowadays, countouts are considered a cop-out finish and rarely ever used. And his subsequent run in WCW, to be fair, did have him utilize his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors">"Creative Control" card</a> quite often. <br/><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/WrestleCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/WrestleCrap">RD Reynolds</a> has acknowledged Hogan's loss record, but pointed out that there's a difference between <em>losing</em> and <em>putting someone over</em> — when Hogan loses a match, it's usually a case of him inflicting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> until suddenly being defeated via a dirty trick. This is against the entire point of jobbing since it fails to make the winning wrestler look strong (after all, they were getting thrashed until they suddenly won). It may be this factor that gives us the "Hogan never loses" belief.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> tends to be remembered as much more squeaky-clean (if not boring) than his actions at the time would suggest. For instance, while 1984's Hulk vs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheIronSheik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheIronSheik">The Iron Sheik</a> is remembered as a cartoonish battle of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAmericanFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAmericanFace">All-American Face</a> vs. the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignWrestlingHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignWrestlingHeel">Foreign Wrestling Heel</a>, it's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdw86uAUg">Hogan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> who starts the match with a flurry of cheap shots. He was also fond of back rakes and face stomps, both heel tactics, and wasn't above using "bad powder" and chairshots on opponents when the ref was distracted. This is because Hogan was trained to wrestle as a heel and had been one until his run in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AWA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AWA">AWA</a>.
</li><li> At <em> Over the Edge 1999</em>, no one watching on PPV saw <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/OwenHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/OwenHart">Owen Hart</a> fall to his death. He was being lowered to the ring during a pre-taped interview segment backstage prior to the accident.
</li><li> Several people claim that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels">Shawn Michaels</a> gave up the WWF Title because he "lost his smile". However, they are confusing two very different promos that happened months apart. At Survivor Series '96, Shawn lost the belt to his one time friend Sycho Sid after Sid attacked Michaels' mentor and manager Jose Lothario; a week later, HBK gave an interview where the always upbeat former champion said the event caused to be afraid for his mentor's safety and it hurt him more than losing the belt, it made him lose his smile. Two months later, Michaels regained the belt at the Royal Rumble, but suffered a severe knee injury and needed surgery, so he would be out of action for at least six months and maybe permanently. He gave up the title in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a> speech where he made a brief reference to the earlier promo. <br/>It also became common knowledge that he only claimed to have lost his smile so he would not have to lose the title to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart">Bret Hart</a> at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a></em> and did not even need surgery. This is strange for a couple of reasons: First, Michael's surgery was covered on TV — they even showed footage of him getting the operation done — and he walked with a cane on TV for several weeks while he recovered and returned to his old job as a commentator. Secondly, Hart was at the time the most booed face in the company after his 7-month vacation and feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a>, so it is unlikely that they would give him the belt at the biggest event of the year; also, they did give him a brief reign by winning the Final Four and losing it the next night to Sycho Sid, so they could have easily had Hart as champion at WrestleMania without Michaels, he just was not over enough to justify it.

<ul><li> Despite their world-famous team name, the Harlem Globetrotters are <em>not</em> a real competing basketball team; they are an athletic/comedic theatrical act made up of talented basketball players. All of their "games" are pre-rehearsed spectacles and almost always result in them winning (they are only known to lose by accident, and this happens very rarely).
</li><li> Contrary to popular belief, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague">Oakland Raiders Owner/GM Al Davis</a> was neither a member of "The Foolish Club", the eight original team owners of the American Football League (AFL)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5y7xx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5y7xx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5y7xx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The actual Club, for the record, was H.A. "Bud" Adams (Houston Oilers), Barron Hilton (Los Angeles Chargers), Bob Howsam (Denver Broncos), Lamar Hunt (Dallas Texans), Billy Sullivan (Boston Patriots), F.Wayne Valley (Oakland Raiders), Ralph Wilson (Buffalo Bills) and Harry Wismer (New York Titans). </span> nor was he the Raiders original head coach. Davis did not assume control of the Raiders until 1967. He was an assistant coach under Hall of Fame coach Sid Gillman for the Los Angeles/San Diego Chargers for the AFL's first three seasons (1960-1962), and head coach of the Raiders (hired by actual original Raiders owner F. Wayne Valley) from 1963 to 1965, before handing things over to John Rauch (Which is yet another bit of "common knowledge": John Madden was not Davis' immediate successor - he was Davis' defensive line coach and Rauch's defensive coordinator).
</li><li> Speaking of the AFL: Upon his death in 2014, Buffalo Bills owner Ralph Wilson was not the last member of the Foolish Club. He was the last surviving <em>active</em> member. Baron Hilton, the original Chargers owner, is still alive. He sold the team to an investment group in 1963, at the request of the other members of the Hilton family.
</li><li> The so-called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleBreakerRuleNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleBreakerRuleNamer">Tom Brady Rule</a>" (which prohibited a defensive player from hitting quarterbacks below the knee) was wrongly attributed to Tom Brady after his season-ending knee injury during the 2008 NFL season. It's unofficially called the "Carson Palmer Rule"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6afr7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6afr7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6afr7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Rule 12, Section 2, Article 13(5)</span> (which Brady calls his knee injury in a <a class="urllink" href="http://itiswhatitis.weei.com/sports/newengland/football/patriots/2011/09/19/transcript-of-tom-brady-on-dc-i-wont-ever-say-that-again-about-drinking-before-games/2011">interview with WEEI radio<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), which was passed back at the start of the 2006 season after Cincinnati Bengals QB Carson Palmer suffered the same injury during the 2005 playoffs against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The actual "Brady Rule" (which was passed back in 2009) was <a class="urllink" href="http://articles.boston.com/2009-03-24/sports/29263608_1_brady-rule-chiefs-safety-bernard-pollard-knee">a clarification to the existing "Palmer Rule"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by stating the following:

</div></li><li> The general consensus on the 2007 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scandalgate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scandalgate">Spygate</a> scandal is that the New England Patriots were cheaters. In actuality, the Patriots were punished for recording the New York Jets' defensive signals <em>from an illegal location</em> (i.e., the sidelines). Also, Super Bowl-winning coaches Jimmy Johnson, Bill Cowher, Dick Vermeil, and Mike Shanahan admitted to doing the same thing, and stated that the filming of the opponents' signals was common practice back then. Finally, the Patriots were punished <em>after</em> the rule prohibiting the recording of signals from an illegal location was passed at the start of the 2007 season.
</li><li> Speaking of the 2007 season, David Tyree's miracle late 4th quarter helmet catch in Super Bowl XLII did <em>not</em> win the game for the New York Football Giants. The winning touchdown was scored later when Eli Manning hit Plexico Burress. The catch <em>did</em> give the Giants excellent field position and helped continue what turned out to be the game-winning drive. However there were several plays between the catch and the win, and the Patriots defence actually forced a 3rd and long in that time. Not to mention that when New England got the ball back, Tom Brady got <em>this</em> close to setting up a game-tying field goal. The Patriots rightly rue the catch, but they still did have a chance to win regardless.
</li><li> Everyone knows that Pete Carroll's call to pass on the one-yard line (leading to an interception) in the dying moments of Super Bowl XLIX, instead of handing it off to Marshawn Lynch, was the worst call ever. This is mostly based on the immediate reactions of the announcer Cris Collinsworth, who called it the "dumbest". What's forgotten is that after Kearse's circus catch got the Seahawks to the goal line (remember the aforementioned example?), Seattle did in fact hand off to Lynch and the Patriots stopped him. For the next snap, the Patriots were expecting the ball to be sent to Lynch and throwing was the right idea...indeed the Patriots Defensive Coordinator <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6QDzQgihQ">later said<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that the call was the right one. To wit, Lynch was heavily covered, and his actual record in such situations is fairly poor. The goal-line interception was the only one that season and it required the defender to read the play and adjust in time. It was basically a 1-1000 situation.
</li><li> On the issue of the Patriots, everyone knows that Tom Brady was an unknown late-round pick, who was put in for the injured starter and won the Super Bowl (and a lot more over the years)? Actually, Brady played for Michigan, one of the top programs in the country, and threw for 4 touchdowns against Alabama in the Orange Bowl. He was well known to College football fans as seen in the original ESPN draft announcement (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dt7JaSCft0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dt7JaSCft0<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> ). People who had followed Brady gave him a high grade. He fell on Draft Day for a variety of reasons, including having had an unimpressive combine, having to share playing time, and a dearth of open slots for quarterbacks that year.
</li><li> Everybody knows that Tom Brady was just a game manager for his first three titles, and relied on the defence. It is true that the Patriots put out some masterclass performances in big games in that era (notably against Kurt Warner in Super Bowl XXXVI and Peyton Manning in the 2003/2004 AFC Championship), but Bill Belichick has always been a first-rate defence coach. Brady led plenty of game-winning drives and comeback wins. In Super Bowl XXXVIII, the Patriots defence was unable to stop the Panthers and needed Brady.
</li><li> Everyone knows that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts">Mixed Martial Arts</a> is the combat sport where there are no rules. Except that there are tons of rules. Just as many, if not more, rules than other combat sports like boxing and amateur wrestling. The misconception stems from the early days of the UFC, which had hardly any rules, but it did have a few. In fact, the relative lack of rules was intentional: As early UFC was meant to be a showcase of different fighting styles (wrestling vs. boxing vs. judo vs. kickboxing), the fewer hard/fast rules there were, the freer the participants were to utilize their techniques in full. As more and more fighters began to adopt the style of the dominant Gracie brothers (a mix of grappling and striking), it became easier for UFC to institute more uniform rules.
</li><li> Mention "the underarm incident" to any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cricket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cricket">cricket</a> fan, and they'll know you're talking about the 1981 ODI where the Australian bowler Trevor Chappell bowled an underarm delivery to deny the New Zealand batsman Brian McKechnie a chance to hit a six and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownToTheLastPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownToTheLastPlay">win the game off the last ball</a>. All correct, except for the last bit: New Zealand were actually 6 runs behind Australia and could only aim for a <em>tie</em> by hitting a six.
</li><li> Everyone knows that the Boston Red Sox had the 1986 World Series locked up against the New York Mets when first baseman Bill Buckner let a ground ball bounce between his legs, costing the Red Sox the championship, right? Well...not quite. The Red Sox <em>did</em> come within one strike of winning the Series, and the Mets' winning run of that game <em>did</em> score when the ball went through Buckner's legs, but what everyone forgets is that there was a whole string of Red Sox F-ups in between those things that led to the game being <em>TIED</em> when Buckner made the error. There are a handful of people who could be considered more blameworthy than Buckner for the loss, including Roger Clemens (who, as the starting pitcher, insisted on trying to close out the game despite having a blister on his throwing hand), Calvin Schiraldi (who relieved Clemens and was pitching when the tying runs got on base), catcher Rich Gedman (whose passed ball caused one of the runs to score), and manager John McNamara (who, for sentimental reasons, insisted on having the aging and injured Buckner on the field when the game appeared to be in the bag, rather than the more reliable Dave Stapleton). On top of all of that, pitcher Bob Stanley appeared to be a bit slow getting over to cover first base on the play and there's no way the aging Buckner could've made the forceout unassisted; indeed, the Mets batter who hit that ball was officially credited with an infield single, with the error being assessed solely because the winning run scored all the way from second base whereas a clean fielding by Buckner would've stopped him at third. The other thing people forget is that the Buckner game was game <em>SIX</em> of the Series, which the Sox had previously led 3 games to 2. Buckner's error didn't cause the Mets to win the championship, merely forced Game 7. In the final game, the Sox jumped out to an early 3-0 lead, but pitcher Bruce Hurst was unable to hold the lead, and the Mets won the Series. The most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> part is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">Boston fans</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Misblamed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Misblamed">misblamed</a> Buckner for years, to the point where his kids were harassed in school, until he ended up moving his family to Idaho, where nobody cared about baseball or knew who he was, and working as a car salesman.
</li><li> Everyone knows Minnesota Vikings lost the 1998 NFC title game to Atlanta Falcons because Gary Anderson missed a field goal. In reality the Vikings were actually leading 27-20 when he missed. If anything is to blame it should be Vikings defense for giving up a last minute drive to a limping Chris Chandler (although they lost 5 starters to injury by that moment) and Denny Green deciding to kneel down and play for overtime despite having one of the greatest offenses in league history.
</li><li> Everyone 'knows' the term "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">soccer</a>" is strictly an American word that was made up by the United States to differentiate the round-ball game from American Football, and that "football" is the <em>true</em> name for the sport. Europeans, particularly Brits, have been known to get outright <em>violent</em> over that word. However, the word "soccer" actually originates in <em>England</em>, not the USA. It is derived from "as<strong>soc</strong>iation football", the sport's full name, which differentiates it from other codes of football such as rugby. It spread across the world until it eventually reached the US, where "soccer" was adopted there. The term has subsequently largely dropped out of use in Britain, especially in England — but this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink">Newer Than They Think</a>, too: it only fell from favour as recently as the 1990s, and British monthly magazine <em>World Soccer</em> (est. 1960), for instance, is still in print under that title. In other words, any Brits who get angry over the word soccer have nobody to blame but themselves. Also, it's not uncommon for someone to say that only Americans use the word soccer. Actually, it's also used in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, all of which have other codes of football predominating.
<ul><li> And to undercut the obvious argument that American Football is misnamed because it isn't primarily played <em>with</em> the feet — well, neither are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RugbyUnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RugbyUnion">Rugby</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RugbyLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RugbyLeague">Football</a>, Gaelic Football or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianRulesFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianRulesFootball">Australian Rules Football</a>. The word more likely came about in medieval times to denote any mass team game played <em>on</em> foot, as opposed to on horseback.

No, it wasn't. Gary Gygax <em>hated</em> Tolkien — he only incorporated elements such as halflings and treants on the insistence of his gaming group, who wanted to play as Frodo.

</li><li> <em>D&amp;D</em> players gain extensive knowledge of historical armor types such as plate mail, chainmail, ringmail, splint mail, etc. Incorrect knowledge, to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">Critical Research Failure</a>. There has historically been exactly one type of armor made from interlocking rings, and its name is simply <strong>mail</strong>. Likewise, the correct term for "plate mail" is plate armor, and the one for "scale mail" is scale armor. But many more people have played <em>D&amp;D</em> and its various derivatives than have a cursory knowledge of real-world armor.
</li><li> Likewise, a "long sword" is a one-handed sword commonly wielded alongside a shield, right? Wrong, a long sword is a two-handed sword, and is neither light enough nor properly balanced for being used in one hand. The sword commonly referred to as a "long sword" in <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> is actually more akin to the real-life arming sword.
</li><li> The game is heavily steeped in the Occult, and the "deeper" you go into the game, the more you are called upon to actually recite Occultic prayers, cast real spells and summon real demons with incantations based on actual pagan rituals. None of that is true and is all based on the completely made-up testimony of Patricia Pulling, who blamed the game for her son's suicide and later claimed to be an expert on it while attempting to get the game banned. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7rbnv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7rbnv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7rbnv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There is a small kernel of truth to the legend — in the First Edition DMG, there are template summoning circles, some of which look like they may have been cribbed from real-world thaumaturgy, depicted for summoning elementals (and <em>not</em> demons) in the DM's glosses on adjudicating spells. Gary Gygax most likely intended these as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">Obvious Rule Patch</a> to make summoning by his players' characters a bit more onerous, time-consuming and expensive (and to give the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGameMaster">Killer Game Master</a> some fun if the character screwed it up).</span> In fact, <em>D&amp;D</em> as a whole could be considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMoralSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMoralSubstitute">The Moral Substitute</a> compared to many other RPGs; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality">good and evil is clearly defined,</a> the protagonist classes include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus">paladins and clerics</a> while the antagonists include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell">The Legions of Hell</a>, and Gary Gygax himself was reluctant to include stats for angels (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsGood">which are always Good</a>) because he thought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordBritishPostulate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordBritishPostulate">players might be tempted to kill them otherwise.</a>

What kind of idiot wanders into a dungeon to fight monsters with an instrument? The kind of idiot who's going to save the whole party, as it turns out. Over the course of <em>D&amp;D</em>'s many editions, bards have been a mid-tier class at worst, and often edge on being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower">one of the best</a>.

The 2e bard, the first one to become a regular class, was a more than serviceable caster and thief, and often preferable to the actual thief. The 3.5 bard was the most powerful core class <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">not considered an outright</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>.

Though some versions have been poorly designed or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">Difficult, but Awesome</a>, the class as a whole has never been weak. A mixture of new players failing to understand their mechanics and how they synergize with each other, the longstanding trope of the comic-relief <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WanderingMinstrel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WanderingMinstrel">Wandering Minstrel</a>, and the crappiness of Edward in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em> may be to blame for this one.

Among those who know that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/MesopotamianMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/MesopotamianMythology">Tiamat</a> wasn't actually a dragon originally, it's widely believed that this inaccuracy originated with <em>D&amp;D</em>. This is objectively wrong, since Tiamat's been described as a dragon in (non-fiction) literature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">as early as 1888</a>. <em>D&amp;D</em> did basically make up Tiamat's design from scratch, though.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller">Traveller</a></em> has a reputation for being one of the few tabletop games in which your character can die during character creation, which has players roll to determine what events occurred in their life, good and bad beforehand rather than having the player dictate their past. While this was true when the game first came out, this was quickly made into an optional rule in the 1980's and only recently brought back as of 2018. In any event, this is an exceedingly rare thing to have happen, to the point where in order for your character to die this way, it'd have to be nigh-deliberate, such as having that character refuse to seek medical attention for a grievous injury. Despite this, the game is still mistakenly known for "the one that kills you in character creation" as if it happens all the time, causing some potential players to avoid or demean the game for this reason alone.

<ul><li> Every fan knows that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreDifferent">Squats</a> were driven to extinction by the Tyranids in order to facilitate their removal as a playable faction in the third edition of the game. Not many realize that this has been retconned as of sixth edition and that they've been mentioned in other army books as a thriving race in the galaxy still, just without their own army list. On that note, Squats weren't removed as a faction because they were considered "too silly" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a> has always been a cornerstone of <em>40K</em>, after all) or because the models weren't selling, but because Games Workshop themselves didn't know what to do with them, and there was nothing the Squats could do that wasn't already covered by other factions.
</li><li> Similarly, Malal, the fifth Chaos God, is commonly alluded to in the context of <em>40K</em>. Not only is Malal no longer canon, but he was also <em>never</em> canon to <em>40K</em>. He briefly did exist in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a> Fantasy</em> setting, but Games Workshop had already lost the rights to use him by the time Chaos was added as a faction in <em>40K</em>. The closest there is is the Sons of Malice warband, which uses a lot of Malal iconography as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">Mythology Gag</a>, but for obvious reasons, Malal himself is never mentioned.

<ul><li> The Chinese word for "crisis" is made up of the characters for "danger" and "opportunity". The word in question, 危机 (<em>wēijī</em>), does have two characters, but the more accurate translation would be: "dangerous" (危, <em>wēi</em>) and "change point" (机, "jī"). The confusion probably stems from <em>jī</em> being the first character in the actual word for "opportunity" (机会, <em>jīhui</em> ).
</li><li> "Avocado" derives from the Aztec word for "testicle". No, the word <em>āhuacatl</em> always meant "avocado". It was sometimes used informally to mean "testicle" because of the similar shapes of the two items, much as "balls" is used as a slang term in English.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder11');">    Theatre </div><div class="folder" id="folder11" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> One of the most well-known numbers from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Chicago">Chicago</a></em> is the "Cell Block Tango" (which everyone knows is called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefrainFromAssuming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefrainFromAssuming">They Had It Coming</a>"), in which six women on trial for murdering their lovers protest their innocence, even though the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">audience knows better</a>. Except... only three of them make even a flimsy attempt to claim innocence of the crime. June says her husband "ran into my knife. He ran into my knife <em>ten times</em>", and Velma claims to not remember anything between opening the hotel-room door to see her man and her sister getting busy and "washing the blood off my hands". The sixth, The Hunyak, actually is innocent. The other three freely admit to it, though they also insist that the murders were justified, for whatever reason.
</li><li> Despite casual references to him as "the fiddler", Tevye, the milkman and lead character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/FiddlerOnTheRoof" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/FiddlerOnTheRoof">Fiddler on the Roof</a></em>, is decidedly not the title character, nor is the title character an actual character. He is a visual representation of what it's like for a people bound by ancient tradition to live in an environment that is hostile to said traditions.
</li><li> "Pirate" is never <em>rhymed with</em> "pilot" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ThePiratesOfPenzance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ThePiratesOfPenzance">The Pirates of Penzance</a></em>, even in the song about Ruth's confusion between the two words.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s plays:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></em>:
<ul><li> While the famous line "O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?" is usually quoted right, more or less, most people are unaware of the true meaning, often believing that Juliet is asking "Where are you, Romeo?" Note that "wherefore" does not mean "where", it means "why". Compare "therefore". In other words, Juliet is asking <em>why</em> Romeo must be who he is, a member of the family with which her own family has a long-standing feud.
</li><li> And everybody "knows" that Juliet delivers that line from a balcony. <em>Of course</em> she does — it's the famous "balcony scene", isn't it? Well... no. It may typically be staged that way, but what the playscript actually says is that Juliet appears at a <em>window</em>.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Romeo:</strong> But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
</div><ul><li> What's more, balconies had only recently been invented in Italy, and were unknown in England at the time, as well as being considered rather vulgar.
</li><li> Also, "star-crossed lovers" is <em>not</em> a synonym for "happily ever after". It means that they are ill-fated, that destiny is against them. ("Stars" stand in for "fate", and "crossed" in this case is akin to a "double-cross", i.e. a <em>betrayal</em>. If the stars have "crossed" you, then bad things will happen to you.) They <em>die</em>. There's a reason the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers">Star-Crossed Lovers</a> trope means a relationship is doomed to <em>failure</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet">Hamlet</a></em>:
<ul><li> The play is known for the much-parodied <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureScene">Signature Scene</a> in which Hamlet contemplatively holds the skull of his dead friend Yorick and delivers the "To be or not to be..." soliloquy. These are actually two separate scenes from different parts of the play. Hamlet delivers a different (and much shorter) monologue while holding the skull, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord">and it's not even a soliloquy like "To be or not to be..."</a>, as he's directing it at another character.
</li><li> The line "The lady doth protest too much, methinks" doesn't mean she complains in a suspiciously over-the-top manner. It means that she promises more than she can reasonably deliver.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTamingOfTheShrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTamingOfTheShrew">The Taming of the Shrew</a></em> ends with a woman giving a speech about how great it is to be subservient to a man. Technically true, but the introduction establishes that the play is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayWithinAPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayWithinAPlay">Play Within a Play</a> performed for a drunkard tricked into thinking he's a nobleman for shits and giggles. In that light, it comes across as more of a critical look at male fantasies about subservience than an endorsement of it.
</li><li> Many assume that the line, "The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers," from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HenryVIPart2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HenryVIPart2">Henry VI Part 2</a></em> is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLawyerJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLawyerJoke">Evil Lawyer Joke</a>. A joke, yes, but targeted at the speaker, <em>not</em> lawyers; the line is often spoken <em>way</em> out of context. First of all, the speaker — Dick the Butcher — is a thug and a killer. Second, he was saying this in reply to his friend Jack's scheme to revolt against the King, or rather, his plans should they succeed. (In a more modern setting, the joke may have started by Jack saying, "When I'm the King, there'll be two cars in every garage, and a chicken in every pot" but Dick interrupting and shouting, "AND NO LAWYERS!") In Shakespeare's time, lawyers were regarded as the protectors of truth, and Dick, being the scum he was, wanted to get rid of such people.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RichardIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RichardIII">Richard III</a></em>'s most famous line, "Now is the winter of our discontent", is not delivered during a time of great hardship or suffering. It's actually the opposite: the full line is "Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of York". Richard says it while celebrating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfTheRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfTheRoses">the House of York's victory over the House of Lancaster</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TwelfthNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TwelfthNight">Twelfth Night</a></em> — the opening speech by Orsino: "If music be the food of love, play on" is not in praise of music, or of love. It continues "Give me excess of it that, surfeiting,/The appetite may sicken, and so die", meaning that he wishes to bring his love for Olivia to and end, and asks for more music so as to achieve this through an excess of it.
</li><li> Shylock in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMerchantOfVenice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMerchantOfVenice">The Merchant of Venice</a></em> is often considered one of the most famous examples of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreedyJew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreedyJew">Greedy Jew</a>. While he is indeed a villainous Jewish money-lender, and certainly greedy, his primary motivation in the play is not greed but a desire for revenge, to the point where he refuses to spare Antonio's life in exchange for three times the amount Antonio owes him. Also, while Shylock is probably the best-known character in the play, he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotShazam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotShazam">not the titular merchant</a>; the title refers to Antonio.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Othello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Othello">Othello</a></em>: the title character's description of himself as "one that loved not wisely but too well" is often quoted to describe a victim who fell in love with an unworthy person and was ultimately jilted, betrayed or abused. This is almost the opposite of Othello and Desdemona's doomed love, though. In context, Othello means that he loved Desdemona too possessively and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">jealously</a>, making him believe Iago's lies about her infidelity and driving him to murder her.

</li><li> Jean Valjean was not an innocent man wrongly imprisoned, as a lot of people (including some of those responsible for the show) seem to believe. It was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">the length of his sentence</a> (five years of hard labor for stealing bread to feed his sister's children) that Valjean felt was unjust, as well as the fact that he was given fourteen more years for repeated escape attempts, and that his ex-convict status made it impossible to find lodging or honest work when he was released.

She's their governess — in charge of their education, not their physical care. The confusion likely stems from her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulieAndrews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulieAndrews">sharing an actress</a> and a few plot parallels with cinema's most famous nanny, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaryPoppins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaryPoppins">Mary Poppins</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Wicked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Wicked">Wicked</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Wicked</em> is commonly described by non-fans as a <em>Wizard of Oz</em> rewrite where Glinda the Good Witch is the villain and the Wicked Witch of the West is good. This is wrong on Glinda's part. She's antagonistic towards Elphaba for part of the story, but not a villain. The two are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicBromance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicBromance">best friends</a> (with a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomoeroticSubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomoeroticSubtext">Homoerotic Subtext</a> added in) who are on opposing sides.

While it is true that most ponies are female, even the original G1 line featured several colts and stallions (such as Lucky and the Big Brother Ponies). There's also a few non-pony males such as Spike and the other baby dragons. It's only G3 from the 2000s that featured no male toys (though Spike was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneGuy">The One Guy</a> in the animated adaptation), but by then this misconception was already rampant.

</li><li> Japanese toy manufacturer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BandaiNamcoEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BandaiNamcoEntertainment">Bandai</a>'s American subsidiary is commonly known either as Bandai Creation or Bandai Creations, a distinction American <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Godzilla</a></em> fans argue about endlessly. In fact, both are wrong: it's Bandai America or simply Bandai USA. Beginning from the early 2000s, many American <em>Godzilla</em> toy packages featured the word "creation" under the regular Bandai logo, denoting that the toys in question were the creations of the Bandai company. This single extra word etched itself so deeply into the minds of American buyers that all American-produced Bandai <em>Godzilla</em> toys are still widely and unquestionably referred to as Bandai Creation(s) products on fan forums, articles, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> video reviews, and even certain Wikis or toy databases, when no such company ever existed. The facts that the packages have stopped using the "creation" label after a few years, that it was never part of the official logo to begin with, and that no other American Bandai toys even featured the word seems to have gone completely unnoticed.
</li><li> Older generations who used to play with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LEGO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LEGO">LEGO</a></em> toys in their youth but aren't much familiar with it anymore like to complain that back in their day, LEGO was all about expressing your creativity by building everything you want, while these days all the sets just come with instructions forcing the kids to build everything as commanded. Not only sets with instructions have existed for decades, for most of the toy's existence, nobody's ever <em>forcing</em> anyone to build what's on the box - there's nothing different about newer sets preventing one to disregard the instructions, furthermore "creative" sets that contain nothing but just generic bricks continue to be sold as well. There <em>was</em> a time at the turn of the century of "juniorized" sets which had much simplified structures consisting of large, premade pieces that could hardly be used outside of their intended purpose, but those were poorly received and the practice was abandoned (until being brought back later to a limited degree in small 4+ Junior sets).
</li><li> Related to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle">BIONICLE</a></em>:
<ul><li> It's true that "<em>Bionicle</em> saved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LEGO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LEGO">LEGO</a>", but that's not the whole picture, despite former LEGO CEO Jørgen Vig Knudstorp being quoted as saying such. In 2003, when the company had no licensed properties to rely on (as there were no <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> movies that year), <em>Bionicle</em> was their only line that turned in a profit. However, <em>Star Wars</em> toys, the post-2000 redesign of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/LEGOCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/LEGOCity">LEGO City</a></em> theme and general behind-the-scenes management shifts were also major factors in stabilizing the company. So <em>Bionicle</em> did keep LEGO afloat in a time of need, and gave them crucial experience in managing an in-house property, tie-in media and strengthening relations with consumers, but it wasn't the only thing that kept them from going bankrupt, unless you're strictly talking about their 2003 profits. For that matter, the sales of <em>Bionicle</em> toys have been on a decline at that time too.
</li><li> The infamous "Maori controversy" is a giant ball of misconstrued half truths. The common version goes: in 2001, LEGO tried to copyright terms from Maori and various Polynesian languages and even appropriated their mythology for the <em>Bionicle</em> toy line's entire 9 and a half year run, leading to a lawsuit that LEGO lost and were forced to remove the franchise's Polynesian-inspired elements. Depending on who told the story, both LEGO and the Maori have been painted as innocent victims, and there have even been accusations of racism. In fact, there was no lawsuit. LEGO settled the matter in a respectful way that was applauded at the time by everyone involved, both LEGO and the Maori came to a peaceful compromise rather than one winning and the other losing, and the whole ordeal was far more meticulous and less severe than people make it out to be. <br/>Much of the <em>Bionicle</em> franchise's very early visual aesthetic and parts of its in-universe lore <em>were</em> inspired by real-life Polynesian cultures, leading to some Maori activists hacking fan websites, harassing fans and even threatening to sue LEGO for misusing their language. But these people were mostly dismissed as Internet aggressors and did not represent the Maori as a whole. The legal core of the incident actually centered around the title of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> game, "<em>Tales of the Tohunga</em>", where Tohunga denoted a culturally and historically sensitive word for the Maori. News outlets falsely claimed the word described the "helpless" tribal villagers of <em>Bionicle</em> lore, but in the actual story they were far from helpless and they performed vital tasks to keep their culture and their island safe. After LEGO met with Maori cultural representatives, the word Tohunga was removed and replaced with "Matoran", the game's title was changed to "<em>Quest for the Toa</em>", other words were changed as well, and <em>Bionicle</em> lost most of its supposed mysticism and quasi-religious tone. Maori-inspired deities and traditional dance rituals were also written out before they were even properly introduced in the story. <br/>However, most of the Polynesian terminology was actually kept under the approval of the Maori, and two other terms that got removed alongside Tohunga (Goko-Kahu and Kewa) were placed back into <em>Bionicle</em> lore later on without any legal hassle. Furthermore, there were other factors at play than just the Maori: white, Western religious parents had also complained about <em>Bionicle</em>'s tone, leading to its mythology and spiritualism getting toned down. This all happened in 2001, mere months after the toy series had launched. The brand adopted a more generic fantasy and sci-fi tone for the rest of its run, and the lingering tribal elements were just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact">artifacts</a> that were almost fully done away with by 2004. But since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstInstallmentWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstInstallmentWins">First Installment Wins</a>, some still think the franchise was fully Polynesian-inspired for its entire 9 and a half year run, and people still bring up the never-happened lawsuit as proof of LEGO's "comeuppance" for their supposed "racism" against the Maori. Even one of the brand's original creators, Alastair Swinnerton thought the incident had been blown way out of proportion in retellings.
</li><li> Other misconceptions have crept into the series too, all based on people's limited perception of its first releases. <em>Bionicle</em> wasn't even the first LEGO action figure line made out of unusual <em>LEGO Technic</em> parts and ball-jointed limbs — <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Slizer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Slizer">Slizer</a></em> came out two years before. <em>Bionicle</em> did have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll">mask collecting quests</a>, but only at the beginning, and later on most characters only used one mask each. The series' signature setting of a beautiful island with tribal villages was also dropped midway through the line, and it was planned to be abandoned since the start — though the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle2015">2015 reboot</a> brought it back in full force.
</li><li> Greg Farshtey, known as the franchise's head writer, never held such a position. He was only the "main writer" in the sense that he penned the comics and most of the books, but he did not dictate the story. Bob Thompson was actually the true head writer from 2001 to 2005, but no replacement was elected after he had left. Instead, the full Story Team continued writing the plot as a group effort. Greg <em>did</em> write the online side stories and put huge twists and retcons into the lore by himself, but he was never officially the head writer.

<ul><li> The mysterious Indrid Cold from late 20th century American urban legends is also known as "the Grinning Man", a person sporting an inhuman, ear-to-ear grin. He is commonly tied to the legend of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMothman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMothman">The Mothman</a>, thanks mainly to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMothmanProphecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMothmanProphecies">The Mothman Prophecies</a> (both the book and its very loose film adaptation). Some say he's an otherworldly, godlike entity, an alien badly masquerading as a human, or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMenInBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMenInBlack">Man in Black</a>. In the original story, Cold (the name Indrid came from a later account) is just a normal looking guy with telepathic abilities who travels around in a bizarre flying ship. Woodrow Derenberger, the person who claims to have first met him, later said Indrid was an extraterrestrial human with many similar partners. Though Derenberger's accounts were unabashedly bizarre, not once did he claim Indrid Cold looked any different from a normal person. His most famous trait, the creepy grin, came from conflating his legend with unrelated and similarly unsubstantiated accounts of strange grinning people. His affiliation with the Mothman meanwhile originated from conspiracy theorists reaching for connections between separate weird events that had zilch to do with Derenberger's accounts.

In reality, while Mia did defend him and that was when they first met, and indeed he became her student afterwards, he was already studying to become a lawyer at this point, and his motivation for doing so had nothing to do with Mia. The <em>first game</em> establishes that his motivation was being defended by Miles (who was at the time being raised by his loving defence lawyer father, rather than his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMentor">Evil Mentor</a>) when his class accused him of stealing someone's lunch (although sometimes it's assumed that was simply retconned).

Her official height is listed as a mere 1.65 m, or 5 feet 4 inches. Then again, when compared to Sayori (1.57 m, or 5 feet 2 inches) and Natsuki (1.49 m, or 4 feet 11 inches), she can give this impression.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder15');">    Web Animation </div><div class="folder" id="folder15" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> A large number of fans argue that the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/YogscastMinecraftSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/YogscastMinecraftSeries">Yogscast Minecraft Series</a></em> is the first set of videos that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Yogscast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Yogscast">Yogscast</a> did. While it certainly projected them into the public eye, it is <em>not</em> true. Their first videos were actually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> ones, and were enough for them to develop a small but devoted fandom.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY">RWBY</a></em>:
<ul><li> Due to having a group of female monster-slayers as protagonists, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY">RWBY</a></em> is often thought to portray a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfActionGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfActionGirls">World of Action Girls</a>. Nothing in the setting implies that women are somehow inherently more badass and the hunstmen academies are portrayed as perfectly egalitarian every step of the way. Going by sheer numbers, there are actually <em>more</em> male fighters in the series than female ones - it's just that the members of team RWBY are the main focus most of the time.
</li><li> Yang is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PungeonMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PungeonMaster">Pungeon Master</a>, but this is only true in the comedy spinoff series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBYChibi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBYChibi">RWBY Chibi</a></em>. In the main series, she only says one pun in the first six seasons (back in the first episode of volume two). Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImageSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImageSong">Image Song</a> "Armed and Ready" is also a pun, but Yang herself isn't known for puns. The confusion comes because Yang's voice actress is fond of puns. Yang's volume two pun was an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn">Throw It In!</a> from her voice actress; she was supposed to say that she could tie cherry stems with her tongue.
</li><li> Weiss calls Ruby "dolt" all the time in fan-works, but she almost never uses it in the series.
</li></ul></li><li> It's often assumed that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomestarRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomestarRunner">Homestar Runner</a></em> takes place in the fictional nation of Strong Badia, but this is inaccurate. The central setting of the series is actually Free Country, USA; while Strong Badia refers to a specific field within its borders that Strong Bad has claimed as his own nation. Many viewers have sent Strong Bad emails demonstrating this confusion and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/StrongBadEmail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/StrongBadEmail">Strong Bad Email</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StrongBadEmailE154KeepCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StrongBadEmailE154KeepCool">keep cool</a>" has him explain that Strong Badia doesn't extend beyond the vacant lot he owns.

Milholland gets a lot of complaints grounded in this trope from readers; the most common objection is "Your comic didn't use to be mean," despite the fact that the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">main character sent a coat hanger to an ex-girlfriend as a baby shower present in the first strip</a></em>.

The confusion arises because this is what Roger uses when they have to fight, alongside the others' abilities, and because the eye in the hand hasn't been mentioned in a long time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyAndAggie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyAndAggie">Penny and Aggie</a></em> are not Canadian. In early strips, T and Gisèle put them in a purposefully ambiguous location on the Eastern Seaboard, and due to a previous collaboration by them set in Canada, many assumed this one to be set there as well, some ex-readers or (very) casual readers still so assuming. However, as strip became more plot-driven, T was forced to choose a side of the border, and the setting is now unarguably American <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">even to someone who's only read the comic proper</a>.

In reality, he simply said he was disabled, not <em>how</em> he was disabled, so it's unknown if his arms were broken.
</li><li> Another famous inside joke is referring to someone as "Kevin" if they admit that they, as children, thought that dogs were always male and cats were always female. This comes from a story about a weird kid named Kevin who supposedly thought this. However, what Kevin actually thought was that cats and dogs were the same animal, not that cats or dogs were single-gendered. People tend to mix up this story with the aforementioned common childhood belief.
