</div></div><p>So, you've got someone you deeply care about, and who cares just as much about you. However, you know the two of you cannot stay together: being near you, or just the fact that he loves you is putting him at risk. You tried telling him, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies">It's Not You, It's My Enemies</a>", but it didn't work—he knows he'll be in danger, and he's okay with that.

<p></p></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> gives us a rather gut-wrenching one: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In Chapter 112, Eren (Yes, <em>that</em> Eren) verbally assaults Mikasa over her devotion to him, claiming it was only due to her Ackermann genetic programming and likens her to a slave, to the point that it reduces her to tears and causes Mikasa to stop wearing the scarf Eren gave her when they first met. Come Chapter 130, and it turns out the Ackermann programming story was all a lie Eren made up, and that he had known she was in love with him for a long time; however, due to his Titan-Shifting powers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingOnBorrowedTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingOnBorrowedTime">slowly killing him</a> and his own plans to destroy all of humanity outside the walls with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">the Rumbling</a> he knew spurning her and driving her away was the only way to keep her from going down with him.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CastleInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CastleInTheSky">Castle in the Sky</a></em>, Sheeta makes a deal with Muska to let Pazu go free. It involves telling Pazu to return to his home town and forget about her, which he reluctantly does. Fortunately the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkyPirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkyPirate">Sky Pirate</a> Ma Dola points out to Pazu that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">Muska will undoubtably dispose of Sheeta once he finds Laputa</a> so Pazu joins with her gang to get her back.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>:
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lelouch does this a couple of times to Kallen in R2. In the first instance, he pretends that he was merely using Kallen as a pawn to drive her away, when in reality he was trying to save her from being killed by the rebelling Black Knights. He betrays his intentions with a soft, barely audible, "Live on, Kallen." In the second instance, when Kallen confronts the newly-crowned Emperor Lelouch about his parting sentence and kisses him, he feigns a lack of emotion to again drive her away and make sure that when he dies as part of his planned Zero Requiem, Kallen will not die with him</span>.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ironically, she caught on as she saw the Requiem in action, but by that point there was nothing she could do except watch and let it unfold.</span>
</li><li> The third <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationMovie">Compilation Movie</a> implies <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he was also doing it for the other Black Knights, as this time, they arent as convinced by his act and try reasoning with him to tell the truth. Schneizels men are the ones that try to kill him, much to the Black Knights objection, but Lelouch probably still doesnt want to put them in danger along with Kallen.</span>
</li><li> C. C. abandoned Mao with this in mind when she felt he was becoming too obsessed with her. It ended up backfiring big time, when Mao went insane due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">Geass incontinence</a>.
</li><li> Lelouch also does it to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nunnally when she asks if everything he did was for her.</span> Though granted <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she was also with Cornelia and Schneizel so it's not like he could have answered it truthfully anyway.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Miaka tries doing this to Tamahome in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi">Fushigi Yuugi</a></em> because, as she found out, as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginPower">priestess of Suzaku</a> she cannot be involved with her bodyguard. Later on, Tamahome in turns tries this on Miaka <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when he finds out that she will never be allowed to stay in the book, even if she wishes it to Suzaku</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em>, Hijikata knows that his life choices involve a lot of danger and will probably kill him. So he rejects Mitsuba (Okita's sister) to spare her that grief and give her the opportunity to find happiness with someone else.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HaouAiren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HaouAiren">Haou Airen</a></em>: Once Kurumi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome">Stockholm Syndrome</a> sets in, Hakuron tries this technique on her a lot because he realizes that his enemies will do horrible things to her if he appears to care for her. He even goes so far as to make her be Fuuron's mistress instead of his own. It doesn't work very well.
</li><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExaggeratedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExaggeratedTrope">particularly extreme example</a>, Chikane's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">rape</span> of Himeko in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KannazukiNoMiko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KannazukiNoMiko">Kannazuki no Miko</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kiznaiver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kiznaiver">Kiznaiver</a></em>: This trope is invoked twice in separated occasions, by Nico and Tenga. Both of them believe that the best way to deal with the fact that you have an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrequitedLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrequitedLove">Unrequited Love</a> for someone is to properly declare your feelings and then, be properly dumped, no matter how painful that is. It'll hurt, but it'll also help both to move on from that.
</li><li> One that ends disastrously in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheLunacyOfDukeVenomania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheLunacyOfDukeVenomania">The Lunacy Of Duke Venomania</a></em>: Gumina pretends to be disgusted with her friend Cherubim because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her betrothed, Cherubim's brother, thinks they're in love (which they are) and was planning to kill him</span>. Cherubim thinks that it's genuine hatred, and in response <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">slaughters his entire family, makes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a> to charm every woman he wants in order to get her back, becomes the titular Duke and goes slowly insane with lust before being murdered by the lover of one of his victims.</span>
</li><li> A particularly weird example happens in a filler arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Narutaru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Narutaru">Narutaru</a></em>. A boy who's in a coma but can still use his Dragon uses it to impersonate a friend and tell his young aunt that neither of them ever really liked her. His reasoning is that it'll help her overcome her incestuous crush on him and find new friends as well as soften the blow when he fakes his death to go into the sea with his Dragon and become one of the Virgins.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> This is what Sakura truly meant when she gave her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">infamous</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseConfession">fake love confession</a> to Naruto, hoping that he wouldn't keep hurting himself for her and Sasuke. It really didn't work how she wanted it to—he easily sees right through her, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">calls her out for lying</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking">rejects her outright</a> by telling her that he <strong>hates</strong> people who lie to themselves.
</li><li> Two years later, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLastNarutoTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLastNarutoTheMovie">The Last: Naruto the Movie</a></em>, Hinata reluctantly decides to do this to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Naruto by "rejecting" his first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfession">Love Confession</a> and "accepting" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Toneri's</a> marriage proposal so that she could have a better chance at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigSisterInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigSisterInstinct">saving her younger sister Hanabi</a> and the whole world. This time it <em>works</em>, albeit with a few bumps, and she immediately apologized to Naruto for it when he came to save her</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the shoujo manga <em>The One</em>, the male lead <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">seems to attempt to rape the female lead, who's explicitly told him that she has a crush on him, in order to protect her from being followed and perhaps harmed, either physically or in terms of her career as a model being ruined, by the minions of a very powerful person who is out to get his brother and him, by misleading the stalkers into thinking that he has no feelings at all for the female lead. Yes, it's convoluted</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> When Nami had returned to Arlong Park, she tried to act coldly to the then forming Straw Hats in order to keep them from Arlong's wrath. (Going as far as pretending to stab Usopp in front of Arlong). It doesn't work of course and in fact, against all odds, they end up <em>beating</em> Arlong and his crew.
</li><li> In Chopper's flashback, his father figure Hiriluk does this to spare Chopper from seeing him slowly die from an incurable disease. Chopper later follows Hiruluk and learns the truth, but his attempt to save him only hastens his death.
</li><li> And later in the series during Robin's flashback, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her mother Olvia</span> tries to do this to spare her from the World Government, but she can't deny Robin's pleas to her and breaks down.

Usagi doesn't take it so well at first since Mamoru refuses to give her at least an explanation as to why they shouldn't stay together, and Mamoru can barely keep up the facade of not liking her since he can still assist her and the other Senshi in fights against Droids. Not shockingly considering the themes of this show, it doesn't stick when Usagi eventually figures it all out and Mamoru finally can't keep up the charade anymore. The real kicker? The visions were actually being sent by his future self, who set up the scenario to ensure the two had a love that was strong enough to withstand the trials ahead.

While he isn't cruel, he still rebuffs her attempts to comfort him and bring him food and medicine, repeatedly driving her away and causing her to feel hurt and lonely. The real reason he keeps doing it is because he knows that there's something unnatural about his disease, and he's afraid that she'll catch it if she goes near him. It turns out that he's right on both counts. The disease is basically caused by an evil power and Usagi does eventually catch it, but doesn't care because she'd rather stay close to him.

</div><div class="indent"><strong>Misa:</strong> But he's a guy! That's disgusting. And he looks horrible. I don't think he even brushes his hair... It can't be. Why would you do this? Light, how do I stop you from seeing him? Is he blackmailing you?

</div><div class="indent"><strong>Misa:</strong> You'll leave him?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Light:</strong> No, Misa. I told you I can't resist him. The real reason I couldn't leave headquarters is because he always wants to have sex and I give in every time. We're almost constantly doing it. It started before I ever met you.

</div><div class="indent"><strong>Light:</strong> But we don't need to break up, Misa. Let me talk to him. We've had threesomes before, so maybe he'd be willing to let you join in, if I phrased it just right. However, you definitely have to gain some weight first. You don't turn me on at all the way you are now.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Misa:</strong> Threesomes! Threesomes!

You want me to be happy, don't you, Misa? This will make me very happy, and you'll be able to have sex with me that way.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Rem:</strong> Light Yagami, you're giving Ryuk more time, aren't you? This is... necessary.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Light:</strong> Misa, don't worry. Soon everything will be good. Just seduce Matsuda for me, okay? And, one more thing I just thought of.

Unfortunately, Margaret's efforts to spare Dave included pushing him into Blue's arms...so when the truth came out, it was too late.
