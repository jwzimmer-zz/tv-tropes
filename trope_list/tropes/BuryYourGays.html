</div></div><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>This trope is the presentation of deaths of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LGBT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LGBT">LGBT</a> characters where these characters are nominally able to be viewed as <em>more expendable</em> than their heteronormative counterparts. In this way, the death is treated as exceptional in its circumstances. In aggregate, queer characters are more likely to die than straight characters. Indeed, it may be because they seem to have less purpose compared to straight characters, or that the supposed natural conclusion of their story is an early death.
</p><p>The reasons for this trope have evolved somewhat over the years. For a good while, it was because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedHomosexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedHomosexual">Depraved Homosexual</a> trope and its ilk pretty much limited portrayals of explicitly gay characters to villainous characters, or at least characters who weren't given much respect by the narrative. This, conversely, meant that most of them would either die or be punished by the end. Even somewhat sympathetic characters would usually receive punishment, as their sexuality was perceived as a negative trait (similar to how one would write a sympathetic drug addict). However, as sensitivity to gay people became more mainstream, this then transitioned into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooGoodForThisSinfulEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooGoodForThisSinfulEarth">Too Good for This Sinful Earth</a> narrative, where stories would tackle the subject of homophobia and then depict LGBT characters as suffering victims who die tragic deaths from an uncaring world. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDiseaseThatShallNotBeNamed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDiseaseThatShallNotBeNamed">AIDS crisis</a> also contributed to this narrative, as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicAIDSStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicAIDSStory">Tragic AIDS Story</a> became its own archetype, popularized by films like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Philadelphia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a></em>. And then there are the cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooGay">But Not Too Gay</a> or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchLesbians">Bait-and-Switch Lesbians</a>, where creators manage to get the romance going but quickly avoid showing it in detail by killing off one of the relevant characters.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Also known as Dead Lesbian Syndrome, though that name has largely fallen out of use post-2015 and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetPeeveTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetPeeveTrope">the media riots about overuse of the trope</a>. And, as this public outcry restated, the problem isn't merely that gay characters are killed off: the problem is the tendency that gay characters are killed off in a story full of mostly straight characters, or when the characters are killed off because they are gay.
</p><p>Can be seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> in some cases, as gay and lesbian people are at a substantially higher risk for suicide and assault  see the tropes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayngstInducedSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayngstInducedSuicide">Gayngst-Induced Suicide</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomophobicHateCrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomophobicHateCrime">Homophobic Hate Crime</a>. The fact that AIDS hit the gay male community most prominently provided potent fresh fuel for this long running trope (which, like many things about the eighties, still has an effect on more recent works). There may also be a higher prevalence of this trope in Period Fiction because of its supposed realism since historically there was lots of homophobic persecution  though undoubtedly plenty of acceptance, too. Another issue, however is that the stories where gay people quietly lived out their lives in peace are often less documented, and considered less dramatically compelling for straight audiences, leading to what can still be a skewed picture of the past.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>However, sometimes gay characters die in fiction because, well, sometimes people die. There are many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">Anyone Can Die</a> stories: barring explicit differences in the treatments of the gay and straight deaths in these, it's not necessarily odd that the gay characters are dying. The occasional death of one in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFullOfGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFullOfGay">Cast Full of Gay</a> is unlikely to be notable, either.
</p><p>It's also, however, a question of a sheer numbers game. Even when there is a perfectly valid narrative reason for the writers to chose to kill off the character, or it serves the story perfectly, it's often the case that killing one queer character is removing the only positive representation within the narrative. Additionally, given the ratio of mainstream queer narratives that end in tragedy, compared to ones with a genuinely happy ending, any addition to the list of the dead is often greeted with dismay, no matter how technically well executed.

<ul><li> Marvel's <em>Freedom Ring</em> defied nearly all the gay stereotypes... other than the one about being allowed to live happily. Killed off within a month of Marvel E.I.C <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeQuesada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeQuesada">Joe Quesada</a> touting him as the company's top gay hero. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that Freedom Ring "was always planned as an inexperienced hero who would get beaten up constantly and probably die. I wanted to comment on the fact that most superheroes get their powers and are okay at it... and that's not how life works. During working on the book, I was also noticing that most gay characters... are all about being gay. Straight characters are well-rounded characters who like chicks. So I wanted to do a well-rounded character who just happened to like dudes. Then I decided to combine the two ideas." <em>Oops</em>. Robert Kirkman did apologize when he realized he had effectively killed off 20% of Marvel's gay male characters.
</li><li> Moondragon's death in Marvel's <em>Annihilation: Conquest</em> series. Considering how many characters died in the series, what makes Moondragon's treatment notable was the sheer brutality of it. In <em>Annihilation,</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Thanos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Thanos">Thanos</a> kidnaps her, uses her as a hostage, rips her ear off, and presents the ear to her lover Phyla. She survives <em>that</em> series, but in <em>Conquest</em> she finds herself permanently turned into a dragon before ultimately dying in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to protect Phyla. In a cruel twist, Moondragon later gets resurrected, just in time for Phyla to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a> during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheThanosImperative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheThanosImperative">The Thanos Imperative</a></em>. What makes it particularly annoying is that with Thanos, Star-Lord, Drax and now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Nova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Nova">Nova</a> all having been brought back, Phyla's death is the only one that's stuck.
</li><li> Marvel's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheOrder">The Order</a></em> axed some superfluous characters in the first issue, but one of the two main characters to die by the end of the series was the lesbian Mulholland Black. That said, she was also the youngest and the most innocent, her gang history aside.
</li><li> Brian K. Vaughan and Fiona Staples' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Saga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Saga">Saga</a></em> had no problem killing The Brand, cutting off her story arc far too soon. Meanwhile the way she died added no dignity to the moment.

Her lover Scandal Savage is left devastated although thankfully not insane or any more evil than before. Knockout was a "New God" and killed off with the rest in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis">Final Crisis</a></em> arc, so it gets a pass as her death didn't come off like such an afterthought within the confines of someone else's comic book or because of her lesbian relationship, and the writer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GailSimone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GailSimone">Gail Simone</a>, was not happy that the character had to die. It also helps that in the finale of <em>Secret Six</em> they go to Hell and get Knockout back, and it's shown in the reboot version of the series that she's in a quite happy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Polyamory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Polyamory">three way</a> marriage with Scandal and Liana, with a plan to start a family.

</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BirdsOfPrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BirdsOfPrey">Birds of Prey</a></em>, where one of the later arcs <em>looked</em> like it was playing this straight, seemingly killing off both Savant and Creote, two of the Birds' allies who were both in love with each other but hadn't gotten around to saying it. It turns out to be part of a plan to corner Oracle as Savant, who's suffering constant mental agony, plans to commit suicide and force her to watch. Creote had promised to help him die to put an end to his mental issues, but Oracle's able to convince them both to live. It's somewhat notable as this drew ire from the LGBT community, who had previously held the writer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GailSimone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GailSimone">Gail Simone</a>, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorWorship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorWorship">Creator Worship</a> levels, and the amount of backlash she got as a result of angry fans who didn't wait until the story had wrapped up led to her leaving previous community sites she heavily contributed to.

Being a super-powerful Kree Super Soldier, he's able to take down most of the team, and starts the fight by attacking Xavin, Karolina, Wiccan, and Hulkling first and disabling each of them in a single hit, snapping Xavin's neck in doing so and seemingly killing them, while their body and the other three are taken to the Cube to be tortured. This gets kinda iffy, however, as Karolina is a lesbian, Xavin is her lover who's gender fluid (though during the story was taking the form of male), and Wiccan and Hulkling are one of Marvel's most prominent gay couples. While they all make it out alive, we are treated to a disturbing scene of Wiccan being forced to watch Teddy get cut up and vivisected while unable to do anything to stop it.

Kirk's redshirt nephew Peter is deeply in love with medical tech Alex Freeman, and the two plan to marry. (Everyone charmingly takes this for granted.) Alex ends up the last person alive on a doomed research ship, killing himself seconds before the Regulan bloodworms get to him. This was probably supposed to be reminiscent of Robert Tomlinson and Angela Martine in the TOS episode "Balance of Terror". The episode is based on a script David Gerrold wrote for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayPanic">kept getting punted into the wastebasket</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay">For when the episode was originally envisioned, having gay characters in a relationship would be revolutionary, even if one of them died at the end</a>.

She believes the trope is still a key part of the genre today, which is why all her stories have tragic endings. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, Katy once fell in love with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">Ill Girl</a> who sponsored her stories, but the girl succumbed to her illness two weeks after their relationship began.

<ul><li> The <em>1919</em> German film <em>Anders als die Andern</em> (<em>Different from the Others</em>) used this trope to deliberate effect. It was genuinely trying to educate the public about the senseless persecution of gays and included real life sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld giving a lecture that homosexuality was completely natural. That said, the main character still gets thrown out of school, loses all of his clients, is blackmailed and eventually commits suicide.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AtomicBlonde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AtomicBlonde">Atomic Blonde</a></em>: Delphine, who enters a same-sex relationship with Lorraine, is brutally choked to death by Percival in the last act.

Though the lesbian couple in the film were not the only ones to die in the show, their fate was specifically mentioned in the sarcastic voice-over ending as not being based around the fact that their relationship was in any way evil. Of course, they also weren't the only people to die, just the only ones for whom it wasn't supposed to be a consequence or punishment of their wrongdoing according to that monologue.
</li></ul><ul><li> There's a montage in the documentary <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCelluloidCloset" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCelluloidCloset">The Celluloid Closet</a></em> (a history of homosexual depictions in film up through the early 1990s) of a <em>litany</em> of gay/lesbian characters either dying or being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedHomosexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedHomosexual">Depraved Homosexuals</a> or (most often) both.

He was so busy preparing for his death that day that he forgot to take the heart medicine keeping him alive.

</li><li> In the documentary <em>The Lavender Lens: 100 Years of Celluloid Queers</em>, there's a very striking montage towards the end of gay accidental death, murder and suicide scenes from various films, set to 'Another One Bites the Dust'.

In the book, the endings are somewhat more ambiguous, but it still counts.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBestExoticMarigoldHotel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBestExoticMarigoldHotel">The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel</a>: Graham dies almost immediately after he locates his long-lost lover.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay">Independence Day</a></em>:
<ul><li> Possibly, with Harvey Fierstein's character dying; the character is never confirmed as gay, but acts like a pretty stereotypical gay guy. Harvey's gay in real life.

This is more justifiable than many such examples though as it's in a war, plus this was real.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YouMightBeTheKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YouMightBeTheKiller">You Might Be the Killer</a></em>, Nancy mentions that she wants to go to culinary school with her girlfriend.

She didn't survive these tests, but he did. Also her imprisonment was due to being queer in the first place-the regime rounded them all up. However, unlike in many cases this is the point of the segment, to help highlight Norsefire's evil as it persecuted LGBT people just for existing, and she relates her experience later in a letter to V (without actually knowing who he is) along with wishing her love to him as a fellow human being, something which gave him strength (then Evey later, who gets it in a recreation of the situation). This is about the most positive use of the trope that can happen. Gordon, who's gay and in the closet as the result of this persecution, is also killed for having a Quran in his house which the secret police find after they raided it because he insulted Sutler.

</li><li> The Mina Davis books <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HungoverAndHandcuffed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HungoverAndHandcuffed">Hungover and Handcuffed</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AssholeYakuzaBoyfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AssholeYakuzaBoyfriend">Asshole Yakuza Boyfriend</a></em> are kind of an odd case; in the first one, it seems like Lucy is a victim of this, but the sequel and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> establish a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFullOfGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFullOfGay">Cast Full of Gay</a>, and dead (implicitly) straight characters dramatically outnumber dead LGBT characters, especially in proportion to the number of both in the books.
</li><li> James Baldwin's feel bad classic, <em>Giovanni's Room</em> is a stunning example. The novel is narrated by a sexually confused young man who is counting the hours before his lover is executed.
</li><li> Partially subverted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChinaMieville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChinaMieville">China Miéville</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IronCouncil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IronCouncil">Iron Council</a></em>: Cutter, who is gay, is one of the few characters to <em>survive</em> but his on-off boyfriend Judah is shot in one of the final scenes.
</li></ul><ul><li> C.J.L. Almquist's <em>The Queen's Tiara</em>, which is set in Sweden in 1792, has Tintomara, who pretty much personifies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractiveBentGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractiveBentGender">Attractive Bent-Gender</a>. Two sisters and their respective suitors fall in love with her, the men thinking she's a woman, the girls convinced that she's male (at least initially). The men fight a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath">Duel to the Death</a> over her, the sisters go insane, and Tintomara herself is eventually killed for her refusal to pick a gender role and stick with it.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials">His Dark Materials</a></em> trilogy, the angel Balthamos—half of a canon gay couple with Baruch—is one of several major characters to die. However, a prominent theme in the third book is how the Dust<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note19iil');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note19iil" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note19iil');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">elementary particle</span> from people's bodies spreads across the universe and allows for metaphysical reunion with loved ones. Since the angels are made entirely of Dust, it's possible Balthamos and Baruch get a happy ending after all.
</li><li> <em>The Front Runner</em>, while being one of the first modern novels to treat gays as people, still follows this trope.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePictureOfDorianGray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePictureOfDorianGray">The Picture of Dorian Gray</a></em>, in which all three main characters (Dorian Gray, Basil Hallward, and Henry Wotton) are heavily implied to be gay or bisexual, ends with two of them dead, Basil—the more obviously gay one—murdered by Dorian, who later effectively commits suicide. Like many of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OscarWilde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OscarWilde">Oscar Wilde</a>'s works, this likely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">reflects the difficulties of being a gay man in Victorian England</a> (Wilde himself eventually died of an infection contracted during his imprisonment for "gross indecency"—i.e. having sex with men).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KissOfTheSpiderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KissOfTheSpiderWoman">Kiss of the Spider Woman</a></em>, in which the gay protagonist demonstrates his new-found bravery by accepting a suicide mission to pass a message to political revolutionaries.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBookOfLostThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBookOfLostThings">The Book of Lost Things</a></em> features the knight Roland, who is trying to find out what happened to his lost lover, Raphael. He is, of course, dead. Roland ends up dying as well, once he finds out what happened.
</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PerryMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PerryMoore">Perry Moore</a> wrote his young adult novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hero">Hero</a></em> as a response to the use of this trope in superhero comics. There are several gay characters and several characters who die, but no overlap.
</li><li> A particularly grotesque version of this in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonScottCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonScottCard">Orson Scott Card</a>'s <em>Song Master</em>: Josif, who is bisexual, marries female Kyaren; they have a happy marriage except he warns her that he's attracted to the inhumanly gorgeous male protagonist, Ansset. She tells him that that's fine, she doesn't mind if he sleeps with Ansset; but he still continues to worry about it. Ansset and Josif do end up getting together. Unfortunately, treatments Ansset received as a boy soprano, to delay puberty, cause a weird chemical reaction, making sex intolerantly painful. Josif is hunted down and castrated as punishment for "raping" Ansset. Josif then dies. His wife remarries the next day and in the epilogue is said to be much happier in this more peaceful relationship.
</li><li> Hal Duncan's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBookOfAllHours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBookOfAllHours">The Book of All Hours</a></em> duology has the gay character Thomas "Puck" Messenger get murdered early on in the first book, leaving behind his lover Jack... and dies again and again across the multiverse, to the point that one version of Puck and Jack find a tomb full of hundreds if not thousands of dead versions of Puck. Puck's treatment is a harsh criticism of this trope from Duncan (as well as upon real-world anti-gay violence, specifically the murder of Matthew Shepard), who is very outspoken about gay rights, and several versions of Jack manage to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">save their Pucks</a> in the end.
</li><li> A plot point in <em>Darkship Thieves</em>. Max kept his orientation a secret, so his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">identity thief</a> doesn't realize he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterAlert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterAlert">given himself away</a> by ignoring the lover, Nat. Still, the book ends with one gay man dead and the other consumed by his need for revenge.
</li><li> Teenaged Harold's heroic death in <em>The Garden God</em> (1905). He dies saving his friend/lover's life; it's implied that this wipes out the 'sin' of his previous homosexual acts.
</li><li> <em>Der Tod in Venedig</em> (<em>Death in Venice</em>) (1912). Aschenbach expires on the beach, gazing at Tadzio.
</li></ul><ul><li> Played with in the <em>House of Night</em> series, which portrays gay relationships positively (if unrealistically/stereotypically). Jack is killed by Neferet as a sacrifice to Darkness, since he is a "pure" soul. While this is completely against the homosexuality = sin mentality of many of the other examples of this trope, it still prevents Jack and his boyfriend Damien from getting a happy ending.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RosemarySutcliff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RosemarySutcliff">Rosemary Sutcliff</a> wrote historical novels stuffed full of homeoeroticism but had only three explicitly gay characters. All three are minor:
<ul><li> Two of them, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordAtSunset" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordAtSunset">Sword at Sunset</a></em>, are heroic warriors whose love inspires them to greater heroism. However, one of them dies nobly in battle, whereat the other feels suicidal and ends up dying too, saving everybody's life in the process. Mind you, this was published in 1963.
</li><li> In <em>The Flowers of Adonis</em> (1969), the otherwise heterosexual Arcadius falls in love with a fellow soldier, who immediately dies off-screen between that scene and the next.
</li><li> The (heavily implied) romantic relationship between Thomas Keith and Tussun Bey in <em>Blood and Sand</em> ends with their bloody deaths, and the suicide of Thomas' wife. To be fair, a lot of heterosexual characters die in Sutcliff's novels also - she wrote a lot of wars.
</li></ul></li><li> In Ursula Zilinsky's <em>Middle Ground</em>, Johannes von Svestrom's lover Gabriel is killed in a burning tank and Svestrom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">acquires a death wish</a>, which only ends up winning him a lot of medals for bravery in combat. Svestrom intends shooting himself until he meets and loves Tyl von Pankow, Gabriel's nephew. The end of the book is ostensibly happy, with Tyl going to Svestrom, but you never see him arrive and he's been told that he has a 'short life-line' on his palm.

They have time to say they love each other before she dies.
</li><li> In Sylvia Plath's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBellJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBellJar">The Bell Jar</a></em>, Esther's friend Joan is gay, or at least bisexual. That plus various other life stresses lead to her coming to the same hospital as Esther. She later hangs herself. But Esther describes other lesbians, like the famous woman poet at her college, who are "weird," but doing all right.

Wilson describes a Gestapo-like interrogation of all pupils who are called, one by one, in front of a panel of teachers and urged to confess to the cardinal and disgusting sin of sodomy, so that they can repent and their souls may be saved before God. Knowing to confess to being gay means expulsion, disgrace, and lifelong ostracism, Babcock bluffs and lies his way out of it, although he is both frightened and intimidated. After the first flush of elation at having successfully lied to his teachers, he is pulled up cold by the appalling realization his lover is yet to be questioned. As the boys are being called in by alphabetical order, he realizes Geoffrey Wildeblood will have a long agonizing wait... eventually he discovers Geoffrey has fled the school and has killed himself, rather than face shame and disgrace.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AnotherPeriod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AnotherPeriod">Another Period</a></em> puts a comic (and <em>wildly</em> convoluted) spin on the trope. Turn-of-the-century debutantes Lillian and Beatrice Bellacourt are both married. Both of their husbands are not only flagrantly gay, but having an affair with each other. At one point, the sisters concoct a scheme to lose said husbands: they will be paid several million dollars to disappear, be declared legally dead, and allow the sisters to remarry. The husbands "disappear" only as far as the guest house, then accidentally show up during their own funeral.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em>: Fan favorite Sara Lance was killed in the Season 3 opener. <em>Everything</em> about this plot pissed off fans to no end, from killing off a bisexual character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">with no warning</a>, to the way the mystery of who killed her was drawn out, to the ultimate resolution of the mystery, and the way the other characters handled the death. Eventually the writers bowed to fan complaints and had Sara resurrected and restored in a multi-episode arc, which led to Sara becoming one of the stars of a new spin-off, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow">Legends of Tomorrow</a></em>.

</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AsTheWorldTurns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AsTheWorldTurns">As the World Turns</a></em>, Reid (one half of the show's gay couple) died after his car was hit by a train and his heart is going to be used to save someone else. To add insult to injury, with Luke (Reid's boyfriend) heartbroken and Noah (Luke's ex) rejected, the show's three gay characters as essentially the only ones without a happy ending. Reid also died before he and Luke could consummate their relationship.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>, which rather unsubtly implies a certain sapphic essence to the relationship between Talia and Susan, doesn't really go all the way to acknowledging that they were together before the episode in which Talia's personality is wiped, which is called "death".

For his part in the attempted coup, he was executed. All in the span of four episodes. Although in this case the Cylon relationship was heterosexual and his homosexual relationship was the nice one. It is also worth noting that his relationship with Hoshi was only revealed in a webisode, and not mentioned in the show proper.
</li><li> Admiral Cain's death. According to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary">DVD Commentary</a> for "Pegasus" this was <em>not</em> intentional. When Michelle Forbes read the line "She ate at our table..." she gave it an extra personal touch that the producers decided to build on in "Razor", making it a retroactive example of this trope.

</li><li> It later turns out that Mayfair's ex is still alive; she faked her death to flee the country. Bethany is not pleased when she finds out.
</li><li> Played straight with Mayfair's new girlfriend, who is brutally murdered.
</li><li> Mayfair herself dies when, while confronting Jane about betraying the team, she is shot in the back by Oscar, though justified as her death leads to Jane turning against Oscar and lead to the team finding out that Jane was a mole. The writers themselves have stated that in the light of the bury your gays trope controversy they would have made adjustments to her death but it was too late to do so. In fact, another show had gotten a <em>lot</em> of flack about it at nearly the time they planned this, resulting in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> moment for the writers, but keeping Mayfair purely because of that would've thrown off their plans for the show too much. The show gets less hate for it than some, though, because it has other LGBT characters who survive.

The religious institution seems to subvert its own trope somewhat with the master being portrayed, if not truly sympathetically, then certainly as permitting a last reconciliation between Frederick and Charles Sheldon without intruding on their private grief. The master delivers a powerful sermon on forgiveness, which is a powerful bit of writing in its own right and averts the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist">straw fundamentalist</a> stereotype quite significantly.

Meanwhile, his partner, who in present day still insists until near the end of the episode that he isn't gay (and to add insult to death, claims his partner also wasn't 'like that') is the one who lives. He lived because he broke things off the night they were supposed to go patrolling together.

There was ferocious backlash from cast members, the soap press and fans, many of whom thought the moment was an obvious attempt to appease conservative viewers who had returned for the 50th Anniversary. Ratings went down after a brief exploitation bump, and after a few years, Will was brought back from the dead. The new head writer at that time admitted Will was being resurrected to repair some of the damage to the show's reputation.

Making it even worse was that the show had just been canceled, giving the impression that they just had to get that death in before it was over. Viewers had had their eyes on the show right from the start as well, as in the pilot episode Cayne's voice was digitally lowered an octave. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> explained that Cayne is so convincing as a woman that they were afraid the audience wouldn't get that the character used to be a man.

Devlin was surprised, because he and Danny had been so distant from each other that Devlin simply did not have a clue. He also finds out that Kaufmann is gay and that he was Danny's boyfriend. Kaufmann and Devlin get into a shouting match, because Kaufmann thinks Devlin disapproves of the relationship. Devlin, on his part, feels that he would not have held that against Danny. Sadly, Kaufmann is found dead and disemboweled shortly afterwards. Devlin finds out later that Captain Shannon killed Danny and Kaufmann. Why? Because Shannon blames Devlin for the death of Shannon's wife, and so he murdered Danny for revenge. Shannon killed Kaufmann to frame Devlin. Naturally, Shannon is planning to kill Devlin. Despite this reasoning, Danny and Kaufmann are the first characters confirmed dead, and they were both gay, so the trope still stands.

He did not even have the chance to be reunited with his ex-boyfriend. Pretty much the only thing we know about him is that he was in a relationship with Shiro, and even that relied on heavy implication and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGay">Word of Gay</a> (which the creators <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchLesbians">played up in the hype</a> for the season). It was rather conspicuous when he was the only friend or family of one of the core cast to die when they returned to Earth; even the characters in prison camps made it out just fine.

A later scene includes a photo Garfield had of her and her partner.
